<PRE>Dear OWASP Friends,

We will have our May monthly as usual this month. Please note that we need
to start at 6:45 sharp and Chris's talk will start promptly at 7:00PM as he
needs to fly back to the east coast.

Please RSVP here: <A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Los-Angeles/events/61886212/">http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Los-Angeles/events/61886212/</A>

*Data Mining a Mountain of Zero Day Vulnerabilities*

Every day, software developers around the world, from Bangalore to
Silicon Valley, churn out millions of lines of insecure code. We used
static binary analysis on thousands of applications submitted to us by
large enterprises, commercial software vendors, open source projects,
and software outsourcers, to create an anonymized vulnerability data
set. By mining this data we can answer some interesting questions.

Which industries have the most secure and least secure code? What
types of mistakes do developers make most often? Which languages and
platforms have the apps with the most vulnerabilities? Should you be
most worried of internally built apps, open source, commercial
software, or outsourcers? These questions and many more will be
answered as we tunnel through zero day mountain.


*Bio:*

Chris Wysopal, Veracode&#8217;s CTO and Co-Founder, is responsible for the
company&#8217;s software security analysis capabilities. In 2008 he was
named one of InfoWorld's Top 25 CTO's and one of the 100 most
influential people in IT by eWeek. One of the original vulnerability
researchers and a member of L0pht Heavy Industries, he has testified
on Capitol Hill in the US on the subjects of government computer
security and how vulnerabilities are discovered in software. He is an
author of L0phtCrack and netcat for Windows. He is the lead author of
&#8220;The Art of Software Security Testing&#8221; published by Addison-Wesley.
