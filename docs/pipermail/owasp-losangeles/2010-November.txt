Subject: [Owasp-losangeles] OWASP OC Half Day Event - End of January
Message-ID: <AANLkTin9++iWmmNyuv=2EMP-GPjfbZ6fBJ4bfyC8gzvp@mail.gmail.com>

*Reply OFF list please*

We have 3 (good) speakers lined up and I'm looking for feedback on what day
of the week would work best for everyone.  Monday?  Friday?  Morning?
Afternoon?

A little background:


   - Half day event of speakers and discussion
   - Anticipate 75-150 attendees
   - *Cost will be very low* (under $50, free parking for some)
   - TBD Hosted at UC Irvine (not the same area as AppSec US 2010)
   - IF the conference is in the afternoon, we ma do training in the morning
   - Capture the flag run during the event


I'm tentatively planning holding the event on the morning of *1/31/2010*.
 What time?  9AM?

The proposed venue is the same room as the single day conference I organized
in 9/2009 (
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSec_Academia_Symposium_Irvine_09)

A real solicitation will be coming soon, but we're looking for
speakers/sponsors!

	starting 7:00PM
Message-ID: <AANLkTik-Dd4KB1vGSQ_iUGXyVMcuk874W24TujXxJnth@mail.gmail.com>

We have two presentations on November 17, and great Greek food. Please
RSVP here: http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1025602605

--- First Talk ---

Baking It In: Abuse-Resistant Web Applications

Speakers:

Al Huizenga runs product strategy and management for Mykonos Software,
a company focused on new ways to secure Web Applications from abuse.
Al has 11 years experience managing, releasing, and marketing
Web-based products and technologies in industry leading companies such
as Cognos Inc., Platform Computing, and Panorama Software. He is
fascinated by how the same technology attributes that drive Web
application adoption ? openness, transparency, and ubiquity ? also
represent severe risk to the businesses that use them.

Kyle Adams: As architect and lead developer for Mykonos Software, Kyle
Adams has final responsibility for code quality and technical
excellence. Mr. Adams is graduate of the Rochester Institute of
Technology, earning a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science with a minor
in Criminal Justice. He wrote his first password protection software
at age 10, started hacking incessantly, and was writing his own
encryption software by age 14. An AJAX expert and enthusiast, Mr.
Adams has worked on scores of web application projects as a freelancer
and entrepreneur.

Abstract:

Current solutions for securing Web applications at run-time rely
heavily on signatures to identify and respond to threats. But
signatures have become less effective at detecting threats over time,
and aren?t sufficient to address the sophisticated abusive behavior
that large, publicly exposed Web applications are subject to,
including page scraping, logic abuse, malicious automation, phishing,
and malware distribution.

The key shortcoming is a lack of application context ? without any
grounding in actual application and user behavior, signature-based
solutions can?t avoid flagging many false positives. This makes the
information they provide to administrators practically un-actionable.

In response, new approaches are emerging that focus on behavior, not
input signatures. One key trend is to enhance the application code
itself with detection points that provide more transparency into
malicious user behavior. This enables administrators to prevent
application abuse before bad users can establish an attack vector. In
this presentation, we?ll discuss the merits and challenges of this
approach. We?ll focus on specific examples, including the OWASP
AppSensor project and the Mykonos Security Appliance.

--- Second Talk ---

Stunext Worm

Speaker:

Liam O Murchu, Security Response at Symantec Corporation

Abstract:

Details coming soon. But for now, refer to Wikipedia.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet


--- Sponsor ---

Mykonos Software approaches Web application security differently. We
understand how Web applications are abused by criminal attackers to
steal data, commit fraud, or use company IP for un-intended tasks.

The Mykonos Security Appliance detects malicious abuse of web
applications before the damage is done. This software solution
profiles the abuse through intelligence gathering and responds to any
abuse in real-time ultimately preventing data theft, fraudulent
behavior and misuse of your Web properties.

We will have a dinner party at Tony P's in Marina del Rey. We will have a
brief technical talk and the rest of time will be spent on soliciting ideas
for 2011, networking and drinking (and eating of course).

For that, paid OWASP members (those who joined for $50/year and in good
standing) will get in free. It is also free for members who join (for
$50/year) that day (please join prior to the meeting and bring your
receipt). For the rest, there is $20 suggested donation.

Please let me know directly if you have questions/thoughts on this.

Safe holidays!

Hello,

 

GIAC is starting to build our exam development team for the new GIAC Web
Application Defender (GWEB) Certification!  If you are interested in being
part of this exam's development process and have experience in developing
and securing web applications, we would love to have you on the team!
Please respond with a brief bio of your secure web application experience
by Wednesday, Nov. 24th.

 

We have a need for Question Writers in November, December, January and
February.  You will be paid for your efforts, and may qualify for CMU's
you can use toward a GIAC recertification.  Don't worry if you are new to,
or a little rusty on your question writing skills; we have a wonderful,
brief workshop, updated guidance, and GIAC staff ready to help get you
going.

 

With your reply, please include a brief summary of your availability by
the month/week/etc so we can estimate how many resource hours we will have
available to us. (Other exam development tasks will follow in February
through March or April if you are not available in November through
January, but may have time in February, March and/or April.)

 

Thank you,
