Topic: Cucumber and friends: tools for security that matters

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) helps focus software development on
delivering prioritized, verifiable business value by providing a
common vocabulary that spans the divide between Business and
Technology. Cucumber is a widely used tool in Ruby community for
implementing BDD and it executes plain-text functional descriptions as
automated tests. In this talk, Mani and Tin will discuss how Cucumber
and related tools can be used to define and verify security features
that matter in software.

Mani Tadayon, Senior Software Engineer, AT&amp;T Interactive

At AT&amp;T Interactive, Mani is part of the team responsible for YP.com.
Mani studied foreign languages at UC Berkeley, computer science at Cal
State Hayward and is now a graduate student in Geography at Cal State
Northridge. He has been developing web applications using open source
tools for over 10 years. Currently, his focus is on behavior-driven
development with Ruby.

Tin Zaw, OWASP and AT&amp;T Interactive

Tin is currently the president of OWASP Los Angeles chapter. During
day time, he works with Mani at AT&amp;T Interactive as an application
security architect. Before AT&amp;T, he worked as a software engineer,
manager and researcher at QUALCOMM, Inktomi (now Yahoo!), Symantec,
MySpace and a Sequoia funded Internet infrastructure startup.

Tin holds CISSP and CSSLP certifications from (ISC)2, MS in Computer
Science from University of Southern California, and working on an MBA
from USC.

Topic: passw3rd: friends don't let friends store passwords in source code

Passw3rd is a encryption library intended to encrypt and store
passwords outside of source code. This is a problem that has been
solved in hundreds of half-baked ways, or it is a problem that is
often overlooked.
Speaker: Neil Matatall

Neil Matatall is an independent contractor who has an equal background
in development and information security. After graduating from UC
Irvine with a specialization in networks and distributed systems, Neil
entered the workforce and became heavily involved in communities.
After becoming the leader for the OWASP Orange County Chapter, Neil
helped organize two conferences including AppSec USA 2010. He was also
a part of the OWASP Summit of 2011. Neil's new work is focused on Rub,
logging, and analytics with a strong interest in Ruby on Rails.
