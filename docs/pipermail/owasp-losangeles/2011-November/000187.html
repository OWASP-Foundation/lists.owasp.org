I have evidence showing that tw telecom has hacked into my charter cable router @ home. My husband is an engineer for TW telecom. Recently he was in the orange county region &amp; now is in the Los Angeles market. I have read several stories on the Internet one being Kory Baker story

My husband and I are living this same story. I believe this was initiated by Miles who is a top executive at tw telecom in southern ca. We are not sure who to go for help. Please google this person who is my next door neighbor.

We believe this guy is the hacker who is hacking for TW Telecom. Our phones have also been compromised several times. All information is greatly appreciated.
