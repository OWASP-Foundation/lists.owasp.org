Subject: [Owasp-losangeles] Need a volunteer who can help with a one page
	flyer for our chapter

Dear OWASP Friends,

I need help of a person who can help me make a one page color flyer for our
chapter. You don't have to be the best graphics artist, just be someone who
is familiar with type setting programs, even MS Word, and be patient enough
to work with me (just kidding ... I am pretty easy to work with).

I have some samples and some ideas on what I want. Please reply to me
directly (not to the mailing list).

Thanks.

*Abstract: Database Security in the Real World*

This presentation will provide an overview of the common threats and vectors
that are leveraged by real world attackers to gain unauthorized access to
high value databases. It is well understood that high value databases
support critical applications and store sensitive information, but they can
also be used to escalate privileges in Windows environments and propagate
botnets across the internet. This presentation will provide developers and
system administrators with a better understanding of how those attacks are
conducted.
