<PRE>Dear OWASP members,

We have been hearing from industry experts, practitioners and thought
leaders about web and security every month. I thought we could learn a
lot from each other too, as we all are security practitioners. I would
like to ask all of you to consider presenting at the local meeting.

As such, Edward Bonver of Symantec has kindly agreed to lead a
presentation called &quot;Threat Modeling -- Theory and Practice&quot;. Edward
will lead the presentation with some background on threat modeling and
then will discuss how it is practiced at Symantec. I would like to ask
at least two members to join him in discussing how threat modeling is
practiced at their organizations, best practices and pitfalls. Of
course, no proprietary or private information needs to be disclosed,
this is for pure educational and informational purposes.

This is to be presented for April or June meeting, depending on your
(and Edward's) availability and out-of-town speaker availability.

Please let me know if you are interested in this presentation, or
presenting other topics. Please feel free to spread the word.

Best regards,
Tin
</PRE>
