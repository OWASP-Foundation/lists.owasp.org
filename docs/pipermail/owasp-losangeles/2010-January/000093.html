Wednesday, January 20th, 2010 7:30PM

 Meeting Location
 Symantec Corporation
 900 Corporate Pointe
 Culver City, CA 90230
 Laguna Conference Room

Topic: Do VLANs allow for good application security?

Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) are not a new concept, and can
help any organization better control network access. I will present
some of the previous issues identified, what was the root cause, and
how these have been fixed in current technology. In addition we will
talk about how this can help to enhance security in your environment,
and what controls must be in place in order to implement such an
environment. We will also touch on how this can complicate your
application environment, but improve overall security.
I will touch on the controls that need to be reviewed and audited when
working with VMware, VLANs, and web applications, to ensure that these
networks are secure, and what to look for to potentially pass audit
criteria. I will also talk about where and how these controls have
been implemented in order to protect thousands of users while
accessing one of the most hostile networks in the world.
