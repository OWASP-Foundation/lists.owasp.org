<PRE>Hapy New Year everyone,

Besides our meeting on Jan 20th, ISSA is also meeting on Jan 20th during
lunch time. The topic is &quot;Meeting the Crisis of Online Bank Theft&quot;. One of
the presenters is Stan Stahl, ISSA LA president and a very engaging speaker.

See information below for details.

Greetings!
Information Systems Security Association
Los Angeles Chapter
January 2010 Member Meeting Luncheon
The ISSA LA Chapter cordially invites you to the first meeting of 2010.  We
have an exciting and interesting topic that you will enjoy and benefit from
hearing about.
The title is &quot;Meeting the Crisis of Online Bank Theft&quot;

Our speakers are:
Brad Maryman, FBI-Retired, Maryman and Associates
Stan Stahl, PhD, Citadel Information Group, ISSA-LA President

Talk Summary: An accounting clerk in a hospital received an email,
ostensibly from Facebook, inviting her to connect with a friend from junior
high school. She clicked on the link, installing a Trojan on her
workstation. Over the next 10 days, cybercriminals used the information from
the Trojan horse to initiate online banking transactions, stealing $600,000
from the hospital's bank accounts. The FBI estimates that crimes like this
occur every day with over $100,000,000 already stolen by cybercriminals
using a new breed of malware like Zeus. These new attacks bypass traditional
anti-malware defenses and are even defeating 2nd-factor authentication.
Attacks are often targeted, relying on social engineering to install their
payload. We will discuss the challenges faced by businesses doing online
banking and the banks who serve them. We will also discuss a new ISSA-LA
joint initiative with law enforcement and other organizations to help the
community deal with this new threat.
