<PRE>AppSec USA 2010 will be held from September 7 to September 10 at
University of California at Irvine. We are very pleased to announce
that OWASP Los Angeles and Orange County chapters will be hosting the
event. It is an OWASP national event and we are very excited to be
hosting it. More information such as Call for Presentations, Call for
Trainers, conference web page, will be sent out as soon as they become
available.

If you are interested in volunteering for the event, please let me
know at tin.zaw &lt;at&gt; owasp.org. Volunteer opportunities include
spreading the word about the conference, reviewing conference
submissions (presentations and training sessions), recruiting
sponsors, helping presenters with logistics and activities during
conference days (and more as we discover).

We are also interested in sponsors for the event. Sponsor information
should be available soon and if you are interested in sponsoring, or
know someone who might be a good sponsor, please let me know.

Thank you!
</PRE>
