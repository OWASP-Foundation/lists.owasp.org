OK, it's an April fool joke, or at least wishful thinking.

Seriously though, we are recruiting corporate members. Corporate
membership is 100% tax deductible, since OWASP Foundation is a
non-profit. 40% of the donation stays with the local chapter to
support our meeting refreshments, speakers' travel (if necessary),
etc. You can read more about it here
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership). If your organization is a
good candidate to join, please let me know.

Good news though is that we do have a really good presentation this
month, on April 21st, at Symantec offices in Culver City, starting at
usual 7:30PM.?Registration is now open at
http://owaspla.eventbrite.com/. I hope to see you there!

Topic:?The intersection of social and technical attacks in Web 2.0 applications

Speakers: Mike Bailey and Mike Murray

Mike Bailey is a senior security researcher at MAD Security and an
application security specialist. While his research spans a wide
variety of domains, it generally focuses on secure web application
development, web application scanning and penetration testing, online
privacy issues, network protocols and services, and how to break them.
 Mike has spoken throughout the country at different security
conferences and shows, including Blackhat DC, Toorcon, Defcon and
others. Aside from coming up with new and interesting ways to break
web and client-side applications, he also puts those attacks into
practice as a penetration tester. Currently, Mike is studying the
intersection of social and technical attacks in Web 2.0 applications.
He publishes his research on the MAD Security blog as well as at
Skeptikal.org.

Mike Murray has spent his entire career in information security and
currently leads the delivery arm of MAD Security (MADSecInc.com).
Mike is a co-founder of InfoSecLeaders.com where he writes and talks
about the skills and strategies for building a long-term career in
information security.  Mike's on security careers have been seen at
major conferences like RSA and Defcon.

All the best,
Tin

Never before has it been so important for our business leaders to learn
about the dangers of cybercrime and what they need to do to protect their
organizations from loss.

We designed the morning of our Information Security Summit to provide
business leaders with the vital information they need to know.

   - What is the cybercrime epidemic all about?
   - What do I need to do to protect my organization?

We hope to feature a keynote address by *Howard Schmidt,*newly appointed
White House Cybersecurity Coordinator, however we cannot yet confirm this.

This year's Summit features Keynote Presentations by

   - *Brian Krebs**, **Award-winning cybersecurity journalist, author of the
   blog KrebsOnSecurity.com*
   - *Ira Winkler,** Internationally known information security speaker and
   author*


Not just for the information security professional, the Summit will build on
last year's tradition of being the single educational forum in Los Angeles
specifically designed to encourage participation and interaction among three
vital information security constituencies:

   - *Business Leaders: CEOs, COOs, CFOs, Managing Partners *and other
   non-technical decision makers with top-level management responsibility for
   information security and for compliance with information privacy laws and
   regulations, together with their Trusted Advisors.
   - *Technology Leaders: CIOs, Technical Managers and other IT
   professionals* with responsibility for maintaining the IT network and the
   data it contains
   - *Information Systems Security Leaders: CISOs and other information
   security specialists* having day-to-day responsibility for ensuring the
   security of sensitive information, together with those responsible for
   auditing systems security.

ISSA, OWASP & ISACA Member / Student (prior to April 22nd) $75
