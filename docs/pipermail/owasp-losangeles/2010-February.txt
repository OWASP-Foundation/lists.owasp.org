February meeting speaker is Alex Stamos, topic is Cloud Computing
Security. It is an updated talk of the one he presented at OWASP
meeting and ISSA-LA conference last year.

It will be hosted at AT&T Interactive in Glendale. I will send out
directions and (free) parking information. It will be on February 24
(NOT February 17 as usual) because of my travel schedule. I hope this
will give a chance for those on east side of downtown to come to OWASP
meeting.

March meeting will be at Symantec in Culver City. Speaker is Mike
Schrenk, author of "Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers" It will be
on March 17.

I will send out more information as soon as it becomes available.

Best,

Cloud Computing Security: Raining on the Trendy New Parade

Cloud computing is an unstoppable meme at the CIO level, and will
dominate corporate IT planning for the next several years. Although
they do offer the promise of cost savings for many organizations, the
basic ideas behind abstracting out the corporate datacenter greatly
complicates the tasks of securing and auditing these systems. While
there has been excellent research into low-level hypervisor and
virtualization bugs, there has been little public discussion of the
?big picture? problems for cloud computing. These include virtualized
network devices, browser same-origin issues, credential management and
many interesting legal challenges.

Our goal with this talk will be to explore the different attack
scenarios that exist in the cloud computing world and to provide a
comparison between the security models of the leading cloud computing
platforms. We will discuss how current attacks against applications
and infrastructure are changed with cloud computing, as well as
introduce the audience to new types of vulnerabilities that are unique
to cloud computing. Attendees will learn how to analyze the threat
posed to them by cloud computing platforms as either providers or
consumers of software built on these new platforms. Our platforms for
discussion include Salesforce.com, Google Apps, Microsoft Office Live,
Google AppEngine, Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2, and Sun.
