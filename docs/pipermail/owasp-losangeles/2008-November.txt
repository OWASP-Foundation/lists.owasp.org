ACSAC 2008 Early Registration Deadline Approaching!


We invite you to attend this year's ACSAC conference in Anaheim, CA. We have
an outstanding program (http://www.acsac.org/2008/program) organized in
three tracks, featuring invited speakers, peer-reviewed technical papers,
case studies, tutorials, a workshop, a works in progress session and panels.
There will be plenty of opportunities to network with your colleagues from
around the globe, and if you are a CISSP, to earn continued education
credits.

The advance program is posted and registration is open at
http://www.acsac.org/2008/registration. The deadline for securing the
early registration discount and hotel room discount is November 15, 2008.
Please make sure you reserve your hotel room (http://www.acsac.org/hotel)
before you register for the conference in order to get the hotel room
discount on the registration fee.


Program highlights include:

* Two days of tutorials on leading edge topics, including: data mining for
intrusion detection, securing PHP web applications, cryptographic techniques
for digital rights management, analysis of large-scale network data, web
services security, web injection attacks, and application security risk
analysis.  Worth noting, for those of you with CISSP (or companies requiring
continuous learning), ACSAC Tutorials are an excellent way of staying
up-to-date with current trends and technologies in our area of expertise.

* A full day workshop on Virtualization Security

* 42 refereed papers, 6 case studies sessions, 3 panels, and our always
popular Works in Progress session.  Together these cover a wide range of
research topics, from security for Web 2.0 and mobile computing to malware
and forensics, as well as practical information on topics such as the
federal government software assurance initiatives and DNI-DOD Certification
and Accreditation.

* Exciting plenary sessions featuring our four invited talks:

     -- Whitfield Diffie, this year's Distinguished Practitioner, will
        talk about (in)security in a web-services world, drawing parallels
        from previous disruptive technologies

     -- O. Sami Saydjari, CEO of Cyber Defense Agency LLC, will describe a
        blueprint for a cyber Manhattan Project

     -- Stephanie Forrest will revisit the use of system call monitoring
        and biological analogies as applied to intrusion detection

     -- Barbara Fraser and Stephen Crocker will talk about the changes in
        network security and network security requirements since RFC 1281
        was written 17 years ago

Last but not least: The social events include a welcome reception on
Tuesday night, a dinner on Wednesday night, and an optional whale watching
cruise on Friday afternoon.

We hope to see you in Anaheim!

*A new web attack vector: Script Fragmentation*



This presentation will introduce a new web-based attack vector which

utilizes client-side scripting to fragment malicious web content.



This involves distributing web exploits in a asynchronous manner to

evade signature detection. Similar to TCP fragmentation attacks, which

are still an issue in current IDS/IPS products, This attack vector

involves sending any web exploit in fragments and uses the already

existing components within the web browser to reassemble and execute

the exploit.



Our presentation will discuss this attack vector used to evade both

gateway and client side detection. We will show several proof of

concepts containing common readily available web exploits.



*Stephan Chenette* is a Senior Security Researcher who helps lead Websense
Security

Labs working on malcode detection techniques. Mr. Chenette specializes

in research tools ranging from kernel-land sandboxes, to static

analysis scanners. He has released public analyses on various

vulnerabilities and malware. Prior to joining Websense, Stephan was a

security software engineer for 4 years working in research and product

development at eEye Digital Security.
