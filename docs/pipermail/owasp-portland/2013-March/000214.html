I've only received one reply to this request...

I know how many people are on this mailing list and how many of them are
eager to learn more about security.  So I find a ~1% response rate to be
pretty sad.

What are you most interested in?   Reply on or off list as you desire.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jim Manico has offered to give another talk for us, tentatively 
</I>&gt;<i> scheduled for June 5.  Here are some of the topics he offered to 
</I>&gt;<i> present. Please let me know which of these interest you the most:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ===
</I>&gt;<i> Title: Top Ten Web Defenses
</I>&gt;<i> We cannot firewall or patch our way to secure websites. In the past, 
</I>&gt;<i> security professionals thought firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), 
</I>&gt;<i> patching, and privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these 
</I>&gt;<i> methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on prominent, 
</I>&gt;<i> well-protected websites are occurring every day. Citigroup, PBS, Sega,
</I>
&gt;<i> Nintendo, Gawker, AT&amp;T, the CIA, the US Senate, NASA, Nasdaq, the 
</I>&gt;<i> NYSE, Zynga, and thousands of others have something in common  all 
</I>&gt;<i> have had websites compromised in the last year. No company or industry
</I>
&gt;<i> is immune. Programmers need to learn to build websites differently.
</I>&gt;<i> This talk will review the top coding techniques developers need to 
</I>&gt;<i> master in order to build a low-risk, high-security web application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Title: Securing the SDLC
</I>&gt;<i> The earlier you address security in the engineering of software, the 
</I>&gt;<i> less expensive it will be for your organization. This talk will not 
</I>&gt;<i> only discuss critical security activities necessary to build secure 
</I>&gt;<i> software, but it will also address the unique aspects of secure 
</I>&gt;<i> software creation specific to various cloud architectures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Title: Authentication Best Practices for Developers This module will 
</I>&gt;<i> discuss the security mechanisms found within an authentication (AuthN)
</I>
&gt;<i> layer of a web application.  We will review a series of historical 
</I>&gt;<i> authentication threats. We will also discuss a variety of 
</I>&gt;<i> authentication design patterns necessary to build a low-risk 
</I>&gt;<i> high-security web application. Session management threats and best 
</I>&gt;<i> practices will also be covered. This module will include several 
</I>&gt;<i> technical demonstrations and code review labs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Title: Access Control Design Best Practices Access Control is a 
</I>&gt;<i> necessary security control at almost every layer within a web 
</I>&gt;<i> application. This talk will discuss several of the key access control 
</I>&gt;<i> anti-patterns commonly found during website security audits. These 
</I>&gt;<i> access control anti-patterns include hard-coded security policies, 
</I>&gt;<i> lack of horizontal access control, and &quot;fail open&quot; access control 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms. In reviewing these and other access control problems, we 
</I>&gt;<i> will discuss and design a positive access control mechanism that is 
</I>&gt;<i> data contextual, activity based, configurable, flexible, and 
</I>&gt;<i> deny-by-default - among other positive design attributes that make up 
</I>&gt;<i> a robust web-based access-control mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Title: Cross Site Site Scripting Advanced Defense This talk will 
</I>&gt;<i> discuss the past methods used for cross-site scripting
</I>&gt;<i> (XSS) defense that were only partially effective. Learning from these 
</I>&gt;<i> lessons, we will also discuss present day defensive methodologies that
</I>
&gt;<i> are effective, but place an undue burden on the developer. We will 
</I>&gt;<i> then finish with a discussion of advanced XSS defense methodologies 
</I>&gt;<i> that shift the burden of XSS defense from the developer to various 
</I>&gt;<i> frameworks. These include auto-escaping template technologies, 
</I>&gt;<i> browser-based defenses such as Content Security Policy, and other 
</I>&gt;<i> Javascript sandboxes such as the Google CAJA project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Build Application Security Controls into Legal Contracts Every large 
</I>&gt;<i> organization is building web application software in some way, 
</I>&gt;<i> normally at great expense. It is a significant organizational and 
</I>&gt;<i> technical challenge simply to complete complex software projects. It 
</I>&gt;<i> is and even greater challenge to do so in a secure fashion.The earlier
</I>
&gt;<i> security is addressed in the engineering of software, the less 
</I>&gt;<i> expensive it will be for your organization. This talk will discuss 
</I>&gt;<i> several critical web application security-centric computer programming
</I>
&gt;<i> techniques necessary to build low-risk web-based applications. This 
</I>&gt;<i> talk will also describe strategic ways to add prescriptive security 
</I>&gt;<i> control contract language into software procurement or outsourcing 
</I>&gt;<i> contract language to encourage even third party developers to build
</I>secure code.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BIO: Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat 
</I>&gt;<i> Security, a web security firm. He authors and delivers developer 
</I>&gt;<i> security awareness training for WhiteHat Security and has a background
</I>
&gt;<i> as a software developer and architect. Jim is also a global board 
</I>&gt;<i> member for the OWASP foundation. He manages and participates in 
</I>&gt;<i> several OWASP projects, including the OWASP cheat sheet series and the
</I>OWASP podcast series.

Thanks for the reminder, Tim.

My top picks would be:

 &gt;&gt; Title: Securing the SDLC
 &gt;&gt; Title: Access Control Design Best Practices

I think the reason that I forgot to reply is that I meant to forward
this to some colleagues (and I was on vacation when this came out), so
I'll do that now and perhaps I'll scare up some more interest.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jim Manico has offered to give another talk for us, tentatively 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scheduled for June 5.  Here are some of the topics he offered to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; present. Please let me know which of these interest you the most:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ===
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Title: Top Ten Web Defenses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We cannot firewall or patch our way to secure websites. In the past,
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; security professionals thought firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (SSL), patching, and privacy policies were enough. Today, however, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on prominent,
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; well-protected websites are occurring every day. Citigroup, PBS, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sega, Nintendo, Gawker, AT&amp;T, the CIA, the US Senate, NASA, Nasdaq, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the NYSE, Zynga, and
</I>&gt;<i> thousands
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of others have something in common  all have had websites 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compromised in the last year. No company or industry is immune.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Programmers need to
</I>&gt;<i> learn
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to build websites differently. This talk will review the top coding 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; techniques developers need to master in order to build a low-risk, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; high-security web application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Title: Securing the SDLC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The earlier you address security in the engineering of software, the
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; less expensive it will be for your organization. This talk will not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only discuss critical security activities necessary to build secure 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; software, but it will also address the unique aspects of secure 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; software creation specific to various cloud architectures.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Title: Authentication Best Practices for Developers This module will
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; discuss the security mechanisms found within an authentication
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (AuthN) layer of a web application.  We will review a series of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; historical authentication threats. We will also discuss a variety of
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; authentication design patterns necessary to build a low-risk 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; high-security web application. Session management threats and best 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; practices will also be covered. This module will include several
</I>&gt;<i> technical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; demonstrations and code review labs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Title: Access Control Design Best Practices Access Control is a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; necessary security control at almost every layer within a web 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application. This talk will discuss several of the key
</I>&gt;<i> access
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control anti-patterns commonly found during website security audits.
</I>&gt;<i> These
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; access control anti-patterns include hard-coded security policies, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lack
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; horizontal access control, and &quot;fail open&quot; access control 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mechanisms. In reviewing these and other access control problems, we
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; will discuss and design a positive access control mechanism that is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data contextual, activity based, configurable, flexible, and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deny-by-default - among other positive design attributes that make 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up a robust web-based access-control mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Title: Cross Site Site Scripting Advanced Defense This talk will 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discuss the past methods used for cross-site scripting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (XSS) defense that were only partially effective. Learning from 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these lessons, we will also discuss present day defensive 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; methodologies that
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effective, but place an undue burden on the developer. We will then
</I>&gt;<i> finish
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a discussion of advanced XSS defense methodologies that shift 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the burden of XSS defense from the developer to various frameworks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; These include auto-escaping template technologies, browser-based 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defenses such as Content Security Policy, and other Javascript 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sandboxes such as the Google CAJA project.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Build Application Security Controls into Legal Contracts Every large
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; organization is building web application software in some
</I>&gt;<i> way,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; normally at great expense. It is a significant organizational and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technical challenge simply to complete complex software projects. It
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; is and even greater challenge to do so in a secure fashion.The 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; earlier security is addressed in the engineering of software, the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; less expensive it will be for your organization. This talk will 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discuss several critical web application security-centric computer 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; programming techniques
</I>&gt;<i> necessary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to build low-risk web-based applications. This talk will also 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; describe strategic ways to add prescriptive security control 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contract language
</I>&gt;<i> into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; software procurement or outsourcing contract language to encourage 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even third party developers to build secure code.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
