<PRE>
I've only received one reply to this request...

I know how many people are on this mailing list and how many of them
are eager to learn more about security.  So I find a ~1% response
rate to be pretty sad.

What are you most interested in?   Reply on or off list as you desire.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jim Manico has offered to give another talk for us, tentatively
</I>&gt;<i> scheduled for June 5.  Here are some of the topics he offered to
</I>&gt;<i> present. Please let me know which of these interest you the most:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ===
</I>&gt;<i> Title: Top Ten Web Defenses
</I>&gt;<i> We cannot firewall or patch our way to secure websites. In the past,
</I>&gt;<i> security professionals thought firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
</I>&gt;<i> patching, and privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these methods
</I>&gt;<i> are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on prominent, well-protected
</I>&gt;<i> websites are occurring every day. Citigroup, PBS, Sega, Nintendo, Gawker,
</I>&gt;<i> AT&amp;T, the CIA, the US Senate, NASA, Nasdaq, the NYSE, Zynga, and thousands
</I>&gt;<i> of others have something in common  all have had websites compromised in
</I>&gt;<i> the last year. No company or industry is immune. Programmers need to learn
</I>&gt;<i> to build websites differently. This talk will review the top coding
</I>&gt;<i> techniques developers need to master in order to build a low-risk,
</I>&gt;<i> high-security web application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Title: Securing the SDLC
</I>&gt;<i> The earlier you address security in the engineering of software, the less
</I>&gt;<i> expensive it will be for your organization. This talk will not only
</I>&gt;<i> discuss critical security activities necessary to build secure software,
</I>&gt;<i> but it will also address the unique aspects of secure software creation
</I>&gt;<i> specific to various cloud architectures.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Title: Authentication Best Practices for Developers
</I>&gt;<i> This module will discuss the security mechanisms found within an
</I>&gt;<i> authentication (AuthN) layer of a web application.  We will review a
</I>&gt;<i> series of historical authentication threats. We will also discuss a
</I>&gt;<i> variety of authentication design patterns necessary to build a low-risk
</I>&gt;<i> high-security web application. Session management threats and best                                            
</I>&gt;<i> practices will also be covered. This module will include several technical
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrations and code review labs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Title: Access Control Design Best Practices
</I>&gt;<i> Access Control is a necessary security control at almost every layer
</I>&gt;<i> within a web application. This talk will discuss several of the key access
</I>&gt;<i> control anti-patterns commonly found during website security audits. These
</I>&gt;<i> access control anti-patterns include hard-coded security policies, lack of
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal access control, and &quot;fail open&quot; access control mechanisms. In      
</I>&gt;<i> reviewing these and other access control problems, we will discuss and
</I>&gt;<i> design a positive access control mechanism that is data contextual,
</I>&gt;<i> activity based, configurable, flexible, and deny-by-default - among other
</I>&gt;<i> positive design attributes that make up a robust web-based access-control
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Title: Cross Site Site Scripting Advanced Defense
</I>&gt;<i> This talk will discuss the past methods used for cross-site scripting
</I>&gt;<i> (XSS) defense that were only partially effective. Learning from these
</I>&gt;<i> lessons, we will also discuss present day defensive methodologies that are                     
</I>&gt;<i> effective, but place an undue burden on the developer. We will then finish
</I>&gt;<i> with a discussion of advanced XSS defense methodologies that shift the
</I>&gt;<i> burden of XSS defense from the developer to various frameworks. These
</I>&gt;<i> include auto-escaping template technologies, browser-based defenses such
</I>&gt;<i> as Content Security Policy, and other Javascript sandboxes such as the
</I>&gt;<i> Google CAJA project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Build Application Security Controls into Legal Contracts
</I>&gt;<i> Every large organization is building web application software in some way,
</I>&gt;<i> normally at great expense. It is a significant organizational and
</I>&gt;<i> technical challenge simply to complete complex software projects. It is
</I>&gt;<i> and even greater challenge to do so in a secure fashion.The earlier
</I>&gt;<i> security is addressed in the engineering of software, the less expensive
</I>&gt;<i> it will be for your organization. This talk will discuss several critical
</I>&gt;<i> web application security-centric computer programming techniques necessary
</I>&gt;<i> to build low-risk web-based applications. This talk will also describe
</I>&gt;<i> strategic ways to add prescriptive security control contract language into
</I>&gt;<i> software procurement or outsourcing contract language to encourage even
</I>&gt;<i> third party developers to build secure code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BIO: Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security,
</I>&gt;<i> a web security firm. He authors and delivers developer security awareness
</I>&gt;<i> training for WhiteHat Security and has a background as a software
</I>&gt;<i> developer and architect. Jim is also a global board member for the
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP foundation. He manages and participates in several OWASP projects,
</I>&gt;<i> including the OWASP cheat sheet series and the OWASP podcast series.
