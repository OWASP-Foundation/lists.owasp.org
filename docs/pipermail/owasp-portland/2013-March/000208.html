<PRE>I'm definitely interested (apologies for the late reply).  My talk
preferences are:

1. Title: Cross Site Site Scripting Advanced Defense
2. Title: Top Ten Web Defenses
3. Title: Securing the SDLC

Also interested in more FLOSSHack.  :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jim Manico has offered to give another talk for us, tentatively
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scheduled for June 5.  Here are some of the topics he offered to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; present. Please let me know which of these interest you the most:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ===
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Title: Top Ten Web Defenses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We cannot firewall or patch our way to secure websites. In the past,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; security professionals thought firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; patching, and privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these methods
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on prominent, well-protected
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; websites are occurring every day. Citigroup, PBS, Sega, Nintendo, Gawker,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; AT&amp;T, the CIA, the US Senate, NASA, Nasdaq, the NYSE, Zynga, and
</I>&gt;<i> thousands
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of others have something in common  all have had websites compromised in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the last year. No company or industry is immune. Programmers need to
</I>&gt;<i> learn
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to build websites differently. This talk will review the top coding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; techniques developers need to master in order to build a low-risk,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; high-security web application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Title: Securing the SDLC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The earlier you address security in the engineering of software, the less
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expensive it will be for your organization. This talk will not only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discuss critical security activities necessary to build secure software,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but it will also address the unique aspects of secure software creation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specific to various cloud architectures.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Title: Authentication Best Practices for Developers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This module will discuss the security mechanisms found within an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authentication (AuthN) layer of a web application.  We will review a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; series of historical authentication threats. We will also discuss a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; variety of authentication design patterns necessary to build a low-risk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; high-security web application. Session management threats and best
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; practices will also be covered. This module will include several
</I>&gt;<i> technical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; demonstrations and code review labs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Title: Access Control Design Best Practices
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Access Control is a necessary security control at almost every layer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; within a web application. This talk will discuss several of the key
</I>&gt;<i> access
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control anti-patterns commonly found during website security audits.
</I>&gt;<i> These
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; access control anti-patterns include hard-coded security policies, lack
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; horizontal access control, and &quot;fail open&quot; access control mechanisms. In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reviewing these and other access control problems, we will discuss and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; design a positive access control mechanism that is data contextual,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; activity based, configurable, flexible, and deny-by-default - among other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; positive design attributes that make up a robust web-based access-control
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Title: Cross Site Site Scripting Advanced Defense
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This talk will discuss the past methods used for cross-site scripting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (XSS) defense that were only partially effective. Learning from these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lessons, we will also discuss present day defensive methodologies that
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effective, but place an undue burden on the developer. We will then
</I>&gt;<i> finish
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a discussion of advanced XSS defense methodologies that shift the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; burden of XSS defense from the developer to various frameworks. These
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; include auto-escaping template technologies, browser-based defenses such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as Content Security Policy, and other Javascript sandboxes such as the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Google CAJA project.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Build Application Security Controls into Legal Contracts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Every large organization is building web application software in some
</I>&gt;<i> way,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; normally at great expense. It is a significant organizational and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technical challenge simply to complete complex software projects. It is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and even greater challenge to do so in a secure fashion.The earlier
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; security is addressed in the engineering of software, the less expensive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it will be for your organization. This talk will discuss several critical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; web application security-centric computer programming techniques
</I>&gt;<i> necessary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to build low-risk web-based applications. This talk will also describe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; strategic ways to add prescriptive security control contract language
</I>&gt;<i> into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; software procurement or outsourcing contract language to encourage even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; third party developers to build secure code.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BIO: Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a web security firm. He authors and delivers developer security awareness
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; training for WhiteHat Security and has a background as a software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developer and architect. Jim is also a global board member for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OWASP foundation. He manages and participates in several OWASP projects,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; including the OWASP cheat sheet series and the OWASP podcast series.
