Not expereince with interpretation, since the law isn't that old, but I went
to a discussion of this statute soon after it became law. It is basically
Oregon's state privacy law, loosely modeled after California's SB1386, and others.

Somewhere around here, I have some guidance from the state on how they intended
to apply this roughly 2 years ago. I'll dig it up. 

The intent is that it does apply to just about everyone, and like most of the
first generation state privacy laws, isn't very prescriptive about how you
comply. For more granular, second generation state laws, look at what has been
passed in MA, MN, and NV in the last year or so; there's lots more detail 
about safeguards and requirements; NV's goes as far as to mandate an approach
modeled on PCI-DSS for personal information. 

My expectation is that the safeguards listed in section 622 are going to
get argued in court as due care issues; you should be able to demonstrate 
that with evidence of comliance to GLBA or HIPAA, as stated. Any of PCI-DSS,
ISO, NIST, COBIT, ITIL... or a solid InfoSec program or your own creation
could also suffice. It will be a up to lawyers and expert witnesses
to argue whether 622 is met or not when this gets applied to a breach.

Here's one example where the statute was used to coerce a settlement:

I'm not aware of much else generating press on this statute.

My company primarily works at assisting organizations to comply with
regulations such as GLB, SOX, HIPAA and NERC.  And so, we were very
interested when we saw Oregon pass data breach notification legislation.
 But what we've seen over the years is that organizations tend to pay
little attention to such things until it starts costing them money or
puts them at serious risk of loss.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley is proactively enforced.  But at first the examiners
didn't really have much knowledge of what they were looking for and the
industry norms were so poor that it was years before the financial
services organizations to which it applies really got serious about
implementing information security controls.

Sarbanes-Oxley was taken a bit more seriously right away because it
calls for strict accountability by the CEO.  But it only applies
directly to systems used in financial reporting and is more focused on
integrity rather than confidentiality.  So, I don't think the impact is
very large in terms of creating much actual security.  It helps.

NERC started out years ago with a bunch of standards that weren't really
enforced very proactively and didn't apply to many utilities.  Congress
changed that and FERC has been good about pushing the industry.  But it
wasn't until they were threatened with big fines that most utilities
started put serious resources toward security.

The same is true for HIPAA.  Large organizations have realized that they
want to stay out of the headlines and avoid fines.  There have also been
a few significantly publicized data breaches and fines handed out under
HIPAA.  The bulk of covered entities, however, still don't really have
their act together, from my perspective.  This is because there has been
no proactive enforcement in the past; it's only been complaint driven.
HITECH, integrated with ARRA changes that a bit, calling for proactive
audits, but we don't know yet how that will be implemented.

Given this history, I expect little to nothing to be done by businesses
to comply with Oregon (or any other state's) data breach notification
statutes until they start seeing their peers getting some significant
fines handed down and loosing business due to the publicity of breaches.
 Perhaps at some point the cost to comply will be less than the various
risks of getting caught with your pants down on this.

Subject: [Owasp-portland] Chapter meeting at OSCON in July?
Message-ID: <576A0118-BE6D-4D76-80E3-3555870A9D41@owasp.org>

Hi folks,

I am in the process of starting negotiations to hold a OWASP mini-conf at OSCON, which is held in late July. If the mini-conf goes ahead, I would need folks on the ground in Portland to help organize the mini-conf. The duties are generally not onerous - help on the day would be the most likely requirement. If you'd like to be involved, mail me seperately so I can guage the level of help I can expect as I talk to OSCON's organizers over the next week or so. 

If it goes ahead, please keep an eye out for a CFP if you'd like to speak at the event. 

Separately to this, OSCON were good to us last year and allowed me to hold a really last minute meeting there last year. This time around, I'd really like to involve the PDX chapter leadership in organizing their own meetings* :) and blow the attendance out for the meeting! I'm pretty sure we can make a meeting happen regardless if the mini-conf goes ahead. Would you folks be interested in holding a meeting in the early evening after OSCON at the convention center? 

I'd like to meet more of you. :)

thanks,
Andrew

* sorry about that! :)

Yeah, I guess this was the part I was interested in, related to how one
interprets an appropriate ways that one "Assesses the sufficiency of
safeguards in place to control the identified risks" if you are a sole
proprietorship vs. a 10000 employee corporation, etc.  I would imagine
many large organizations already feel the pressure to comply with many
other laws and would be able to argue their way through any of these
rules on how reasonable their security programs are.  But I wonder how
it would be interpreted for local small businesses.  I guess that is for
the courts to define when it comes up.

Interesting.  Maybe it just requires the press to get involved in order
to get this law applied. ;-)

Thanks for the info,
tim

Hi Mel,

Thanks for sharing your experiences.

Yes, I think that's an keen observation.  I frequently forget, and am
reminded with equal frequency, that decisions about compliance tend to
come down to some approximation of:

[cost of compliance] >? [cost of breach]*[chance of being caught]

In many cases, businesses estimate the likelihood of being caught to be
very low.  In the case of a new law like this, if no one has been
prosecuted under it, then businesses would be reasonable (statistically,
not ethically) in estimating that the likelihood of being caught is
precisely 0.

Regards,
tim
