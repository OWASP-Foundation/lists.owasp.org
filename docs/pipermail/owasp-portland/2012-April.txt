The PCI SSC has not finished developing the standards for assessing the "category 3" devices for PA-DSS certification (that is, validated payment application - this means it has been validated to support a PCI DSS compliant payment environment, not necessarily that using a PA-DSS validated application automatically makes you a PCI DSS compliant merchant).  Category 3 are the general purpose / consumer grade mobile apps.  Without having the formalized guidance form the council on the controls required for these apps from a PA-DSS perspective, assessing them as part of a PCI DSS assessment is problematic for a QSA - they have to use their judgment as to whether or not the app reasonable meets the intent of the broader PA-DSS requirements, without knowing what specific requirements for those type of apps will be forth-coming.  Some more guidance from the council here:

At the last chapter meeting the question was raised about how mobile CC devices like Square would fit into PCI. I asked the PCI expert at Nike and this was his reply. Please excuse the grammar and spelling, it was sent from his iPad.

The real answer is no one knows yet. The PCI SSC has been really vague on this. If they accept end to end encryption where the swipe device, in this case the Square Device, encrypts the data before the iPhone can get at it then the solution in itself could be PCI compliant.  But the real questions come around what happens is the iPhone can see the CC in the clear on the screen. Then IMHO the device would have to follow the rest of the PCI, like device hardening and the hardest; logging.



The PCI SSC has released an updated encryption document but is still very concerned about wireless devices; thank you TJ Max.



So in the end, it is what can you get your QSA to approve.



I would say that if you can should that the swipe device makes it so you can not get at the CC number , track data at all. And that the transport is encrypted, and you have solid controls over you devices. Then you should be able to get the solution easily approved without much additional controls.



On the other hand, if the CC is seen on the device, the work go a whole lot harder.

I tried to email it to the list Tuesday morning, but the list moderator
needs to approve it since the presentation is larger than a certain KB
size. If people want to send me their individual email addresses, I'll sent
you the presentation.

Subject: [Owasp-portland] FLOSSHack Details and Potential Targets
Message-ID: <4F9B6FF0.3060205@vsecurity.com>

Hi everyone,

Based on some feedback I received from my survey, it seems like a LAMP
application would best match peoples' interests in open source project targets.
 Based on recommendations from others and my own research, I'm proposing we do
the first FLOSSHack on one of the following apps:

  ResourceSpace <http://www.resourcespace.org/>
  selfoss <http://selfoss.aditu.de/>
  OpenDocMan <http://www.opendocman.com/>


I haven't actually looked at these terribly closely, but let me know if you have
any strong opinions about them.  In general, I think it would be most useful for
us to look at a project that has some kind of built-in access control system,
allows potentially untrusted users to submit persistent content, and of course
interacts in some way with a SQL database.  Also, projects that are under active
development are also strongly preferred.


I thought I'd also throw out some thoughts I had on how a typical FLOSSHack
session might go:

1. As I mentioned before, we'd choose the application and announce it officially
maybe a week (or more?) before the date of the FLOSSHack session.

2. At the beginning of the session, we may spend up to 30minutes going over
common vulnerabilities that might affect the application.  Perhaps even show
demos in WebGoat or something similar to ensure everyone has a good idea as to
what they are looking for.

3. Share vulnerabilities already found-- for those who have spent the prior week
looking for bugs, now would be the time they could share them with everyone
else.  Much discussion of the flaws, how they were found, and how they could be
exploited would ensue.

4. Start hacking.  A pre-installed version of the application will be provided
in some way, maybe on a VM or remotely.  Collaborate on searching for various
types of bugs.  Occasionally, when folks spot new vulnerabilities, announce it
and describe the bug to others.  Maybe the resulting discussion sparks new ideas
for finding additional flaws.  If things are "slow" in this area, perhaps the
FLOSSHack wrangler can stop everyone once in a while to cover some security
topic relevant to the application.

5. Conclude the session, hopefully, with a pile of security bugs to send off to
the developers in a responsible manner.  If we can find sponsors for this, maybe
we could have some prizes for those who find the most bugs, or the "best" bug
found, as voted on by the participants.


I expect a FLOSSHack session to last at least 2 hours.  I know that's pretty
long for some people's schedules, but it's designed as a workshop and it takes
quite a while to get familiar with an application.

I'm still not sure if it would be best to hold this kind of thing on a weeknight
or on a weekend.  What would people prefer?  If it makes sense, we could even
stretch it out into a longer weekend session (4 hours?) and then invite people
to come and go as they please; whatever fits peoples' schedules. I anticipate
setting up some way for people to join remotely as well.  Perhaps just via IRC,
IM, or some newfangled thing with moving pictures. (I'd appreciate volunteers to
help with this or anything else.)


Let me know what you all think.
Thanks and have a great weekend!
tim


PS - If anyone knows any college students who are interested in computer
security, this would be a great event for them.  Feel free to pass along info
about this event, or just get them signed up to the mailing list.

Vote for Resourcespace. It fits your criteria.
Moodle, wordpress, or joomla for future.
