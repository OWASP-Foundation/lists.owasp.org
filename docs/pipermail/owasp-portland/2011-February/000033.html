<PRE>Hi folks,

I am in the process of starting negotiations to hold a OWASP mini-conf at OSCON, which is held in late July. If the mini-conf goes ahead, I would need folks on the ground in Portland to help organize the mini-conf. The duties are generally not onerous - help on the day would be the most likely requirement. If you'd like to be involved, mail me seperately so I can guage the level of help I can expect as I talk to OSCON's organizers over the next week or so. 

If it goes ahead, please keep an eye out for a CFP if you'd like to speak at the event. 

Separately to this, OSCON were good to us last year and allowed me to hold a really last minute meeting there last year. This time around, I'd really like to involve the PDX chapter leadership in organizing their own meetings* :) and blow the attendance out for the meeting! I'm pretty sure we can make a meeting happen regardless if the mini-conf goes ahead. Would you folks be interested in holding a meeting in the early evening after OSCON at the convention center? 

I'd like to meet more of you. :)

thanks,
Andrew

* sorry about that! :)
