<PRE>My company primarily works at assisting organizations to comply with
regulations such as GLB, SOX, HIPAA and NERC.  And so, we were very
interested when we saw Oregon pass data breach notification legislation.
 But what we've seen over the years is that organizations tend to pay
little attention to such things until it starts costing them money or
puts them at serious risk of loss.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley is proactively enforced.  But at first the examiners
didn't really have much knowledge of what they were looking for and the
industry norms were so poor that it was years before the financial
services organizations to which it applies really got serious about
implementing information security controls.

Sarbanes-Oxley was taken a bit more seriously right away because it
calls for strict accountability by the CEO.  But it only applies
directly to systems used in financial reporting and is more focused on
integrity rather than confidentiality.  So, I don't think the impact is
very large in terms of creating much actual security.  It helps.

NERC started out years ago with a bunch of standards that weren't really
enforced very proactively and didn't apply to many utilities.  Congress
changed that and FERC has been good about pushing the industry.  But it
wasn't until they were threatened with big fines that most utilities
started put serious resources toward security.

The same is true for HIPAA.  Large organizations have realized that they
want to stay out of the headlines and avoid fines.  There have also been
a few significantly publicized data breaches and fines handed out under
HIPAA.  The bulk of covered entities, however, still don't really have
their act together, from my perspective.  This is because there has been
no proactive enforcement in the past; it's only been complaint driven.
HITECH, integrated with ARRA changes that a bit, calling for proactive
audits, but we don't know yet how that will be implemented.

Given this history, I expect little to nothing to be done by businesses
to comply with Oregon (or any other state's) data breach notification
statutes until they start seeing their peers getting some significant
fines handed down and loosing business due to the publicity of breaches.
 Perhaps at some point the cost to comply will be less than the various
risks of getting caught with your pants down on this.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not expereince with interpretation, since the law isn't that old, but I went

</I>&gt;<i> Oregon's state privacy law, loosely modeled after California's SB1386, and others.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Somewhere around here, I have some guidance from the state on how they intended
</I>&gt;<i> to apply this roughly 2 years ago. I'll dig it up. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The intent is that it does apply to just about everyone, and like most of the
</I>&gt;<i> first generation state privacy laws, isn't very prescriptive about how you
</I>&gt;<i> comply. For more granular, second generation state laws, look at what has been
</I>&gt;<i> passed in MA, MN, and NV in the last year or so; there's lots more detail 
</I>&gt;<i> about safeguards and requirements; NV's goes as far as to mandate an approach
</I>&gt;<i> modeled on PCI-DSS for personal information. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My expectation is that the safeguards listed in section 622 are going to
</I>&gt;<i> get argued in court as due care issues; you should be able to demonstrate 
</I>&gt;<i> that with evidence of comliance to GLBA or HIPAA, as stated. Any of PCI-DSS,
</I>&gt;<i> ISO, NIST, COBIT, ITIL... or a solid InfoSec program or your own creation
</I>&gt;<i> could also suffice. It will be a up to lawyers and expert witnesses
</I>&gt;<i> to argue whether 622 is met or not when this gets applied to a breach.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's one example where the statute was used to coerce a settlement:

</I>&gt;<i> I'm not aware of much else generating press on this statute.
