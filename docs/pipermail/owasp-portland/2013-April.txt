Hi Everyone,

I've recently accepted a new position in the Seattle area and will be
relocating at the end of April. There will be an opening for a application
security engineer at Nike shortly to replace me. If any of you are
interested or know of someone who is, please have them forward their resume
to me and I'll pass it along to the hiring manager.

Thanks!

--Matt

I finally got around to tallying up all of the votes for Jim's talks.
Top 10 web defense was most asked for, with SDLC coming in a close
second.  I'm giving Jim the choice on which.

Thank you everyone who offered their opinion.  Sorry for being bossy.
