The OWAP Portland Chapter is hosting its 2nd annual Training Day on October 4th . The Training Day 2016 was a huge success and so, we have expanded the event to 6 sessions adding some intriguing topics such as Incidence Response.Yet, they are still affordable at the last year?s price of $25 each. Check out our Training Day 2017 program at:
