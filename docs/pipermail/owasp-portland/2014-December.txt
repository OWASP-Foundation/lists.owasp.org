*Presentation - **Combating the Insider Threat*

Malicious attacks are up 87% over last year and insider threats still
remain as the leading cause of Data Breaches and IT sabotage.  The threat
is real, enough so that Federal agencies and Federal systems integrators
were required by Executive Order #13587 to implement an ?Insider Threat
Detection and Prevention Program? by the end of 2013.  Yet traditional
Defense-in-depth methods fall flat to address the ever-present risk
inherent to unstructured data management.  Come learn what industry trends
as well as recent research from the FBI can teach us about securing our
security ?soft center?.



Terry Boedeker, Solutions Engineer, Varonis Systems, has over 15 years of
experience in Information Technology ranging from software development,
technical writing, managed services and data center operations, to business
continuity program management, and information security.  He proudly served
in the United States Marines from 2003 to 2007, and graduated summe cum
laude from DeVry University in 2012, earning a B.S. in Networks &
Communications Management.  He joined Varonis Systems in 2013, and
maintains the Certified Information Systems Security Professional
certification from (ISC)2.  For more details, visit

I have a Mentor course coming up this spring and I invite you to join.

The course is the SANS Training Program for CISSP Certification. It is a
10 week mentored self-study. We will meet once per week to discuss the
security domains, go over any difficult topics and ask questions in a
small group.

The overall goal is to provide all the information enabling you to pass
the CISSP exam.

I am a 20 year veteran in IT and currently an Information Security
Architect for the City of Portland. I studied and passed my CISSP exam
in the spring of 2014.

Here is the link for the course. When you register, please put my name
in as a referral, under the "how did you hear about this event":
http://www.sans.org/instructors/brian-ventura [1]

If you have questions, please feel free to email me directly.

Look forward to seeing you at the next meeting.

Thank you.
