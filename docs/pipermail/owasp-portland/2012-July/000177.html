Yes, although I don't do a lot of development these days.

I'd say make it their priority. It should be added cred for them having a CISSP
on staff; maybe nobody ever asks them about their security credentials? 
Or, do it for yourself. Every job I've held in the last dozen years or so
has either required or desired it.

Depending on your background, self-study should not consume a huge amount of
time, and I recommend that route - the prep courses are expensive and cover
what I'd consider the basics, if you have a few years of real experience.
If the test is offered again locally some time a ways out, there's likely to be a study group leading up to it you could join.

} Do OWASP meetings offer credit?

You can claim credit for chapter meetings as long as there's a security topic discussed - so ISACA and ISSA meetings locally would count, too.
