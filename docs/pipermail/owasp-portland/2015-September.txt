Subject: [Owasp-portland] Planning Meeting, October 7th @6:30pm
Message-ID: <20150924212641.GE1175@sentinelchicken.org>



Hi folks,

We're having our annual planning meeting on Wednesday, October 7.  We
haven't picked a venue yet, but I expect it will be at a restaurant
downtown.  If you're interested in helping our chapter out, have ideas
for OWASP events, or just want to learn more about how the chapter
works, come join us.

Please email me privately if you plan on coming so I can get a head
count.  More info here:

Thanks!
tim
