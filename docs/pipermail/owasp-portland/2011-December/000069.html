</I>&gt;<i> A) Business in the Cloud: Mitigating Risk
</I>&gt;<i> =========================================
</I>&gt;<i> The cloud is a fundamental paradigm shift from our current or past
</I>&gt;<i> thinking about scalable architecture and security. It&#8217;s a cost-effective
</I>&gt;<i> way to provide maximum mobility and accessibility for your customers,
</I>&gt;<i> but there are security tradeoffs: less control of data, new
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerability classes, and compliance challenges. However, if managed
</I>&gt;<i> properly, these risks can be mitigated.  This presentation will discuss
</I>&gt;<i> the challenges of cloud computing, demonstrate how to build a secure and
</I>&gt;<i> redundant system, and touch upon real-world examples of cloud computing
</I>&gt;<i> gone bad. Topics include:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Pros and cons of cloud computing
</I>&gt;<i> * Trust - is it there when you need it to be? Amazon case study
</I>&gt;<i> * Security controls
</I>&gt;<i> * Securing applications in the cloud
</I>&gt;<i> * Redundancy - yes, we still need to think about it. Netflix case study
</I>&gt;<i> * The murky waters of compliance: PCI, GLBA, SAS 70, HIPAA, etc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> B) Attacker Techniques: Uncut &amp; Uncensored
</I>&gt;<i> ==========================================
</I>&gt;<i> The security decisions made in each phase software development have a
</I>&gt;<i> cascading effect (both positive and negative) in subsequent phases. And
</I>&gt;<i> those decisions can make it a lot easier or harder for an attacker to
</I>&gt;<i> penetrate security measure.  This interactive session, hosted by a
</I>&gt;<i> software security expert, will shed light on today&#8217;s most pervasive
</I>&gt;<i> security flaws like injection and overflows - and the ease with which
</I>&gt;<i> they can be exploited, as seen in the recent attacks against Sony
</I>&gt;<i> PlayStation Network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using automated tools, manual techniques, and software applications
</I>&gt;<i> custom-built for this demonstration, the host will show how an attacker
</I>&gt;<i> views an application, looks for clues and vulnerabilities, and
</I>&gt;<i> ultimately exploits these weaknesses For each attack scenario, he will
</I>&gt;<i> discuss the underlying flaw, exploit, vulnerability and consequence, and
</I>&gt;<i> encourage attendee participation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> C) Security Debate: Source Code Scanning or Web Application Scanning?
</I>&gt;<i> =====================================================================
</I>&gt;<i> Source code reviews are helpful in finding many known dangerous
</I>&gt;<i> functions and structures in code. Web scanning provides insight into
</I>&gt;<i> as-deployed Web applications. Individually, each technique provides a
</I>&gt;<i> unique and targeted window into true security, but combining the two can
</I>&gt;<i> yield amazing results. This presentation will describe the process of
</I>&gt;<i> synergistically using tools like source code scanners along with web
</I>&gt;<i> application scanners to dramatically reduce costs and harden your web
</I>&gt;<i> applications
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Topics covered:
</I>&gt;<i> * When should testing be done: during development or post-deployment?
</I>&gt;<i> * Automated vs. manual efforts &#8211; each has its time and place, but what
</I>&gt;<i> is the optimal mix?
</I>&gt;<i> * Debate: the pros and cons of black box vs. white box testing
</I>&gt;<i> * Best practices for source code scanning and web application scanning
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> D) Fragile Relics: Securing Legacy Applications
</I>&gt;<i> ===============================================
</I>&gt;<i> Legacy applications are often like Wonders of the Ancient World - nobody
</I>&gt;<i> can quite explain how exactly they came to be ... and surely nobody
</I>&gt;<i> knows how to secure them properly. And a lot of legacy applications are
</I>&gt;<i> rewritten or re-wrapped in new code in attempts to improve
</I>&gt;<i> interoperability and functionality. New platforms like Service-Oriented
</I>&gt;<i> Architectures (SOA) and development techniques like AJAX presents a
</I>&gt;<i> great opportunity to give a fresh look to the application development
</I>&gt;<i> and management process of legacy applications and introduce
</I>&gt;<i> security-specific principles early in the process. This talk will guide
</I>&gt;<i> you through best practices in making mission-critical legacy
</I>&gt;<i> applications secure using today's latest techniques and technologies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This talk will walk through several business cases of companies who
</I>&gt;<i> built service-oriented architectures using the latest tools and methods
</I>&gt;<i> with a specific mind toward securing their mission-critical legacy
</I>&gt;<i> applications in the process. We will discuss their decision processes
</I>&gt;<i> and analyze their choices of SOA, encryption, outsourcing,
</I>&gt;<i> authentication, threat modeling, and SDLC best practices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> E) Finding your Inner Evildoer for Successful Security Testing
</I>&gt;<i> ==============================================================
</I>&gt;<i> Typically, a seasoned tester that can hunt down functional bugs in the
</I>&gt;<i> oddest of places does not make the transition to security testing very
</I>&gt;<i> easily. This presentation will discuss the three tenants of a great
</I>&gt;<i> security tester: Hearing Evil, Seeing Evil, and Doing Evil:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Hearing Evil - the ability to absorb a massive amount of security
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge and immediately and effectively apply it to their daily
</I>&gt;<i> testing lives. Testers with this ability can draw upon years of
</I>&gt;<i> experience and testing history to detect when things are out of place or
</I>&gt;<i> where the deep interesting security bugs reside.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Seeing evil - visualizing the system in the mind&#8217;s eye. Any great
</I>&gt;<i> security tester can use his or her imagination to visualize what is
</I>&gt;<i> occurring in the various components of a system that we do not have
</I>&gt;<i> access to. This imagination leads to deep understanding of how the
</I>&gt;<i> system is structured and allows the tester to visualize opportunities
</I>&gt;<i> for exploitation well below the surface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Doing evil - the ability for a security tester to figure out ways to
</I>&gt;<i> replicate an attacker&#8217;s master plan and execute on it themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> Thinking like an attacker isn&#8217;t enough - fully securing a system or
</I>&gt;<i> application requires surgical execution of a master attack plan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> F) I'm the Optimist
</I>&gt;<i> ===================
</I>&gt;<i> Despite nearly every metric by which we can measure the overall security
</I>&gt;<i> as an industry we're getting worse. How can we continue to feel good
</I>&gt;<i> about software in general. Talk about CAs, SSL, DNSSEC, etc., security
</I>&gt;<i> bug trends, disclosure, large scales software and small scale software,
</I>&gt;<i> and privacy. For each of these things talk about how developers need to
</I>&gt;<i> step up, but it's not an insurmountable problem.
