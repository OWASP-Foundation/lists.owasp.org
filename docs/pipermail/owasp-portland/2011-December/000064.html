<PRE>Hi Matthew,


&gt;<i> Thanks to those of you who showed up for the meeting last week. How about
</I>&gt;<i> for our next meeting, we get together at Hopworks Urban Brewery on SE
</I>&gt;<i> Powell towards the end of January. We can discuss what we'd like 2012 to
</I>&gt;<i> look like, how often we'd like to meet and where is it most convenient for
</I>&gt;<i> people to meet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me know what you think.
</I>
Sure, I'd be up for a meeting toward the end of January.

As for the venue, I'm fine with that location as well, but have you
discussed this with Hopworks at all?  I think generally for more
official gatherings most restaurants like to have a head's up.

In the past, local groups like the PLUG have been able to get
restaurants to provide free private rooms on a monthly basis, presumably
on their less busy nights.  They've managed to get AV equipment set up
and everything (though I think they probably brought some of their own).
 I'm not sure how difficult that would be to do, finding a venue with a
private room... Any thoughts on that for the future?
