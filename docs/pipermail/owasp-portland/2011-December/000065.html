<PRE>That's a good point Timothy,

I wasn't thinking of this as a formal meeting, just an informal get
together. I was going to see about interest and then contact Hopworks about
maybe getting a room or at least several tables pulled together. If that
doesn't work out, I'll find someplace that can accommodate us.

For a formal meeting where we have a speaker coming in, that sounds like a
great idea though!

Thanks for the feedback.

Matthew

&gt;<i> Hi Matthew,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks to those of you who showed up for the meeting last week. How about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for our next meeting, we get together at Hopworks Urban Brewery on SE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Powell towards the end of January. We can discuss what we'd like 2012 to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; look like, how often we'd like to meet and where is it most convenient
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people to meet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let me know what you think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, I'd be up for a meeting toward the end of January.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the venue, I'm fine with that location as well, but have you
</I>&gt;<i> discussed this with Hopworks at all?  I think generally for more
</I>&gt;<i> official gatherings most restaurants like to have a head's up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the past, local groups like the PLUG have been able to get
</I>&gt;<i> restaurants to provide free private rooms on a monthly basis, presumably
</I>&gt;<i> on their less busy nights.  They've managed to get AV equipment set up
</I>&gt;<i> and everything (though I think they probably brought some of their own).
</I>&gt;<i>  I'm not sure how difficult that would be to do, finding a venue with a
</I>&gt;<i> private room... Any thoughts on that for the future?
