Hello Everyone,



I wanted to take a moment and introduce myself. My name is Matthew
Lapworth. I?m a security practitioner in the Beaverton area focusing on web
application security. I?ve held my CISSP for about a year and a half and
been an OWASP member for about a year.



Are there any planned meetings coming up? I didn?t see anything on the
chapter page.



Thanks,

Matthew

Welcome Matthew!

Hi Wes, everyone:

Actually, we have had 2 meetings!

AJ and I have had a heck of a time finding people who are interested in
speaking or leading discussions.  In our recent discussions, we were
hoping to line up at least 3 speakers and then begin holding meetings
quarterly, in the hope that would give us enough time to start filling
the queue with more topics/speakers.

We would love it if people wanted to help out with herding speakers or
have things they want to hold a meeting on.  There's no requirement that
speakers have any kind of formal slides or presentation materials.  A
white board and some passion about a topic for discussion is all that's
needed.

It would probably help if we can get some discussions started here on
the mailing list about various application security topics that interest
folks.  That may lead to people coming up with more specific items they
want to discuss or present in person.

Let us know if you have other ideas for getting the chapter going again.

I've been wondering if this list was active.  Nice to see that there are
others out there.  I'd be interesting in meeting as well.  As for
topics, there have been quite a few public websites hacked recently.
I'd be interested in learning how they were pulled off and what we can
do to prevent similar issues.

I would be interesting in getting together and talking about the latest
breaches and what can be learned from them.

Another good topic I would like to discuss is to hear if anyone has
introduced secure coding guidelines leveraging OWASP's top 10 into a very
dynamic development environment.
