anti-virus software and will invite attendees to join the discussion.

Hi, all, thanks for the fun debate last night. There were some great points made. Would it be possible to share the slides that were presented? I'm very keen on hearing all of the concerns that people have on security products as it's my job to strive to make them better.

Hi Hiep and Scott,

Here are the slides I used for my portion.  I don't have Tony's
updated slides so I'll let him respond with those.


Hiep:

Thanks for your perspective last night.  I know my argments cut
against security dogma and while I feel strongly that we need to
reexamine our use of many security products, I do want to attenuate my
assertions a little bit by saying this:  

If a security vendor adopts a strong "do no harm" ethic and policies,
implementing these by designing their own product to be very secure,
use the latest mitigation tools (compiler options, sandboxing) along
with regular security audits (code reviews, automated fuzzing, etc),
then I can see a place for these kind of products.  Currently, that's
*not* how most security products are developed (besides the examples I
gave, I've tested plenty of security products over the years and many
are awful).  I'm also skeptical that securely written security products
can survive in the market place, given the state of the industry, but
it is something we should strive for!

Best regards,
tim

Hi again,

As a quick follow up, some data on what AV exploits might fetch in the
grey market:
  https://zerodium.com/program.html

They list up to $40,000 for remote code execution or local privilege
escalation for AV bugs.  That's for a fully working push-button
exploit. Suppose a talented person requires a full month of testing to
find one RCE.  Then spends another month of work to develop a
weaponized exploit.  That's still a healthy annual paycheck
(~$240000), and I know a number of researchers that now work
exclusively on bug bounties like this.  This may be a reason we don't
hear about a lot more vulnerabilities these days.  Of course many bugs
don't require nearly that much time for exploit development and
Tavis/Joxean found many more than that with much less search time.

Tim, I hear you loud and clear and I wholeheartedly agree with you. I no longer work for McAfee so I cannot speak on their behalf anymore, but I can say this...  Ryan Permeh (founder of Cylance) and I worked together at McAfee. He was in charge of product security and conducted security audits on all their products while I ran global malware research. I joined him at Cylance because they are taking a different approach to security. I (like Ryan and Stuart McClure) was disenfranchised with the dogma of security (as you put it so well). Here are a few things that Cylance is doing differently that I hope addresses your exact concerns:

1. Attached is a document written by Ryan saying exactly the same things that you pointed out
2. Cylance is working with HackerOn and has an active Bug bounty program.  So if you find something, we want to know about it PLUS you can make some money
3. We do continuous security scanning of our product via WhiteHat Sentinel.
4. We do quarterly security audits via Optiv.
5. We do quarterly agent security audits via AttackResearch.

- Hiep
