Thanks James for the insight.

I know the moment has sort of passed on this discussion, but I'll
throw a few of my own opinions out there.

I do penetration testing and vulnerability assessments regularly.
It's probably 80+ percent of what I spend my work time on.  I do both
application penetration tests and more traditional network penetration
tests and vulnerability assessments.

I think this is a very good way to look at it.  There is indeed a lot
of confusion out there (mostly created by people trying to make what
they're selling sound better than it is) about what a vulnerability
assessment is and what a penetration test entails.  This is also a
frustration of mine, and I'm glad to see you draw the line between the
two in much the same way I would.

There are a lot of relatively inexperienced consultants out there
providing vulnerability assessments.  To add to this confusion, many
large consulting firms subcontract to smaller companies to provide the
technical muscle.  While this may often work out fine (I work for such
a smaller company), it's hard to know if from project to project
where you'll receive consultants from.  (I guess that's true even if
there is no subcontracting going on.)  I think for all of these
reasons, it's useful to get as much information as you can about who
will be delivering the work.

While the risk of untrustworthy pentesters always exists, I don't
think it's all that significant.  I think in the 90's, companies were
much more receptive to the idea of taking some hacker kid and turning
him around to the "good side", but the honeymoon is long over on that
idea.  (Just take a look at Mitnick's saga.)  So if a pentester has a
shady background, they're either hiding it really well (as could any
employee), or they're having a hard time finding work.  I would guess
a "smart shady" character wouldn't want to risk blowing their cover by
actually doing evil things to systems they were already testing, but
then I guess there's a level of irrationality there too...

When I first started penetration testing, I was somewhat surprised by
how much I was encouraged to fully exploit certain flaws, rather than
just note them and provide recommendations to fix them.  However, over
time I began to realize that fully exploiting problems does have a
number of benefits.  

Obviously for the consultant, there's a "wow factor" that goes along
with breaking into something.  It helps prove our competence, but yes,
it can easily turn into a trophy hunt.  However, wow factor can be
useful for our clients too.  If critical data was accessed, this may
help get funds allocated more toward security within the organization.

Another, perhaps more important, benefit is to fully understand the
issue and the difficulty of exploiting it.  Perhaps on the surface a
particular bug looks easy to exploit, but 5 hours later, you realize
it's tough to do in practice and you can perhaps reduce it's severity.

The same goes the other way... I've been noticing an unpublished bug
in a popular piece of commercial software for a few years now that I
considered potentially serious, but probably not easily exploitable.
I finally got around to fully exploiting it last week and realized
that it's really bad and not that hard to exploit.  Most customers
wouldn't have expected me to go the extra mile and exploit this flaw,
given our typical engagement parameters, but now do I feel stupid for
not trying a little harder earlier.  Well, at least I can go back
through my old reports and notify all of my customers about how to
better prioritize it.  

In many cases though, especially in traditional network-level tests,
that doing full penetration testing often doesn't add a great deal of
value.  On the application side, the automated tools work far less
well and you're regularly coming across flaws which are novel and hard
to assess, so exploiting them there has a lot more value.

I agree you definitely do not want an adversarial relationship with IT
staff.  In addition, I rarely see any benefit in doing blind
penetration tests.  Typically we work pretty closely with IT staff to
arrange testing, but occasionally we get customers who feel that it
isn't a "good test" of their environment if we're given any
information about it.  Usually those customers are just wasting my
time and their money.  Chances are there are much better things to be
spending scarce security funds on than playing war games.  I can
provide a lot more benefit if you show me how things are roughly put
together first.  Yes, that gives me an advantage over an attacker, but
only by a day or two of recon.

If you got this far, thanks for reading. =)

I'd like to give more OWASP talks, but I'm not sure what folks are
most interested in.  Here are a few ideas I had:

Breaking Cryptography in Practice

This would cover how cryptography is commonly used in custom
applications, what mistakes are often made and how to exploit these
conditions.



Why You Should Place All of Your Websites Under HTTPS

Here I would cover two serious recent threats to web security:
HTML/HTTP/SSL downgrade attacks (a.k.a sslstrip attacks) and DNS
rebinding.



Short Series on Browser Security

I thought it might be fun to give a series of short talks (read: with
few slides/materials) on browser security which would cover some or
all of the following topics:

- Same-origin policy (SOP) basics

- Cross-site scripting (a.k.a. A decade of SOP bypass)

- Cross-site request forgery (a.k.a. how SOP is broken to begin with)

- DNS rebinding (a.k.a. Not your Momma's SOP bypass)

- Click-jacking (a.k.a. the GUI is not your friend)

- Overview of attacks on browsers

- Writing secure Java Web Start applications



Let me know what you're most interested in and I'll try to get a few
presentations put together.

I like your ideas.  Some more off the top of my head:

- HTML 5 vulnerabilities and/or surface area.  Video/Audio/Canvas
aside, seems like there is room for some discussion about data
attributes, local storage, offline apps, geolocation, etc.

- Pros and Cons of CSP (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/CSP)

- Threats and exploits using Unicode.  The O'Reilly book on Unicode is
700 pages long and I think I've met 2 people in my life that fully
understand Unicode and encoding.  This area seems ripe for abuse.

- Logging best practices, both in the app and on the backend
(aggregation, storage, analysis)

- Vulnerabilities we can expect due to the rise of mobile devices.
I'm not sure there is a presentation here, but something to think
about:  alternate views of data for the small screens, alternate
routes onto a network, complete trust in app stores, etc.

I'm definitely interested in hearing more about HTML 5 security.

This would also be awesome to hear more about.  I've personally become
more interested in how HTTP/HTML/browser/etc standards can address
broad categories of issues.

Hah, you've met 2?  I haven't met any, though I've hand to wrestle
with it a bit now and again, and enjoy UTF-7 XSS. =)

All of these are great ideas.  Would you like to present on some of
them?

A note to everyone: we don't necessarily need a polished formal
presentation from you to come and start a discussion on a topic.  A
handful of slides (or a sketch on a white board) along with a topic
you're passionate about is more than enough to get us thinking.
Think of it as play Discussion Leader.

We clearly haven't had a strong start to getting regular meetings
going, and it's primarily because we've had a heck of a time getting
folks to commit to speaking.  I plan on jumping in more when I can,
but I think everyone will start to get kind of sick of listening to me
after a while.

Ha, I see what you did there. ;)  I'm familiar with them, but not
necessarily from a security standpoint - at least not from a high
level standpoint.  The most interesting thing I could talk about on
the list is CSP, but it won't be anything you don't know if you've
read the wiki pages on it.

I'll try to come up with some topics that I have more experience with.

Well heck, if the bar is so low I'll throw my hat in the ring. I get
fired up about:
- threat modeling
- Chicken Little syndrome
- authentication
- *useful* distinctions in crypto-land
- the overuse of firewalls, IDS and NAT

I'm sure no one here's ever heard of me, so a little intro is in
order: I've done security consulting as a blue badge for both
Microsoft and Intel (my current employer), and while I started out my
career as an infrastructure security guy, I'm pretty heavily into the
design side of SDL now.  I've got plenty of opinions (and a few of 'em
may be worthwhile), and I monkey around with a few .NET code projects
on Codeplex.

Happy to help get some momentum going, especially if there are a few
willing zealots in the room to banter back & forth on a hot button
issue with me.

Oh, and BTW I'm Canadian (and insufferably vocal about it).

Cheers,
Mike Lonergan

We definitely don't want to give the impression that speakers need to
come up with conference-level talks or training to get a discussion
going in our meetings.  If it's something you're fired up about,
you're halfway there.  Persuasive talks are great for getting people
thinking about issues.

As for your list above, I'd personally be most interested in
authentication and to find out what you mean by "*useful* distinctions
in crypto-land".

Nice to meet you.  I'm sure you'll find a zealot or two to banter with
in our group.  At a minimum, there's me. ;-)

Let us know if/when you'd be interested in giving a talk and what your
first topic would be.

Ok, unless there's any other opinions from list members, I'll set
aside some time to get that talk put together.

Well I think if you wanted to start by presenting the issues
surrounding same-origin policy and and XSS and then lead into the CSP
effort, that's plenty for one talk.  While the SOP has been around for
a long time, I think a lot of people still aren't familiar with the
details, particularly when you start talking about cookies, flash,
Java applets, etc...

Then again, if covering SOP doesn't get you fired up, then I'll keep
it on my list of things to cover down the road.

I look forward to it.

Thanks,
tim

Indeed, even further than this, if the goal is to get the group discussing
with each member participating, it would be a benefit to have a speaker that
is ... not a great speaker :)

Subject: [Owasp-portland] DFRWS 2010 in Portland
Message-ID: <20100526011059.GX2031@sentinelchicken.org>


Hello all,

This is slightly off topic, but near and dear to my heart, so I just
wanted to share.  Hope you don't mind.

DFRWS is a research-oriented digital forensics conference which brings
together academics, corporate incident responders, and law enforcement
to discuss the latest research in the field.  In my opinion it is one
of the better digital forensics conferences in the US.

DFRWS 2010 will be held right here in Portland on August 2-4.  You can
find out more here:
  http://www.dfrws.org/
  
Some of the reasons I personally enjoy the conference and keep
attending each year:

- It is small.  Some of the most well known computer forensics
  researchers attend each year, and with a headcount of just about
  100, it is easy to rub elbows with some sharp folks.

- It is affordable.  Since the conference isn't training-oriented,
  prices are quite reasonable when comparing it to other forensics
  conferences.  For this reason it's also a great conference for
  students to get their feet wet in a niche computer discipline.
  Please forward this along to any local students you know who might
  be interested.

- An open source flavor.  I'm a fan of open source and many of the
  attendees at the conference regularly release open source tools.


If you register before the 1st of June, you'll save yourself $75.

Cheers,
tim
