*When: *

Thursday, November 21, 2013 from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM (PST) - Doors open at
11:30 AM





 *Location:  *

Con-Way

2055 Northwest Savier Street

Portland, OR 97209





*What:*

Security consultant Jared Pfost with Caliber Security will present on &#8220;*Why
and how to build an application security metrics program&#8221;*.



We&#8217;ll share a case study constructing a metrics program for secure software
development. We&#8217;ll provide examples to help answer:

    - Why measure security in development?

    - What do we measure?

    - What does success look like?

    - What's defferent in agile vs waterfall?



 We&#8217;ll also provide examples how to communicate performance data,
incorporate feedback loops, and ultimately help leadership improve their
cost-benefit decisions on security investments. The result of the session
will be a set of specific tasks to measure security and a process to decide
if you should do them.





*Who:*

Jared Pfost brings nearly 18 years of information security experience to
Caliber Security Partners. Jared's unique career combines working in IT
Security teams and consulting with designing and shipping security software
in startups and at Microsoft. Jared is a self-proclaimed process nut and
has demonstrated you don't need unlimited resources to run a measurable,
accountable, and effective security shop. Jared previously founded Third
Defense (acquired by Caliber Security Partners), worked at Washington
Mutual managing the security architecture, business security officers, and
risk management teams. Previous experiences include VP Product Development
&amp; Strategy at BioPassword, 6 years at Microsoft in audit, information
security, and program management roles. During the bubble years Jared was a
Program Manager at Asta Networks and way back a consultant for Arthur
Andersen. Jared holds a bachelors in information systems and finance from
the University of Washington.
