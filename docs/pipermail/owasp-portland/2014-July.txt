Hi OWASP friends,

after Cascadia JS (7/31 - 8/1), myself and Brad Hill are putting on a Test
The Web Forward event the Sunday of the following weekend, August 3rd :

"Serious front-end developers know that security is not just for
server-side code anymore. Come learn how Content Security Policy works to
help stop XSS in your apps. Then learn to write tests that will help you
explore CSP, make it better and more interoperable, and perhaps even find a
bypass we haven't thought of yet."

More details are at http://testthewebforward.org/events/2014/portland.html

If you're interested in CSP and want to get involved in helping making it
happen, this is a great way to get started !

cheers,
ian

Hello all!

New to the group and field! Would this event have any benefit for newbies who are not able to hand code HTML, JavaScript and CSS or would this be too way over my head? If so are there any other events or meetings upcoming that I could attend to observe and learn from others in the field? Thanks for any responses!

Hi Kirk,

you pretty much would need to be able to hand code HTML, JavaScript and CSS
to participate.

there's a Portland OWASP chapter meeting coming up
http://calagator.org/events/1250466289 which
is open to everyone - i'm not sure yet what the topic will be

cheers,
ian

Subject: [Owasp-portland] OWASP Chapter Meeting - July 22
Message-ID: <20140719031151.GO1043@sentinelchicken.org>


Hi OWASPers,

We had a speaker lined up for Tuesday, but something came up and he
can't make it.  So I'll be filling in and speaking on the XML external
entities attack research I presented at AppSecUSA last year.  It's
slightly dated, but if you aren't familiar with this class of
vulnerability, it should be enlightening.

I think we're still looking to fill a slot or two more for speakers
this year, so if you have any ideas or know anyone who would be
interested, please send them our way. 

The meeting info is here:
  http://calagator.org/events/1250466289

Cheers,
tim
