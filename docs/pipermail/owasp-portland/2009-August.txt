Subject: [Owasp-portland] Reminder: OWASP Meeting 08/12 @ 03:30PST
Message-ID: <648221400908101030wcaa53edte0d3ad24761bc5eb@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Just a reminder. The OWASP Portland Meeting will be held at the US Bank
Tower Plaza building 08/12 @ 03:30-04:30PM. Ask the attendant at the front
desk for directions, or even better give me a call when you arrive. I've
included the address below, as well as my contact information.

I haven't heard back from most of you so I'm not sure what kind of head
count to expect. If enough of you can't make it please let me know promptly
and I'll try to reschedule.

Thanks,
AJ Dexter
801-372-9378

Title: Portland OWASP Meeting
Time: Wed Sep 30 15:30 ? 16:30 (Timezone: Pacific Time)
Where: US Bank Tower Plaza 111SW 5th Avenue, Portland, OR
Calendar: owasp-portland at lists.owasp.org
Owner/Creator: aj.dexter at gmail.com

Description: All,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry for those that couldn't make  
it to the 1st meeting on the 12th, that seems likely the result of an  
emailing error on my part. It was pretty productive for organizing the  
future of the chapter. Didn't learn a blasted thing about Web Application  
Security. Fortunately the wrinkles are getting ironed out, and I've got  
some assistance from Tim Morgan for future events so we can ramp up the  
knowledge. Below you'll find the information for the next scheduled  
meeting. If you have any questions let me know. I'll send out speaker or  
discussion topic information as soon as I can.Date: September 30th,  
2009Time: 03:30PM - 04:30PM PST Location: US Bank Tower Plaza 111SW 5th  
Avenue, Portland, OR.Thanks,AJ Dexter801-372-9378
