<PRE>Well heck, if the bar is so low I'll throw my hat in the ring. I get
fired up about:
- threat modeling
- Chicken Little syndrome
- authentication
- *useful* distinctions in crypto-land
- the overuse of firewalls, IDS and NAT

I'm sure no one here's ever heard of me, so a little intro is in
order: I've done security consulting as a blue badge for both
Microsoft and Intel (my current employer), and while I started out my
career as an infrastructure security guy, I'm pretty heavily into the
design side of SDL now.  I've got plenty of opinions (and a few of 'em
may be worthwhile), and I monkey around with a few .NET code projects
on Codeplex.

Happy to help get some momentum going, especially if there are a few
willing zealots in the room to banter back &amp; forth on a hot button
issue with me.

Oh, and BTW I'm Canadian (and insufferably vocal about it).

Cheers,
Mike Lonergan

&gt;<i> Hey Wil,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I like your ideas.  Some more off the top of my head:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good.  Do any of the items on my list stand out as ones you'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> hear about first?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - HTML 5 vulnerabilities and/or surface area.  Video/Audio/Canvas
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aside, seems like there is room for some discussion about data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attributes, local storage, offline apps, geolocation, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm definitely interested in hearing more about HTML 5 security.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Pros and Cons of CSP (<A HREF="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/CSP">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/CSP</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would also be awesome to hear more about.  I've personally become
</I>&gt;<i> more interested in how HTTP/HTML/browser/etc standards can address
</I>&gt;<i> broad categories of issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Threats and exploits using Unicode.  The O'Reilly book on Unicode
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 700 pages long and I think I've met 2 people in my life that fully
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand Unicode and encoding.  This area seems ripe for abuse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hah, you've met 2?  I haven't met any, though I've hand to wrestle
</I>&gt;<i> with it a bit now and again, and enjoy UTF-7 XSS. =)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Logging best practices, both in the app and on the backend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (aggregation, storage, analysis)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Vulnerabilities we can expect due to the rise of mobile devices.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure there is a presentation here, but something to think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about:  alternate views of data for the small screens, alternate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> routes onto a network, complete trust in app stores, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of these are great ideas.  Would you like to present on some of
</I>&gt;<i> them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A note to everyone: we don't necessarily need a polished formal
</I>&gt;<i> presentation from you to come and start a discussion on a topic.  A
</I>&gt;<i> handful of slides (or a sketch on a white board) along with a topic
</I>&gt;<i> you're passionate about is more than enough to get us thinking.
</I>&gt;<i> Think of it as play Discussion Leader.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We clearly haven't had a strong start to getting regular meetings
</I>&gt;<i> going, and it's primarily because we've had a heck of a time getting
</I>&gt;<i> folks to commit to speaking.  I plan on jumping in more when I can,
</I>&gt;<i> but I think everyone will start to get kind of sick of listening to me
</I>&gt;<i> after a while.
