Subject: [OWASP-Portland] Training Day - Volunteers Needed
Message-ID: <20160613070246.69aa0e69@shannon.sentinelchicken.org>

Hi everyone,

We are trying to put together a local OWASP training day for sometime this
fall.  We tentatively expect to have four one-half day courses open to the
general public, and to make these courses very affordable for students.  
Our volunteer instructors consist of:

Joe FitzPatrick
Tim Morgan
Adam Russell
Brian Ventura

And Bhushan Gupta is currently helping us organize.

However, we will need more volunteers to make this a success.  Volunteer
activities will include helping with things like:

- Deciding on and reserving a venue
- Engaging with sponsors
- Acting as a helper for an instructor during class
- Setting up a possible happy hour event
- ...

Interested?  Please email me back privately.  We have another planning
meeting for this event on Friday evening (June 17) and I can provide details
once you email me.

Thanks!
tim
