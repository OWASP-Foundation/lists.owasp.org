</I>&gt;<i> Hello !
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> August's meeting is 8/9 at 6 pm. The speaker is Anna Lorimer @securitanna
</I>&gt;<i> presenting &quot;Security Internships: Bringing up the next generation of
</I>&gt;<i> hackers&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Software engineering internships are increasingly popular and are becoming
</I>&gt;<i> an integral part of career development for newcomers to the tech
</I>&gt;<i> scene.They&#8217;re also valuable to any organization because they give senior
</I>&gt;<i> engineers the opportunity to pass on knowledge and make it easier to find
</I>&gt;<i> full time hires down the road. While there&#8217;s plenty of information about
</I>&gt;<i> how to run a software engineering internship, the same can&#8217;t be said for
</I>&gt;<i> security internships. In this talk I&#8217;ll discuss how security internships
</I>&gt;<i> differ from regular software engineering internships, how to find interns,
</I>&gt;<i> and how to structure internships to set up both your organization and the
</I>&gt;<i> intern(s) for success.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bio:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anna Lorimer is an undergraduate student studying math and computer
</I>&gt;<i> science at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Canada. She&#8217;s done 5
</I>&gt;<i> internships over the course of her undergraduate career and is currently
</I>&gt;<i> doing her sixth with New Relic&#8217;s Product Security Team in Portland. She is
</I>&gt;<i> also the co-founder of StarCon, a technology conference focused on the joy
</I>&gt;<i> of technology and building a community around sharing technical knowledge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We'll be hosted by New Relic. More details here: <A HREF="http://calagator.org/">http://calagator.org/</A>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> September's meeting will be 9/18 at 6pm, hosted by @simple. The speaker
</I>&gt;<i> will be John L. Whiteman presenting &quot;SAST and the Bad Human Code Project&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> comparing static analysis tools and promoting a new project to help test
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Static application security testing (SAST) is the automated analysis of
</I>&gt;<i> source code both in its text and compiled forms. Lint is considered to be
</I>&gt;<i> one of the first tools to analyze source code and this year marks its 40th
</I>&gt;<i> anniversary. Even though it wasn't explicitly searching for security
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerabilities back then, it did flag suspicious constructs. Today there
</I>&gt;<i> are a myriad of tools to choose from both open source and commercial. We
</I>&gt;<i> did a comparative analysis of scanners specifically focused on web
</I>&gt;<i> application vulnerabilities. We then turned our attention to finding
</I>&gt;<i> additional ways to aggregate and correlate data from other sources such as
</I>&gt;<i> git logs, code complexity analyzers and even a roster of students who
</I>&gt;<i> completed a secure coding class. We wanted to go beyond just triaging in
</I>&gt;<i> isolation the vulnerable code snippets reported by the SAST scanners.
</I>&gt;<i> People write the code so why not use these added data features in an
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to build a predictive vulnerability model if possible. We are not
</I>&gt;<i> there yet but learned many things along the way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We also want to call attention to a new open source initiative called The
</I>&gt;<i> Bad Human Code Project. We need people to contribute intentionally
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerable code snippets in as many programming languages as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, we encourage folks to scan this project's repository and
</I>&gt;<i> upload the results so others can review them for their SAST needs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaker's Bio:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> John L. Whiteman is a web application security engineer at Oregon Health
</I>&gt;<i> and Science University. He builds security tools and teaches a hands-on
</I>&gt;<i> secure coding class to developers, researchers and anyone else interested
</I>&gt;<i> in protecting data at the institution. He previously worked as a security
</I>&gt;<i> researcher for Intel's Open Source Technology Center. John recently
</I>&gt;<i> completed a Master of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology
</I>&gt;<i> specializing in Interactive Intelligence. He loves talking with like-minded
</I>&gt;<i> people who are interested in building the next generation of security
</I>&gt;<i> controls using technologies such as machine learning and AI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More details on Training Day 2018 will be coming up soon! In addition to
</I>&gt;<i> adding a 4th track with 2 more classes, we also have a brand new awesome
</I>&gt;<i> venue for this year. We can't wait to show you the amazing classes we have
</I>&gt;<i> lined up this year. You can take a look at last year's info here:
