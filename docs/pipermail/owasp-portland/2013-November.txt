Con-Way

*What:*

Security consultant Jared Pfost with Caliber Security will present on ?*Why
and how to build an application security metrics program?*.



We?ll share a case study constructing a metrics program for secure software
development. We?ll provide examples to help answer:

    - Why measure security in development?

    - What do we measure?

    - What does success look like?

    - What's defferent in agile vs waterfall?



 We?ll also provide examples how to communicate performance data,
incorporate feedback loops, and ultimately help leadership improve their
cost-benefit decisions on security investments. The result of the session
will be a set of specific tasks to measure security and a process to decide
if you should do them.

Caliber Security Partners. Jared's unique career combines working in IT
Security teams and consulting with designing and shipping security software
in startups and at Microsoft. Jared is a self-proclaimed process nut and

Greetings!

The Portland OWASP chapter is seeking presenters and discussion leaders
for our chapter meetings in 2014.  Just about any security topic is
potentially fair game, but here are a few suggestions of the types of
things we would like:

* Any technical talks on specific classes of vulnerabilities
  (OWASP top 10 or similar)

* Your experiences in trying to apply OWASP principles in the real
  world

* Emerging threats or security risks associated with new technologies
  (HTML5, popular mobile paradigms, etc)

* Lead a discussion with the audience on controversial security topics

* Root cause analysis of why common development practices or platform
  constraints lead to software vulnerabilities


We hope to hold many more chapter meetings next year, so please don't
hesitate to submit your ideas.  Also, we could definitely use help in
spreading the word, so take a moment to think of anyone you know who
might be interested in speaking.

To submit a proposal, please email Tim and Adam the following:

* The title and abstract for each of the talk topics or discussions
  you are proposing.

* Your approximate calendar availability for 2014

* A short bio


Thank you!
