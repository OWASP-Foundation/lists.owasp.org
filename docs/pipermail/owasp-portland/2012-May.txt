Tim,

Both OpenDocMan and ResourceSpace sound sufficiently open to provide lots
of opportunities for security flaws. Since they are both targeted at small
business it would be helpful to the developers to  provide feedback. Unless
of course round two of the workshop will be coding fixes for the problems
discovered!

I'd be open to a longer session on the weekend but 2 hours in an evening is
also easy to arrage given some lead time.

Thanks,

Keith

I second Keith's suggestions. I think a longer 3-5 hours session on the
weekend would be more interesting as 2 hours can really fly when you're
heads down.  But what ever gets the most involvement is good with me.

My weekends are booked for the next few months. I'd be more inclined for longer evening sessions on weekdays (2-4hrs is fine) or maybe two nights in a row.

I was talking with Michael Coates today and he mentioned that he was
trying to get some security review and responsible pen-testing on
www.ushahidi.com 's project which is a young open source mapping
platform.  It sounded like a good opportunity for us since there
hasn't been a security review of their code before, they've asked for
help, it's a limited code size, and it's for an open source non-profit
company.  You can see an example at mozilla.crowdmap.com .

Michael wanted to coordinate a bit with Ushahidi first and also
offered to be available during our session via skype when we were
looking at the app.  I think it would be a good opportunity (Micheal
is the Chairman of the Board for OWASP and Director of Security
Assurance at Mozilla Corp).

I'm happy to work as coordinator between all of us if this project is
something we're interested in looking at.

Cheers,

Wil

That sounds like a great project for our first FLOSSHack. How soon were
they looking to start the review?

I asked if next week would be too soon and it sounds like that would
work fine.  By the time we figured out our schedule I imagine they'd
be good to go.

It looks like an excellent project to test and contribute to.  It is also great
that they are proactively seeking help with testing.  Thanks for bring this to
our attention Wil.

My only initial concern is that maybe their platform is quite solid and we might
have a hard time finding bugs.  Or the only bugs we'll find are esoteric and not
really the kind to help newbie auditors cut their teeth on.  Just don't want to
make it a frustrating experience.  I really have no idea what level of
experience our attendees will have, but I guess there's no way to know that
until we do our first one.

Anyway, I'm game to do Ushahidi first.  I think from a technical perspective,
the easiest way for us to ensure we get good access to an installation of the
application and exercise it's full features would be if the Ushahidi folks could
provide a preinstalled VM that is somehow set up to accept feeds from all of the
sources they support (within reason).  That way we'll have lots of potential
vectors to supply malicious data.

As for scheduling, I'm not in a huge rush.  I did want to try to have it this
month, but I want to make sure we have all the pieces in place first.  More on
that shortly...

I was actually looking forward to Resourcespace since I use that for our
business, but this sounds like another good opportunity I'd be open to
as well.

Hi David,

Catching up on your earlier email...

> Vote for Resourcespace. It fits your criteria.
> Moodle, wordpress, or joomla for future.

I liked your suggestion on Resourcespace since it seems like an active,
supported project but may not have had a ton of outside testing yet.  I'm not
sure about Moodle, but wordpress and joomla certainly have had more people
looking at them, so I'd be pretty hesitant to focus a first FLOSSHack on
something like that.  Sure, it would be awesome if we found 0days in something
as popular as wordpress, but I want to be sure people have plenty of
opportunities to walk before they run with app auditing.  Perhaps third-party
plugins for those applications would be easier targets though.

Yeah, I definitely do want to get back to Resourcespace, since it seems like a
good candidate.  Honestly, I thought it might be a better target from an
architectural perspective, but the possibility that Ushahidi's people might
actively help us get this going is a big attraction for me.

As we move forward with more of these, I one thing that would mean a lot to me
in terms of priorities, is if one of our members or a project's developers are
willing to help us set up the application test environment.  It can be a
significant investment in time trying to get an application set up for the first
time with all the bells and whistles that are worth testing, so if someone from
our group (or the app developer) volunteers to do that, then I'll probably be
sold on it. =)


Thanks,
tim

Hi again,

I don't personally have any real experience with providing remote video access
to events like this.  I've used video with Skype and Google video before, but
I'm not sure how well those kinds of things scale when lots of people want to
join and watch/listen in.  Also, let's suppose during our session one of our
remote users finds a good vulnerability and wants to present it to the group; in
that case what would be the easiest way to put them up on a projector to
describe the bug?  Just stream it to a laptop and hook it up?  I doubt video
quality would be ideal, but...

We don't necessarily have to get that fancy with it, but I think having
recordings of our hack session might go a long way towards advertising it for
future meetings.

Does anyone have experience with modern audio/video in this kind of setting?
Basically, I'm just hoping someone will *jump* at the chance to volunteer for
working out these details. ;-)

The idea of remote hacking sessions is a cool one, but we'd need access to
a decent amount of bandwidth if we want to have good video quality. I've
been doing a lot of travelling lately and Skype is barely tolerable on a
hotel internet connection or my LTE phone (low rez, lots of lag, etc...).

If we just want to record it, maybe someone has a bloggie or a couple of
camera's capable of taking digital video then we can gather some good
footage. I have some experience editing video together so I could probably
throw something together to promote the group.

Just a thought.

Google hangouts is actually really good about this kind of thing.
Skype would work too.  If we're doing this at Collective Agency the
bandwidth will be fine.

Getting screen sharing set up correctly is usually a headache, even
among people who teleconference regularly. :)

When they approached Michael for help he found a couple problems
(sounded like CSRF) and told them how to fix them but it sounds like
there is a lot of surface area left.  Aside from just finding actual
security holes, they aren't following recommendations like
implementing HTTPOnly flags and STS.  In the unlikely scenario we
didn't find anything we could talk about how to add those things to an
app and why they are important.

Regarding a test environment, you could download the open source
package or you could let them host the map stuff - the mozilla site I
linked to earlier is using their hosted option.  On the other hand, I
did a quick google search and found
https://github.com/ushahidi/virtual-machines which someone else
apparently already made :)

I'm downloading it over hotel wi-fi right now so it'll be a while
(500mb) but if no one else gets there first I'll send an update on how
it goes.

Cheers,

Wil

Download finished!  I had to tweak some settings to get the virtualbox
working on OS X (yay ipv6) but it wasn't anything too complex.  It
works as expected - I can load the site and poke around.  I just used
'ushahidi' as the password for everything and it worked - everything
else is in the README that comes with it and they have docs on their
website.

We should probably pull in the latest released code in the VM before
we start to play with it to make sure we're hitting the latest stuff.

Did anyone else try the VM?  Anyone have problems?  We could get
everyone trying to get the VM going this week (or next week), then a
week of playing, and then meet the week after?

If people aren't familiar with VMs this is a good chance to learn too.
 The package I linked to is just a virtualbox image (virtualbox is
free and cross platform - an excellent VM host).

Cheers,

Wil

Well, we need to work out the venue logistics first.  I still am not sure where
we will hold this meeting.  I definitely like Collective Agency, but it's not
free, so we'd either need to find a sponsor, or convince OWASP to fund it (need
to investigate that), or convince Collective Agency to let us do it for free,
since they sometimes support nonprofits in that way (under certain
arrangements).  FreeGeek is an option, but it is small and the scheduling is
tighter.  There's also the various public library options and I have leads on at
least one other location, but I need to find out whether or not these have good
Internet access.

The next step I planned on doing here was to try and figure out how many people
are going to come in person (which is always difficult, since a lot of people
fail to RSVP). If I expect there will be a lot planning on showing up, we may
need to rule out FreeGeek, for instance.  Right now it sounds like a 3-4 hour
weekend session is the preferred scenario.

Anyway, if anyone wants to help me research some of these things, I'd welcome
the assistance.

Great!  I was dreading having to set up VMWare on my linux box again.  It can be
so painful...

Collective Agency is investigating alternative memberships for small
groups of people right now.  I can give you updates on developments
there - probably next week or the week after.  I don't know about
freegeek.  Thanks for the logistics questions - definitely good next
steps. :)

Ok, great.  If you wouldn't mind following up on that to see if our chapter
could generally be added as a sponsored group, or whatever they call it, that
would be a big help.  Or, maybe just get special permission for this meeting
since we're doing it to help out Ushahidi; it might be hard for them to say no
to that.

No, I'm saying VMWare is still a bear to deal with on my Debian unstable
environment.  By comparison, VirtualBox is a dream.

There isn't a system in place for being a recurring sponsored group,
but the policies they are working on now would allow a member to
sponsor a meeting like this.  Let me get back to Portland (next week)
and sort some things out.

We should still figure out the rest of your questions - who is
interested, how many, date/time, etc.

Thanks,

Wil

Scheduling aside we do have multiple spaces that can be used if the rest
of the building is not open -- We hosted the Ubuntu Global Jam and fit
in upwards of 40 people.

I purchased it before doing my first Web Application Pen Test in February
and found it to be super useful.  Lots of up-to-date examples and decent
test questions at the ends of each chapter.  I take it with me most places
now... work, the bar, home.  It's a fun read and I highly recommend it.

The options they were looking at to allow groups to use the space in
the evenings/weekends for a reduced rate didn't pass the board vote so
that is out.  As a member, I can sponsor 2 hours of meeting time this
month for the OWASP meeting, anything over that hits the regular
$35/hour rate.  I know we were talking about a longer get together so
I'm not sure if that'll work or not.  Timothy, did you investigate
getting any funds from OWASP?

Regarding Ushahidi, it sounds like they've been making progress with
their security group.  Some details are at
http://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Security+Working+Group including
the submission process (emailing them).  Security issues are published
publicly at http://security.ushahidi.com/

I'm still figuring out if they'd like to be present (live or virtual)
at our meeting but I think the next steps here are to determine where
and when we want to do this and how many people will show up.  Towards
that end, I think scheduling online last time had good feedback, so I
made a link we can schedule with:
http://www.doodle.com/mu3486diwmrarpb4

It's tough to find a good day so I threw some variety in there but
it's by no means official - if everyone can find another good day or
you want me to add one to the list just let me know, I just wanted to
get the ball rolling.  We talked about meeting for 2-4 hours in an
evening, so figure 6pm or so on whatever day?

Also, did anyone else play with the virtual machine?  Any trouble
getting it up and running?

Cheers,

Wil

That's great to know about for future meetings with Collective Agency.  Thanks
for following up with that.  We could either find a sponsor for the meeting to
extend it to 4 hours for a very reasonable $70, or just have it elsewhere.
Anyone think their company would jump at the chance to sponsor it?

I did read up on chapter funding, and besides the method we've been using so far
(having sponsors for individual meetings) it looks like we can either start
encouraging paid memberships or looking for local companies to sponsor us on an
annual basis.  I could probably ask the OWASP board for "start up" funds of some
sort, since we're a young chapter, but chances are they're going to come back at
some point with strong with encouragement to start asking people to join as
$50/year members.  (Going this route doesn't mean everyone must pay to join
meetings.  It just means we'd be pestering you all the time, OPB-style, to pony
up. =)  If you guys are cool with that, I'm fine with it as well, but I had
initially hoped to establish a strong attendance and regular meetings before
going there.


For FLOSSHack, I'm kind of interested in trying out FreeGeek.  We haven't had a
meeting there yet, and it seems it could accommodate quite a few people, even if
folks do get a bit spread out through the building.  (That may actually be OK
for this kind of event, as folks might want to be heads-down hacking now and
then with less interruption.)

Great!  I'm glad they are getting organized about their security posture.  Makes
reporting issues much easier.

Great.  I wanted to do this, but hadn't got around to it.  I think based on the
replies I received to the "weeknight vs. weekend" question, the majority of
people preferred doing it on a weekend.

The most important consideration, though, is scheduling with our venue.  If we
do go with FreeGeek, Sundays would probably be best based on what Paul told me
off-list.  Collective Agency probably has a bit more flexibility on this.

Unfortunately my schedule this month has become totally crazy and I will be out
of town for a lot of it.  I've added the weekend days I can do to the doodle
page (which are May 19 & 20, or June 2 & 3).  Doing the 2nd and 3rd is probably
safest from a planning perspective, but I also don't want to steal any thunder
from the meeting we have on the 10th.

I'm fine with doing it later in the day on the weekend, but earlier works too.
Earlier might be better on a Sunday.

No time yet. =(  I'm sure it won't be too tough to throw together though.

Thanks for keeping the ball rolling!

I didn't know we had a meeting scheduled for the 10th.  Maybe we could
use that meeting to remind people about this and do the FLOSSHack a
couple weeks afterwards (giving time for people to set up the VM).  I
scheduled it close in just because otherwise it might get put off
forever but bumping to mid-late June could be a good idea.

Later in June would actually work better for me, like the weekend of June
23rd. FreeGeek sounds like a good place to start and I like the suggestion
about being spread out a little so you can go heads down on a problem. If
FreeGeek doesn't work out, I might be able to get work to sponsor a monthly
session but I'll have to check on that after the start of the fiscal year
next month. I'm with Tim that funding the chapter OPB style would not be
ideal this early. Might be my naive thinking, but given the
start-up/venture capital scene in Portland, getting a few companies to pony
up a few bucks a month shouldn't be that hard. Maybe in return we could
hold brown-bag sessions to talk about things we learned at a high level.

I'm planning on working on getting the VM up and running this weekend as
it's my first free time in a long while.

Cheers,
Matt

I'm checking into using a classroom at our college.  Got the blessing
from IT and they would be willing to setup a dedicated 10MB circuit for
this. I just need facilities to give the OK.

One question I was asked is if we have insurance.

She did ask about terrorism insurance, but I negotiated down to just
liability in case something gets broken. :) I'm checking into seeing if

rest of today so I'll have to get back to the group on Monday.

Yes, OWASP does carry liability insurance for chapter meetings.  If we decide to
book this or other events at your school, we can request a certificate of
insurance by submitting info about the "event venue, date, approx. # of attendees".

HTH,

As much as I don't want to keep pushing the date back, I think it probably is
best to push the first FLOSSHack out past the June 11th meeting.  Most of the
pieces are falling into place now, so I do want to nail down a date, even if it
is a ways out.  That'll give us a deadline to work towards on other logistics.

Let me ask about FreeGeek availability in late June and I'll get back to you all.

thanks,
tim

List,

This might be a little off topic but for those who are working in the
information security field or are going interested in the field it sounds
like an interesting opportunity to hear from law enforcement and the FBI
are concerned about in the security space.

to protect their businesses from electronic threats.****

 ****

Put down that spy novel, the Cold War is not over; it has merely moved into
a new arena: the global marketplace. Every year, billions of U.S. dollars
are lost to foreign and domestic sources who deliberately target economic
intelligence in flourishing U.S. industries and technologies. Are you aware
of how economic intelligence is gathered through cyber intrusions that may
be difficult to detect? Are you or your employees unwitting participants in
these attacks? How can you be sure?****

 ****

At the Citizens Crime Commission's upcoming Public Safety Spotlight, *Oregon
FBI Special Agent in Charge, Greg Fowler,* will provide a high-level
briefing of why businesses are targeted and how. Attendees will receive a
local threat assessment specifically developed for Oregon and Washington
business executives informed by actual cases. The presentation will feature
a panel discussion with executives from local companies on lessons learned.

*Upcoming topics in the series:*****

* *****

*Police & Community in Crisis: Calling 911 for Mental Health Treatment*****

City of Portland 911 receives close to a million calls each year in
Multnomah County and more than 400,000 of those calls send a police
officer. Only 30,000 of those calls result in an arrest, yet each year an
average of 1,000 involuntary holds are placed on persons deemed a danger to
themselves or others due to their mental illness. That?s nearly three per
day. This public safety spotlight event brings into sharp focus the
challenges faced by police officers when community mental health options
and support disappear. *Portland Police Chief Mike Reese* discusses this
alarming trend and the increasing impact on our public safety resources.
The *Citizens Crime Commission Mental Health Task Force* will present
findings illuminating the need for more coordination and information
sharing in order to support both police and persons in mental health
crisis. ****

 ****

*Governor?s Public Safety Commission; What is the ROI for Prison Beds?*****

*Chief Justice De Muniz* leads a panel discussion on the findings of the
Governor?s Public Safety Commission and the challenges ahead for the
state. While we are experiencing falling crime rates, general fund
expenditures for the Department of Corrections are increasing, driven by
ballot measures and  legislation mandating longer prison sentences. At the
same time, state revenue shortfalls are reducing funding for schools and
social services. Can we achieve less crime and improve public safety
without building more prisons? How do we invest our public safety dollars
to achieve better outcomes of less crime at a lower cost?****

*These events are brought to you due to the generous sponsorship of
businesses who support **
public safety in our community.*****

Sorry, I forgot to reply to this...

I think you're probably right.  It would be easiest if we just record the
session and edit/post it later.  At least for this first event, we can provide
remote participants access via IM/IRC/phone as a reliable way to communicate.
For instance, if someone participating remotely finds a good vulnerability and
wants to share it, we could throw them on speakerphone while they paste any code
segments into chat/pastebin/etc.

However, I'm not at all opposed to trying something like Google Hangouts.  If
someone wants to experiment with that, we could always test it out in tandem.

For the recording, does anyone have a tri-pod digital camera we could set up?  I
have a decent webcam, but probably wouldn't be ideal.

Message-ID: <4FB5A186.2090004@vsecurity.com>

Howdy,

June 24 and July 1 are two possible dates at FreeGeek for a Sunday FLOSSHack
workshop.  I've set up another Doodle:
  http://www.doodle.com/xxbhahxxt2a5e2ik

Please take a moment to note if either/both of these would work for you.  If
neither of the dates work for you (and you're really bummed about it!) add your
name/handle to the poll anyway with no dates checked.  (If too many people can't
make those dates we'll investigate alternative venues/dates.)

Thanks!

Also, can I get a rough head count of how many people are planning on
attending? I need to tell the facilities people how many to expect.

Thanks!

It's looking like July 1 is pretty strongly preferred right now, but only 4
people have responded.  Please get your vote in if you are interested in
attending.  I plan on nailing this date down within a few days.

cheers,
