<PRE>Greetings,

Cambia Health Solutions has an opening for an Application Security Engineer. We are a cutting-edge healthcare company that is very cloud integrated and CI/CD based. I would like to share the following job description with any interested parties with experience in both development and security.

Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions. I have been with Cambia for only 5 months but I can say that it is one of the most security conscious and well-supported security organizations I have worked for in my 21+ years of IT positions.

Thanks very much,

Ben
