We are the market leader in the fast-growing area of Software Security Assurance (SSA). SSA gives organizations the power to ensure that their entire software portfolio -- whether develop internally or acquired through 3rd parties -- is secure and free of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyber attackers to steal valuable data and cause mayhem.

*           Contributing to project planning and other project deliverables.
*           Customizing the implementation of Fortify's production and test products.
*           Collaborating with Product Management and Engineering to enhance products.
*           Represent Fortify's technical, business, and professional values to customers, partners, and peers
*           Work is conducted mostly at customer sites; extensive travel is required.
*           Local Candidates STRONGLY preferred.
