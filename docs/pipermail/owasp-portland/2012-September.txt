Hi all,

I finally got around to posting the vulnerability details for the
Ushahidi flaws that have been fixed so far:
  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/FLOSSHack_One#Findings

The information I posted for each is just what was given to me, so if
you want more details, follow the CVE links through to the git commit,
or consult the person who found it. ;-)

Cheers,
tim
