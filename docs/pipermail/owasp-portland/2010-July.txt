Subject: [Owasp-portland] OWASP BoF at OSCON Thursday night - ESAPI for PHP
	and more!
Message-ID: <9E32AAAD-AC1E-48D8-AE91-85467EB6B6EB@owasp.org>

Hi there,

Sorry for the late notice, but I'm putting on an OWASP Birds of a Feather at OSCON tomorrow night (Thursday). I don't think there will be much trouble getting in after hours - the goons are only there during the day as far as I can tell. 

It'll be me talking about ESAPI for PHP initially but then an open floor for anyone who wants to shoot the webappsec breeze. 

We're at the Oregon Convention Center at 8 pm. 

Love to see you all there if you can be. Again, a thousand apologies for the really late notice.  

thanks,
Andrew
