Message-ID: <20150117005721.GM1779@sentinelchicken.org>


Hi OWASPers.  Hope the new year is treating you well.

Our Portland OWASP chapter NEEDS speakers and discussion leads for our
2015 chapter meetings.  Just about any security topic is potentially
fair game, but here are a few suggestions of the types of things we
would like: 

* Any technical talks on specific classes of vulnerabilities
  (OWASP top 10 or similar)

* Your experiences in trying to apply OWASP principles in the real
  world

* Emerging threats or security risks associated with new technologies
  (HTML5, popular mobile paradigms, etc)

* Lead a discussion with the audience on controversial security or
  privacy topics

* Root cause analysis of why common development practices or platform
  constraints lead to software vulnerabilities


We could definitely use help in spreading the word, so take a moment
to think of anyone you know who might be interested in speaking.  

Also, if you have any ideas of things you would like to hear about or
speakers you would like us to invite, let us know and we'll see what
we can do.

To submit a proposal or idea, please email me directly.

Thanks!
tim
