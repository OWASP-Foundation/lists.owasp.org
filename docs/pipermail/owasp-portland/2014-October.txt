Subject: [Owasp-portland] OWASP Chapter -- Annual Planning Meeting (Oct 20)
Message-ID: <20141016231715.GJ1844@sentinelchicken.org>


Hi OWASPers,

We're holding a planning meeting on Monday to sketch out our plans for
the chapter this next year.  Please join us if you are interested in
helping us chart our course.

More info here:

Please be sure to RSVP by emailing me privately if you plan to attend.
This will just help me give Tugboat a heads up if we have a lot of
people.

Thanks!
tim
