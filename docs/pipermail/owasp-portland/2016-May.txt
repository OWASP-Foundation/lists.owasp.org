Subject: [OWASP-Portland] In need of an experienced incident responder
Message-ID: <20160521091418.7c3f8d4b@shannon.sentinelchicken.org>

Hi Everyone,

At one point in time, I used to perform forensics and incident response
services.  I rarely do it anymore, but I still regularly get asked by folks for
help when their websites get hacked or when they get infected by the latest
ransomware.

If there are any local consultants who can help with this kind of thing, please
contact me off list.  I have an urgent need in this area as we speak.

Thanks!
tim
