Subject: [Owasp-portland] BSides Planning Meeting - Monday
Message-ID: <20121022114506.GH26390@sentinelchicken.org>


Howdy,

Hope the gloomy Autumn is treating everyone well.  The organizer for
BSides, Esteban, has invited us to put on an OWASP birds-of-a-feather
or demonstration session at the conference.  I think it's a great
idea, but I'm not sure what I'll time to pull together between now and
then, as I'll be out of town all this week at AppSecUSA.

So I thought the easiest way to pull something together would be to
see who has a little time to pitch in between now and Nov 9, and then
to hold a planning meeting at a local pub.  I propose we have the
meeting the evening of Monday, Oct 29.  Please email me back if you
are interested in helping out.  

Thanks!
tim
