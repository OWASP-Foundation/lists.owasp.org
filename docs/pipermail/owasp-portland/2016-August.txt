Subject: [OWASP-Portland] Manager Product Security @ Simple
Message-ID: <CAJZDTgH7uY73v7s_mzbUR+gPw+AnEbxLWuHX4j2C4-YrKPcm8w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Portland OWASP -

Simple is recruiting for a Manager of Product Security
<http://grnh.se/j0cq12>.  This is a new position which will lead application
security related to our online banking products.  The role will be involved
with both security engineering of the application stack, as well as baking
Security into product management processes. It will have lots of social
interaction and coordination with both product management and engineers.
Also leading a small team of security engineers focused on pen testing, and
indirect leadership for a decentralized group of engineers in various
disciplines who do security work on autonomous feature teams.

If you are interested, please apply online and hit me up with any
questions.  Also, save the date for Thursday, Aug 25th. We will be hosting
the OWASP meeting at the Simple office. Adam Baldwin will be giving a talk
on security considerations with Node.js
<http://calagator.org/events/1250470488>.  It should be a good topic, a
good speaker, and an opportunity to check out our new office space.

Thanks, Portland OWASP!
