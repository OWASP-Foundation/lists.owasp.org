Hi Everyone,

I thought I'd break the silence and see if anyone has any experience
with this trade regulation.  For "fun" I was just reading through the
Oregon statutes related to information disclosure and was surprised to
find some relatively strong language around information security
programs.  I'm looking here:

The 646A.600 section is relevant, and in particular, I find 646A.622
intriguing, since it applies to just about any organization.  Does
anyone have experience with how this section is interpreted for various
sizes of businesses?
