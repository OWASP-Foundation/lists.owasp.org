Hi Portland OWASP -

The local ISACA chapter (I'm on the board) thought there might be interest
in our monthly luncheon next week among the OWASP community.  The topic is
on Bug Bounty program best practices, and the speaker is my colleague from
Simple Dylan Saccomanni who is a senior member of our pen testing team.

If you are able to make it, please register online, and you can use the
lower-priced "member" rate ($20, and includes catered lunch and 1 hour of
documented CPE for any professional certifications you maintain).  Also
note that we waive fees <http://www.isaca-oregon.org/fee-waiver-policy.html>
for students and folks who are currently unemployed.

Thanks for letting us cross-post.  I hope to see you there.

*March 10, 2016 ISACA Luncheon Event*

*Bug Bounty Programs*


Bug bounties have become increasingly popular as a staple of strong
security programs, so much so that even traditionally conservative
companies are beginning to use them. However, they are very difficult to
implement correctly. In this talk I will discuss a brief history of bug
bounties, the current landscape of bug bounty efficiency (including
statistics from the programs of small, medium and large companies) and how
to optimize a program for success.

*Speaker: Dylan Saccomanni*

Dylan Saccomanni is a software security engineer with six years of
experience in penetration testing and vulnerability research. He has found
and disclosed security vulnerabilities in large companies like GoDaddy and
Microsoft, and before working at Simple he ran a security consultancy
catering to Series A tech startups.
