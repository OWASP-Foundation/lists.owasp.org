<PRE>Hello,

Cambia Health Solutions is looking to add a new  Security Architect to the InfoSec team.  The job is located in downtown Portland.  A link to the job posting is below.  The description is for a general Security Architect, but I know the focus is very much in the Application Security space, so even if you have not done a lot of traditional Security Architecture work, your AppSec experience may make it worthwhile to apply.  If you have any questions about the job or the team you'd be working with please feel free to reach out.  Thanks.
