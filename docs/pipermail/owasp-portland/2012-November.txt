Subject: [Owasp-portland] Next FLOSSHack - Tentative Date
Message-ID: <20121116002050.GM2752@sentinelchicken.org>


Hi everyone,

I've lined up a tentative date of January 13 for the next FLOSSHack.
I'm open to nominations for target applications.  Two applications
that have been suggested in the past are:

  http://www.resourcespace.org/
  http://openmrs.org/


Please feel free to suggest others.  Keep in mind the ideal critera
for a candidate:
  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/FLOSSHack_for_Organizers#Selecting_a_Target


If you want to nominate a particular application and are willing to
manage the communication with the software maintainer, then say so.
It will take a load off of me and make it all the more likely that we
choose it. =)


cheers,
tim

Message-ID: <20121116002814.GN2752@sentinelchicken.org>


Hi again,

I was wondering how much interest there might be in holding a session
of lightning talks sometime in mid-December.  Perhaps the week of the
10th?  

After chatting with a few folks over the past few months, it seems
like several people could put together 10-15min of content, but may
not have time for more.  Anyone have an interesting project they are
working on and would like to give a brief overview?  Anyone have a
bone to pick with X, Y, or Z technology and need to vent?  Want to
lead a discussion on some topic that's been nagging at your
consciousness?  Let us know!

I don't have any specific applications to suggest, but I will throw a
couple of links out there for projects that are hosted and (at least
partially) maintained locally by the OSU Open Source Lab (osuosl.org):

http://osuosl.org/services/development - This is more of their own
applications that they maintain in-house.

http://osuosl.org/services/hosting/communities - This is a list of projects
that have hosting at the OSL and typically have some sort of contributions
to code maintenance investments as well. This list includes some obviously
big names that likely wouldn't need asisstance (Apache, Debian, Drupal,
etc), but there are some smaller projects that would likely love to have
some code audits done.

Hope that helps.

Since security is one of the hats I wear at the OSL, I should point out
Ganeti Web Manager would be a good project of ours to target. We're
currently running it with multiple layers of protection in deployment, but
I can't promise everyone else who runs it is defending their deployment as
carefully as ours. So GWM could stand to benefit from some expert scruitiny.

The fun thing about pentesting this particular app is that successful hacks
compromise not just one dinky web server, but potentially an entire fleet.

I could do a talk on static code analysis and using it to find XSS and
other vulnerabilities.

Hi everyone,

I contacted the developers of ResourceSpace, since David had been
wanting to target this software for a while.  They responded quickly,
and here's part of the response:

"The software has been through several commercial penetration tests
now, funded by large corporations that use the software. However, as
you no doubt know it is never possible to give a 100% guarantee that
the code is secure."


While I agree there's almost always more security issues to be found,
I'm starting to think maybe this isn't the best target for the next
FLOSSHack.  The software is maintained by a for-profit company (who
could pay for auditing) and they've already had it audited multiple
times.  If there were no other options, certainly it's not *bad* to
target this one, but right now I'm thinking OpenMRS or one of the OSU
projects might be better.

What do the rest of you think?

tim
