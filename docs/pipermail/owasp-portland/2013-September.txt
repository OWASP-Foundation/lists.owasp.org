Subject: [Owasp-portland] Planning Meeting
Message-ID: <20130914012133.GM3522@sentinelchicken.org>



Greetings,

I would like to hold a planning meeting in late October or early
November.  It will just be an informal gathering to discuss what
people want out of the chapter and how we can make it happen.  Here
are some ideas of things we could be organizing over the next couple
of years:

- More chapter meetings.  I'd like us to get in the habit of having
  monthly or bi-monthly meetings.  If we don't have enough formal
  speakers, we can always do panel talks, lightning talks, or
  moderated discussions-- just sharing news from the trenches. 

- More FLOSSHacks.  Everyone keeps asking about these, and I really
  want to do more, but it's something I don't have time to organze
  more than maybe once or twice a year.  Would be great to get help on 
  this to do them quarterly.

- Local/regional conferences or training days.  Larger OWASP chapters
  often do security conferences and one-off training days.  These both
  promote participation, awareness, and raise funds for the chapter.

- Corporate sponsorship.  Most chapters don't support themselves
  through individual membership fees...  Typically security companies
  pitch in to sponsor venues, refreshments, parties, whatever.  We
  haven't really advertised sponsorship opportunities much (and OWASP
  has strict rules about this, which is a good thing), but I think to
  put on more fun events we should investigate next steps.

- YOUR ideas.  Yes, James and I want to hear these.  OWASP is a very
  eclectic and loosely structured organization.  If you have an itch
  to scratch, then jump in and just do it.


Please email me privately if you think you can pitch in some time to
help out with the planning and organization.  Then we'll nail down a
time and place.

Thank you!
tim
