Message-ID: <4F591EE2.2010600@vsecurity.com>

Hey all,

Hope to see you at our meeting tonight
<http://calagator.org/events/1250461909>.  Afterward, I was thinking it
would be fun to go grab a pint somewhere nearby.  Does anyone have
suggestions?

Here are a few possibilities:

  Bailey's Taproom?
  213 Southwest Broadway
  Portland, OR 97205
  baileystaproom.com?


  Davis Street Tavern?
  500 NW Davis Street
  Portland, OR 97209
  davisstreettavern.com?


  Deschutes Brewery & Public House?
  210 Northwest 11th Avenue
  Portland, OR 97209
  deschutesbrewery.com?


I've only been to Bailey's.  It is nice, but small.  Let me know if you
have other ideas or any strong preferences.

Thanks,
tim

Hey Guys,

Jim Manico from WhiteHat Security has offered to come down to Portland and
do a talk on Top 10 web coding defenses. I'm trying to get a gauge on how
many people can make it to that event. I mentioned hosting this at Nike in
Beaverton, but if we could get the Collective Agency again for cheap (e.g.
Free) that would be great as well.

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!

Subject: [Owasp-portland] "FLOSSHack" in early April?
Message-ID: <4F5E62C6.5000403@vsecurity.com>

Hi Everyone,

Thanks to those were able to make it to our meeting last week.  We had
about 10-11 attendees plus our speaker and a couple of his friends, so
it was a solid turn out.


Next on my radar is to flesh out this idea I've been wanting to try out.
 In the interest of having a catchy name, I'm calling it "FLOSSHack"
(for Free/Libre Open Source Software Hacking).  Feel free to suggest a
catchier name.  Here's the gist of it:

1. Gather together folks who are interested in getting down and dirty in
technical details to sharpen their penetration testing and security code
review skills.

2. Select a FLOSS application that people are interested in testing.
Let people work on their own for a week or so before a meeting.

3. Sit down together to discover and discuss as many vulnerabilities as
possible that were found in the application.  Discuss secific
exploitation scenarios and mitigation strategies. Openly share all of
the results of testing within the group (but avoid sharing publicly just
yet).

4. Work with the developer of the software to address the issues through
a responsible disclosure process.  Those who discover bugs get full
public credit for the issues they find (if they wish) and experience in
responsible notification and interaction with software maintainers.



I expect there will be a number of details to work out, but I would like
to take a quick poll on a few things.  If you don't mind taking a couple
of minutes to answer these questions (sent back to the list,
preferably), that would be great:

A. Would you be interested in participating in such an event?
   If "no", stop here.


B. What kinds of vulnerabilities are you most interested in learning
   about? (e.g. SQL injection, buffer overflows, XXE, ...)


C. What technologies/development platforms are you most experienced
   with?  What technologies/development platforms are you most
   interested in learning more about?


D. Do you have suggestions for what open source projects you would like
   to perform an audit of?


E. Will a FLOSSHack session on April 10 or 11 work for your schedule?


Thanks!

Subject: [Owasp-portland] PCI And Mobile Credit Card Terminals
Message-ID: <CABU9uZi9EFu_TYLumthhny0unfrzABG=53oqvuF73cKHeFLGwg@mail.gmail.com>

At the last chapter meeting the question was raised about how mobile CC
devices like Square would fit into PCI. I asked the PCI expert at Nike and
this was his reply. Please excuse the grammar and spelling, it was sent
from his iPad.

The real answer is no one knows yet. The PCI SSC has been really vague on
this. If they accept end to end encryption where the swipe device, in this
case the Square Device, encrypts the data before the iPhone can get at it
then the solution in itself could be PCI compliant.  But the real questions
come around what happens is the iPhone can see the CC in the clear on the
screen. Then IMHO the device would have to follow the rest of the PCI, like
device hardening and the hardest; logging.



The PCI SSC has released an updated encryption document but is still very
concerned about wireless devices; thank you TJ Max.



So in the end, it is what can you get your QSA to approve.



I would say that if you can should that the swipe device makes it so you
can not get at the CC number , track data at all. And that the transport is
encrypted, and you have solid controls over you devices. Then you should be
able to get the solution easily approved without much additional controls.



On the other hand, if the CC is seen on the device, the work go a whole lot
harder.

I've received just two responses to this posting.  I'm pretty sure more
people than that are interested, considering how many eyes I've seen
light up when I describe it, but I think it is important to get more
input on the types of applications people would be interested in auditing.

Early April is also getting pretty busy for me, so if I don't get some
more feedback, I'll probably postpone this until May where I can get the
word out to more audiences.

cheers,

This actually sounds really cool but April for me isn't going to work.
If we had this in May, I would definitely put it on the calendar.

Thanks for the feedback Aaron.  Yeah, I think I will shoot for sometime
in May instead.  Stay tuned.

FLOSSHack sounds fun, hopefully I can attend whenever it gets scheduled, and make Jim's presentation in April as well.

Tim,

This actually sounds really cool but April for me isn't going to work.
If we had this in May, I would definitely put it on the calendar.

I've received just two responses to this posting.  I'm pretty sure more
people than that are interested, considering how many eyes I've seen
light up when I describe it, but I think it is important to get more
input on the types of applications people would be interested in
auditing.

Early April is also getting pretty busy for me, so if I don't get some
more feedback, I'll probably postpone this until May where I can get the
word out to more audiences.

cheers,
tim

Hey All,

I've arranged to have this meeting at the Collective Agency in downtown
Portland, like the last one. The details are in the attached calendar
entry. Please spread the word.

Thanks,
Matthew

We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act, but a
habit.

Thanks for the feedback Aaron.  Yeah, I think I will shoot for sometime
in May instead.  Stay tuned.

PS- This would be a great event for CS students interested in security,
if you know of any.
