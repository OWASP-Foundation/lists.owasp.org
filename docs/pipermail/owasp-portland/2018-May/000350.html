<PRE>Nice work Ian, Brian, Philip, Bhushan and Benny in pulling this off.  It
sure looked like a lot of coordination went into putting this together.

Thanks.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The May chapter meeting is 5/22 at 6 PM at Jama Software, 135 SW Taylor
</I>&gt;<i> Suite 200, Portland, Oregon 97204
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A panel will take on the subject of &quot;Pen Testing: How to Get Bigger Bang
</I>&gt;<i> for your Buck&quot;, including your questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Panel Discussion - Join local industry practitioners as they discuss the
</I>&gt;<i> best practices used in getting superior results from your Pen Testing. Also
</I>&gt;<i> share your ideas on Dos and Dont's of Pen testing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Moderator - Brian Ventura
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Panelists - Alexie Kojenov, Ian Melven, Benny Zhao, and Scott Cutler
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alexei Kojenov is a Senior Application Security Consultant with years of
</I>&gt;<i> prior software development experience. During his career with IBM, he
</I>&gt;<i> gradually moved from writing code to breaking code. Since late 2016, Alexei
</I>&gt;<i> has been working as a consultant at Aspect Security, helping businesses
</I>&gt;<i> identify and fix vulnerabilities and design secure applications. Aspect
</I>&gt;<i> Security was recently acquired by Ernst&amp;Young and joined EY Advisory
</I>&gt;<i> cybersecurity practice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ian Melven is Principal Security Engineer at New Relic. He has worked in
</I>&gt;<i> security for almost 20 years, including roles at Mozilla, Adobe, McAfee and
</I>&gt;<i> @stake.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Benny Zhao is a Security Engineer at Jive Software. His experience focuses
</I>&gt;<i> on identifying code vulnerabilities and securing software by building tools
</I>&gt;<i> to help automate security testing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scott Cutler has been interested in computer security since he was a kid,
</I>&gt;<i> and started attending DefCon in 2004. He got his Computer Science degree
</I>&gt;<i> from UC Irvine in 2009 while working for the on-campus residential network
</I>&gt;<i> department for 4 years. After graduating he worked first as QA for a SAN
</I>&gt;<i> NIC card manufacturer, then switched to essentially create their DevOps
</I>&gt;<i> program from scratch. From these jobs he has gained a lot of experience
</I>&gt;<i> with networking, build processes, Linux/Unix administration and scripting,
</I>&gt;<i> and Python development. In 2012 Scott began working in the security field
</I>&gt;<i> full time as a FIPS, Common Criteria, and PCI Open Protocol evaluator for
</I>&gt;<i> InfoGard Laboratories (now UL Transaction Security). During this time he
</I>&gt;<i> got his OSCP and a good understanding of federal security requirements,
</I>&gt;<i> assessment processes, and documentation (ask him about NIST SPs!). In 2015
</I>&gt;<i> scott switched over to Aspect Security (now EY) to put his OSCP to good use
</I>&gt;<i> and became a full-time application security engineer, doing pen-tests as
</I>&gt;<i> well as developing both internal and external training.
