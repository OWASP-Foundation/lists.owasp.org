<PRE>Hello,

The June meeting will be on Monday, June 18, 2018 at 6 pm, hosted by WebMD

The topic will be &quot;Machine Learning vs Cryptocoin Miners&quot; presented by Jonn
Callahan

*Machine Learning vs Cryptocoin Miners Description*: With the advent of
cryptocurrencies as a prevalent economic entity, attackers have begun
turning compromised boxes and environments into cash via cryptocoin mining.
This has given rise for the opportunity to detect compromised environments
by analyzing network traffic logs for evidence of cryptocoin miners.
Specifically, I'll be reviewing various ML and statistical analysis
techniques leveraged against VPC Flow Logs. This talk will not be a deep
dive of the math involved but instead a general discussion of these
techniques and why I chose them.

*Speaker's Bio*: Jonn Callahan is a principal appsec consultant at nVisium.
Jonn was previously heavily involved in the OWASP DC and NoVA chapters. He
has been working in appsec for half a decade now, initially within the DoD
and now commercially with many high-visibility companies. Recently, Jonn
has been digging into ML to find ways to bridge it and the security
industry in an intelligent and usable fashion.

Also, if folks are looking to get more involved in Portland OWASP or help
out, please get in touch - we have a planning meeting coming up soon and
are working on this year's Training Day as well as upcoming chapter
meetings and could always use more help!

thanks,
ian
