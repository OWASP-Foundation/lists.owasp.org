<PRE>Hi,

The May chapter meeting is 5/22 at 6 PM at Jama Software, 135 SW Taylor
Suite 200, Portland, Oregon 97204

A panel will take on the subject of &quot;Pen Testing: How to Get Bigger Bang
for your Buck&quot;, including your questions:

Panel Discussion - Join local industry practitioners as they discuss the
best practices used in getting superior results from your Pen Testing. Also
share your ideas on Dos and Dont's of Pen testing.

Moderator - Brian Ventura

Panelists - Alexie Kojenov, Ian Melven, Benny Zhao, and Scott Cutler

Alexei Kojenov is a Senior Application Security Consultant with years of
prior software development experience. During his career with IBM, he
gradually moved from writing code to breaking code. Since late 2016, Alexei
has been working as a consultant at Aspect Security, helping businesses
identify and fix vulnerabilities and design secure applications. Aspect
Security was recently acquired by Ernst&amp;Young and joined EY Advisory
cybersecurity practice.

Ian Melven is Principal Security Engineer at New Relic. He has worked in
security for almost 20 years, including roles at Mozilla, Adobe, McAfee and
@stake.

Benny Zhao is a Security Engineer at Jive Software. His experience focuses
on identifying code vulnerabilities and securing software by building tools
to help automate security testing.

Scott Cutler has been interested in computer security since he was a kid,
and started attending DefCon in 2004. He got his Computer Science degree
from UC Irvine in 2009 while working for the on-campus residential network
department for 4 years. After graduating he worked first as QA for a SAN
NIC card manufacturer, then switched to essentially create their DevOps
program from scratch. From these jobs he has gained a lot of experience
with networking, build processes, Linux/Unix administration and scripting,
and Python development. In 2012 Scott began working in the security field
full time as a FIPS, Common Criteria, and PCI Open Protocol evaluator for
InfoGard Laboratories (now UL Transaction Security). During this time he
got his OSCP and a good understanding of federal security requirements,
assessment processes, and documentation (ask him about NIST SPs!). In 2015
scott switched over to Aspect Security (now EY) to put his OSCP to good use
and became a full-time application security engineer, doing pen-tests as
well as developing both internal and external training.
