Hello OWASP Portland Chapter Members, 

The OWASP Portland chapter elects three officers every year who foster the chapter and manage chapter events. The roles are briefly described below: 


    1. Leader - Fulfills the role of the overall caretaker of the chapter and, with the help of other volunteers, organizes the chapter meetings and the Training Day. This role is equivalent to the President of the chapter. 
    2. Community Outreach Lead - Actively engages with the community and seeks out sponsors, speakers, and meeting places for the chapter meetings. 
    3. Treasurer - Keeps track of financial aspects of the chapter and coordinates with the OWASP mother-ship the financial activities. 
The OWASP organization does not require a particular style of governance from its chapters. You can find more information at the following link: 

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Handbook/Chapter_5:_Governance 

We are soliciting nominations for the year 2018 for the three roles described above. If you are interested in serving the board please send me your name, the role you are interested in, phone number, and the best email to communicate. 

A meeting will be held on Wednesday, January 3rd, at Rockbottom Brewery (Downtown Portland), at 6:30 PM to elect and install the new leaders. The presence at the meeting is required to be elected. 

Thank you very much. 
Bhushan Gupta 
Leader - 2017

Will you send this out to the OWASP membership? 

--------- 

It is time again. Are you looking for: some free training? Games to 
play? A way into the pen-testing world? An understanding of how 
attackers could get into your network? Prizes, gifts, fun for kids to 
adults... 

All of this and more is available in the Holiday Hack Challenge: 
https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2017/ 

This is a free site, built by the big names in SANS pen-testing and 
other courses. All previous year challenges are available. This year's 
is still open for winning prizes. Previous years are great to get more 
skills and entertainment. 

The challenge is built for all levels and Ed Skoudis, the primary 
creator, designed these challenges to allow kids to adults to get 
something out of it and even recommends bringing your own children into 
the game with a video-style section, where they can find hints and pass 
those up to parents to take to the next level! 

I highly recommend each of you participating, either to hone your skills 
or provide some educational entertainment to you and your family over 
the holidays and whenever you find time to explore. 

Cheers.
