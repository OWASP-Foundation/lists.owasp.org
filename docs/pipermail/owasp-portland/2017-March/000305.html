Compete against your fellow ISSA Portland members in a contest of hacking

This event will provide value for everyone from a non-coder with zero
hacking experience to a seasoned penetration tester.  There are challenges
for all skill levels and interest built into the game and we will have
expert help on hand to help anyone who wants it.

We will provide some initial training, lunch and the vulnerable
infrastructure for you to test your skills against.
