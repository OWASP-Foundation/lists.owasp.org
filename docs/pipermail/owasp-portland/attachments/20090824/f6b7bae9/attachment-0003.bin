DESCRIPTION:All\,<br>&nbsp\;&nbsp\;&nbsp\; I'm sorry for those that couldn'
 t make it to the 1st meeting on the 12th\, that seems likely the result of 
 an emailing error on my part. It was pretty productive for organizing the f
 uture of the chapter. Didn't learn a blasted thing about Web Application Se
 curity. Fortunately the wrinkles are getting ironed out\, and I've got some
  assistance from Tim Morgan for future events so we can ramp up the knowled
 ge. Below you'll find the information for the next scheduled meeting. If yo
 u have any questions let me know. I'll send out speaker or discussion topic
  information as soon as I can.<br><br>Date: September 30th\, 2009<br>Time: 
 03:30PM - 04:30PM PST <br>Location: US Bank Tower Plaza 111SW 5th Avenue\, 
 Portland\, OR.<br><br><br>Thanks\,<br>AJ Dexter<br>801-372-9378<br>\n\nView
