<PRE>Hi there.

Simple is recruiting for an Applications Security Engineer with a focus on
web &amp; mobile app pen testing (
<A HREF="http://banksimple.theresumator.com/apply/b9GKYw/Applications-Security-Engineer.html">http://banksimple.theresumator.com/apply/b9GKYw/Applications-Security-Engineer.html</A>).
The ideal candidate would have, or be on a similar career track, to picking
up an OSCP.  They enjoy finding vulnerabilities, and are able to chat with
developers to coordinate both remediation, and provide mentoring on how the
vulnerability could have been avoided to begin with. Someone self-motivated
who enjoys both the project/engagement-model of pen testing, balanced with
tackling fun special projects that push security forward like implementing
secure code analysis tools into our dev pipeline, would do really well.
Also, they wouldn't be alone -- they would be joining an existing security
team of 6 (in total company of &lt; 300), including a colleague focusing on
the pen testing program already.  Never walk alone!

We're also on the lookout for the right security engineer (
<A HREF="http://banksimple.theresumator.com/apply/NOpz7x/Security-Engineer.html">http://banksimple.theresumator.com/apply/NOpz7x/Security-Engineer.html</A>).
This role works closely with our software engineering teams on the service
platform and deployment pipeline. They could focus on infrastructure (for
example, upgrades to our log pipeline and security threat analytics tools).
Or the right candidate could dive into our software engineering teams on
new features (for example, work on our data encryption implementation, or
Scala development focused on upgrades to our authentication or access
controls in our product).

Simple is a growing and stable company here in Portland (currently at NW
13th/Lovejoy, and moving over to a new office in inner SE later this
year).  We can fill these positions here, or remote (we have a very
remote-friendly engineering culture). We pay well, offer great work/life
balance, really value diversity, hook employees up with a nice hardware &amp;
software setup, and are a place that really values an engineering culture
that learns and grows careers.  Interested?  Please feel free to ping me
directly -- my work email is <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-portland">dave at simple.com.</A>

Best,
-Dave
