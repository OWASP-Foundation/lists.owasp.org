Hi all,

We have a chapter meeting coming up at the Collective Agency.  Details
here:

We will be serving pizza and some sort of beverages, as sponsored by
WhiteHat Security.  I would *really* appreciate it if you RSVP to this
event so I can better estimate how much to order.  Just email me
privately for that.

Hope to see you there!
