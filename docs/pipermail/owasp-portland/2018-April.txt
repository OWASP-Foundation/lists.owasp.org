Subject: [OWASP-Portland] interest in live streaming of OURSA conference ?
Message-ID: <CA+0m=Fc-b_u2rr3COzs9zMaW015GKH7ydOjT_q_RVkR6sTf7RA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The OURSA Conference (http://www.oursa.org
<https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.oursa.org&sa=D&ust=1523421161048000&usg=AFQjCNHUrlU_xHgv0j1m2xoBsDWVZ1UM0g>)
was started in response to a severe lack in diversity at the RSA
Conference. This event was put together by many security folks from all
over and will be happening on April 17, 2018.

A single track of talks will start at 9AM and go through to 5pm with four
topic sessions. There's more information here: https://www.oursa.org/
<https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.oursa.org/&sa=D&ust=1523421161049000&usg=AFQjCNF06znuOuB6adzoONFOICFkB3PKFg>

New Relic via the efforts of Esteban Gutierrez is willing to host a
livestream of the conference here in Portland. In order to be able to plan
appropriately, we need to get an idea of how many folks are interested and
would attend.
if you're interested, please let Esteban know here :

Join SANS Instructors Brian Ventura and Derek Hill for an evening of 
conversation regarding Secure configurations - Built-in Security 
Enhancementsand the benefit of the CISSP certification from a hiring 
manager perspective.


*TOPICS*
1. In the information security news, we regularly hear about the latest 
vulnerabilities with recommendations to scramble and patch immediately. 
This is an important aspect of our industry, however there are other 
security considerations. Are there configurations we can set now in our 
systems and software that will protect us? Let's explore secure 
configurations and see what we find.

2. The Hiring Manager is looking at your resume ? why does CISSP matter? 
While the CISSP is not the only thing we look at, it is a great starting 
point. What knowledge does the CISSP provide and how does one prepare 
for the exam?

Architect by day and SANS instructor by night. Brian volunteers with the

*Who is Derek Hill? *Derek Hill has over 25 years of experience in IT 
and Information Security. He currently manages an Application Security 
Team, an Infrastructure Security Team (Blue Team) and a Data Privacy 
Engineering team at HP Inc. in Vancouver, WA. His teams are responsible
