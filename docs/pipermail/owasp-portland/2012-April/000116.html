&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Based on some feedback I received from my survey, it seems like a LAMP
</I>&gt;<i> application would best match peoples' interests in open source project targets.
</I>&gt;<i> Based on recommendations from others and my own research, I'm proposing we do
</I>&gt;<i> the first FLOSSHack on one of the following apps:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  ResourceSpace &lt;<A HREF="http://www.resourcespace.org/">http://www.resourcespace.org/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  selfoss &lt;<A HREF="http://selfoss.aditu.de/">http://selfoss.aditu.de/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  OpenDocMan &lt;<A HREF="http://www.opendocman.com/">http://www.opendocman.com/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't actually looked at these terribly closely, but let me know if you have
</I>&gt;<i> any strong opinions about them.  In general, I think it would be most useful for
</I>&gt;<i> us to look at a project that has some kind of built-in access control system,
</I>&gt;<i> allows potentially untrusted users to submit persistent content, and of course
</I>&gt;<i> interacts in some way with a SQL database.  Also, projects that are under active
</I>&gt;<i> development are also strongly preferred.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought I'd also throw out some thoughts I had on how a typical FLOSSHack
</I>&gt;<i> session might go:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. As I mentioned before, we'd choose the application and announce it officially
</I>&gt;<i> maybe a week (or more?) before the date of the FLOSSHack session.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. At the beginning of the session, we may spend up to 30minutes going over
</I>&gt;<i> common vulnerabilities that might affect the application.  Perhaps even show
</I>&gt;<i> demos in WebGoat or something similar to ensure everyone has a good idea as to
</I>&gt;<i> what they are looking for.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Share vulnerabilities already found-- for those who have spent the prior week
</I>&gt;<i> looking for bugs, now would be the time they could share them with everyone
</I>&gt;<i> else.  Much discussion of the flaws, how they were found, and how they could be
</I>&gt;<i> exploited would ensue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Start hacking.  A pre-installed version of the application will be provided
</I>&gt;<i> in some way, maybe on a VM or remotely.  Collaborate on searching for various
</I>&gt;<i> types of bugs.  Occasionally, when folks spot new vulnerabilities, announce it
</I>&gt;<i> and describe the bug to others.  Maybe the resulting discussion sparks new ideas
</I>&gt;<i> for finding additional flaws.  If things are &quot;slow&quot; in this area, perhaps the
</I>&gt;<i> FLOSSHack wrangler can stop everyone once in a while to cover some security
</I>&gt;<i> topic relevant to the application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Conclude the session, hopefully, with a pile of security bugs to send off to
</I>&gt;<i> the developers in a responsible manner.  If we can find sponsors for this, maybe
</I>&gt;<i> we could have some prizes for those who find the most bugs, or the &quot;best&quot; bug
</I>&gt;<i> found, as voted on by the participants.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I expect a FLOSSHack session to last at least 2 hours.  I know that's pretty
</I>&gt;<i> long for some people's schedules, but it's designed as a workshop and it takes
</I>&gt;<i> quite a while to get familiar with an application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still not sure if it would be best to hold this kind of thing on a weeknight
</I>&gt;<i> or on a weekend.  What would people prefer?  If it makes sense, we could even
</I>&gt;<i> stretch it out into a longer weekend session (4 hours?) and then invite people
</I>&gt;<i> to come and go as they please; whatever fits peoples' schedules. I anticipate
</I>&gt;<i> setting up some way for people to join remotely as well.  Perhaps just via IRC,
</I>&gt;<i> IM, or some newfangled thing with moving pictures. (I'd appreciate volunteers to
</I>&gt;<i> help with this or anything else.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me know what you all think.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks and have a great weekend!

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS - If anyone knows any college students who are interested in computer
</I>&gt;<i> security, this would be a great event for them.  Feel free to pass along info
</I>&gt;<i> about this event, or just get them signed up to the mailing list.
