Great, thanks for keeping in touch with them.  I just asked Paul to reserve
FreeGeek for Sunday, July 1 from noon to 4pm.  I think it should work out
reasonably well having it there for the first FLOSSHack.

I'm going to start posting advertisements and getting the other logistics in place.

Best,
tim

Bumping an old thread!  I've been in contact with some people at
Ushahidi lately and things are all ready to go there.  Has there been
any progress figuring out a place for us to meet?  I've thought of
another venue which will probably be happy to host us for a few hours
but I didn't want to pursue it if other wheels were already in motion.

Cheers,

Wil

Subject: [Owasp-portland] Nginx vs. Apache2 for web service
Message-ID: <07DB504C4B29D240BE001360619FE4AF06C694EB@email2.warnerpacific.edu>

Hello All,

 

I'm doing an in depth comparison to Nginx vs. Apache2 as a case study
for moving towards using Nginx for our web servers and in doing so, I've
hit the part where I believe some input from the group would be
appreciated.  

 

Security.

 

I'm fairly well versed in locking down vHosts, .htaccess files,
redirects, rewrites, etc. on Apache2 and I'm just learning some of the
techniques found in Nginx to do the configuration in their "VCL" files.
What I'm curious about is what the "buzz" is around if Nginx  and if it
sacrifices any security for the speed?  The context of this is obviously
important  so let me flesh that out.  This would be running on:  Ubuntu
12.04 64-bit VM, 100GB HD space, 1GB RAM, MySQL, PHP5 w/ php5-gd,
php5-curl, php5-xcache, php5-fpm (for FastCGI which by most tutorials
listed as the BKM, I've changed it from a :9000 port listening to an
actual .socks listing) Varnish reverse proxy, PHPMyAdmin,
Webmin,Shorewall FW (using IP Tables) and of course Nginx running a
Wordpress site.  As mentioned I have everything setup and running right
now and it is able to handle an absurd amount of web traffic compared to
an Apache2 install; numbers wise we're talking 100 users max concurrent
@ 5000 requests w/ Apache2 vs. 750+concurrent @ 5000 requests w/ Nginx.


 

Anyways, just curious what people's thoughts were on it.

 

Thanks.

-Aaron

travelling after leaving Oregon so I'll give him a few more days before
pinging him about it.

Message-ID: <4FE5FA5F.2010009@vsecurity.com>

Hey all,

We're just over a week away from our first FLOSSHack event, which will be on
Sunday, July 1 from noon to 4pm at Free Geek.  Keep in mind that you should feel
free to come and go as you please throughout that time frame, or join us
remotely.  A general overview of the event can be found here:
  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/FLOSSHack_for_Participants

When we have the code and a VM ready for the specific version of Ushahidi we're
testing, we'll post them here (which I hope will happen soon):
  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/FLOSSHack_One


The last major detail to work out is deciding how people can join remotely and
how we'll record the event.  I think if it were left up to me to manage, I'd
just end up setting up a Google+ Hangouts room, which allows for video, screen
sharing and recording.  I'm not particularly thrilled about the utter lack of
anonymity it provides, but it is cross-platform and I can't think of a better
technical solution at the moment.  If someone else feels strongly that we should
use some other approach and would like to volunteer to manage it, I'm all ears.

thanks,
tim

Are there any in this group who are web developers with CISSPs (or maybe
some other cert)?

I've been considering a CISSP, but I haven't had the business
justification to take time out of my work day to maintain it since I
work for a marketing department and they don't really consider it much
of a priority.

Outside of writing a book, I'm not crazy about spend up all my personal
time for this so am trying to figure out if there is a way to justify it
to a marketing department or if any of you have just bit the bullet for
a period of time. Thoughts, insights?

Do OWASP meetings offer credit?

I'm a web dev & have the CISSP. I did the self-study route using Shon
Harris' book and found the test to be fairly easy. You could easily do the
self-study route in the evening and not burn up all your free time. Then
just schedule the test and you're golden.

As for justification, if you have to interface with engineers or other
process driven people at your company it'll help you manage those
interactions with a security hat on. Also, as  your coming up with new
feature requests you'll be able to better evaluation the security of those
requests and make suggestions to improve the security posture of the
feature before it goes into development, where it's cheaper to fix.


HTH,
Matthew

FLOSSHack One is launched!  I've posted URLs to the test VM and code, as well as
suggestions on what to look for:
  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/FLOSSHack_One


I plan on having two prizes awarded at the end of the competition:  one for the
person who finds the most vulnerabilities (not sure yet what the tie-break will
be), and one for the person who finds the "best" single vulnerability (as voted
on by participants).

If you find vulnerabilities throughout this week and want to be sure you get
credit for them please email me off-list with the details.  The first to report
a flaw will get credit.

Good luck!

FYI- I posted a couple of more tips on configuring the provided
virtual machine, in case anyone is struggling with GD support:

Anyone had a chance to peek at the code or fire up the VM yet?

Hi Folks,

For those who plan on joining FLOSSHack remotely, I'll need to know
your Google(+) username to send you an invite.  (I guess Hangouts are
limited to 9 guests, so if we hit a limit there, I'll work something
else out with gtalk/XMPP).  I will plan on posting the live video
stream link for the general public to have access to, but if you want
to chat with us or share your screen for a demo, I'll need to send you
the invite, so please email me that *off list*.

Thanks!
tim
