Message-ID: <CAN0o6cpx+X_55uUmWjdO-K6_+i5vU3UFUZsdLWHxTDhMT0Hg9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Unfortunately, our speaker this month's OWASP Portland chapter meeting has
come down with laryngitis so we're going to be showing a few of the talks
from this year's AppSecUSA conference with pizza. To vote on which talk you
would be interested in viewing go to this tweet:

Please register for the meeting on meetup so we know how many pizzas to
order: https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Portland-Chapter/events/256439702/

The meeting will be held from 6:00-8:00pm at Jama (135 SW Taylor St Suite
200).

Cheers!
David Quisenberry
