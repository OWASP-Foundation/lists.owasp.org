*Presentation - **Combating the Insider Threat*

Malicious attacks are up 87% over last year and insider threats still
remain as the leading cause of Data Breaches and IT sabotage.  The threat
is real, enough so that Federal agencies and Federal systems integrators
were required by Executive Order #13587 to implement an &#8220;Insider Threat
Detection and Prevention Program&#8221; by the end of 2013.  Yet traditional
Defense-in-depth methods fall flat to address the ever-present risk
inherent to unstructured data management.  Come learn what industry trends
as well as recent research from the FBI can teach us about securing our
security &#8220;soft center&#8221;.



Terry Boedeker, Solutions Engineer, Varonis Systems, has over 15 years of
experience in Information Technology ranging from software development,
technical writing, managed services and data center operations, to business
continuity program management, and information security.  He proudly served
in the United States Marines from 2003 to 2007, and graduated summe cum
laude from DeVry University in 2012, earning a B.S. in Networks &amp;
Communications Management.  He joined Varonis Systems in 2013, and
maintains the Certified Information Systems Security Professional
certification from (ISC)2.  For more details, visit
