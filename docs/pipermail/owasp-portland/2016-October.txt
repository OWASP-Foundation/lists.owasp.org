Hi everyone,

We have officially begun accepting registrations for our OWASP Training Day
2016, which will be held on Wednesday, November 2.  The official event page is
here:

And the registration page can be found here:

Note that each student can take one of two courses in the morning, and/or one of
two courses in the afternoon.  Each course costs just $25, so seats are likely
to fill up quickly.  Let me know if you run into any trouble registering.

Please help spread the word!

Best,
tim

Good news everyone!

We have released a few more seats for 2 classes in our training day:
 Cyber Hygiene - Critical Security Controls (3 seats left)
 Applied Physical Attacks on Embedded Systems (5 seats left)

Since the initial batch of seats were sold out in less than 48 hours, I suggest
you register ASAP if you're interested in these courses.

Hope to see you there,
tim
