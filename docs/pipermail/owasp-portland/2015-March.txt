Subject: [Owasp-portland] Security Program Manager job - iovation
Message-ID: <CAEwX-6+u3D4tZjC0O-NTQ7mBbB75yJ4QKrB5f_FMHFCLfhRBHQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm moving overseas, and iovation is keeping me on, but I need to train the
next Portland-based security program manager. There's also a referral bonus
if you find me someone.

Just a quick reminder that we have a chapter meeting tomorrow.  Brian
Ventura will be discussing SQRL, an authentication system designed to
replace passwords.  More info here:

New Relic will have pizza there, as always, and it is likely that some
of us will go get drinks afterward.

Hope to see you there!
