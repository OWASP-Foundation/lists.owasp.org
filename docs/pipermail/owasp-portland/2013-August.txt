Subject: [Owasp-portland] AppSecUSA - Early Registration Ends Soon
Message-ID: <20130813165550.GC2891@sentinelchicken.org>



Hi Portland OWASPers,

I'm not sure if the OWASP mothership has been spamming you with info
on this conference (coming up on November 18 in NYC), but I thought I
would mention that the early registration prices end in 2 days.  Info
here: http://2013.appsecusa.org/2013/

James and I will be at the conference this year, as we both feel it is
a great place to learn about the latest techniques and meet sharp
security professionals.  Is anyone else planning on attending?  If so,
maybe we could plan a little get-together for the Portland contingent
while we're there.

Cheers,
tim


PS- I'll be giving a talk (on XXE) and a training course 
(on Bletchley) for the conference, so look me up if you're coming.
