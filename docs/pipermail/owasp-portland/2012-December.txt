Don't forget, tomorrow's chapter meeting will be at 7pm.  There's a
reasonably high probability that the talk will be followed by a short
walk to a pub to enjoy each others' company.

Hope to see you there,
tim

Hi everyone,

At BSidesPDX I gave a talk on Bletchley, a practical cryptanalysis 
tool set that I've been working on.  It is now posted here:
  http://code.google.com/p/bletchley/

I would be thrilled to hear any feedback.         

Happy holidays,
tim
