<PRE>Hello everyone,

I appologize for taking so long to get this out.

We were hoping to find out what folks' preferences are for a variety
of items related to the Portland OWASP chapter.  I've included a short
list of questions below to get us started.  Please respond to myself
and/or AJ off-list so we don't clutter everyone's inboxes.  Of course
if you have any specific items you want to discuss with the group,
feel free to post back to the list.


Thanks!
tim


=============================

1. What topics related to application security or secure programming 
   practices would you be interested in hearing about?


2. What time of day would be most convenient for you to meet?
   (Note: for the forseeable future, meetings will likely be held
   downtown.)


3. What day of the week would be most convenient for you to meet?


4. Would you, or anyone you know, be interested in giving a talk at a
   future PDX OWASP meeting?  If so, on what topics?
</PRE>
