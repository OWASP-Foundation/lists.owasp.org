Subject: [Owasp-portland] First Portland OWASP Meeting August 12th @ 03:30pm
Message-ID: <648221400907241027y4b5f3b21p5baf09655e57095f@mail.gmail.com>

All,
     I've reserved some space downtown at the US Bank tower building on
Wednesday August 12th from 03:30pm-04:30pm. Though it's a little less time
than what you asked for to prepare some sort of talk, I'd like it if a
couple of you who offered could have something kinda light prepared. I'm not
expecting anything too serious but just want to get a meeting under our
belts. Also I'm not sure of the projector situation so if any of you have
one available that might be helpful. Thoughts?

Thanks,

AJ
