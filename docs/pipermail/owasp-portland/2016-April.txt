Subject: [OWASP-Portland] ISSA April Symposium: Web Application Security
Message-ID: <20160418165831.GG1250@sentinelchicken.org>


Hi OWASPers,

On Thursday there is a 1/2 day symposium on web application security
hosted by the local ISSA chapter.  I'll be one of the 4 speakers.
More info here:
  http://portland.issa.org/2016/chapter-meetings/april-symposium-web-application-security/

As a courtesy, the ISSA chapter has offered to allow any OWASP member
to sign up as an ISSA member for this event.  If you do take advantage
of this discount, just be sure to let them know you're from OWASP at
the door.

Cheers,
tim

Our next chapter meeting will be held at New Relic where Scott Davis
will be speaking on "Scanning APIs with OAS 2.0 (Swagger)".  Anyone
who has worked with REST or SOAP APIs should find it interesting.
More info here:

We are working on getting a June chapter meeting set up as well.  If
anyone has other topics they would like to propose for July or August
meetings I'm all ears.

Thanks,
tim
