<PRE>Welcome to 2018. I can see the days getting longer and I am enjoying the 
sun while it lasts, here in mid-February. I completed my coursework, 
obtaining my GIAC GCIH in January. That gave me time to build a 
new-to-me bicycle and tinker on my old Land Cruiser a bit. Those are my 
other hobbies.


Are you looking for your next challenge? Maybe some of these will peak 
your interest.


    CISSP


  * James Trumper and my CISSP course this past Fall was a great
    success! Our community now has more certified professionals. 

  * The&#160;official ISC2 CISSP study guide is provided to ISSA members at a
    50% discount!&#160;This is the book we use in the course and the official
    ISC2 study guide. Contact Ashley Edwards at Wiley to receive the
    discounted price:&#160;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-portland">aedwards at wiley.com.</A> Promo Code: CSP50


    College Programs

  * In previous messages I have touted *Mt. Hood Community College's
    (MHCC)* 2-year program in Information Security. The only Oregon
    2-year. cybersecurity program recognized by Department of Homeland
    Security (DHS). Now other local schools are getting into the game.
  * *PCC* is actively pursuing their DHS 2-year Certification, look for
    more information coming in their Fall offerings. 

  * *Oregon Information Technology (OIT) *is also pursuing their DHS
    Certification, but for their 4-year program! OIT collaborates with
    MHCC already and will with PCC as well to provide a 2+2
    cybersecurity program, or OIT will provide all 4 years for students.

These schools obtaining certified cybersecurity programs exemplify the 
need our industry has for more trained professionals.


    Local Trainers and Conferences


  * *SANS* has a *Security Essentials Bootcamp* coming in June. I am
    teaching the course. This is *SEC401:
    <A HREF="https://www.sans.org/community/event/sec401-portland-jun-2018.*">https://www.sans.org/community/event/sec401-portland-jun-2018.*</A> This
    is a 6-day intensive, hands-on Information Security course. Come
    join me.
  * Last year, Charlie Kawasaki and his daughter provided a summer camp
    for high school students focused on Information Security. The name
    changed to *NW Cyber Camp*, but they are coming back this year
    again: *<A HREF="https://www.nwcyber.camp*.">https://www.nwcyber.camp*.</A> Check them out and spread the
    word please.
  * The Portland OWASP chapter is working on their annual training day.
    This happens in early October. If you are interested in
    participating as a*trainer or sponsor*, please let the OWASP
    Leadership team know.
  * *Interface Portland 2018* is coming next month:
    <A HREF="https://f2fevents.com/event/pdx18/.">https://f2fevents.com/event/pdx18/.</A> Every year there are some good
    nuggets at this local conference. 



    Opportunities to help

  * OWASP Portland is always looking for *good presentations* for our
    membership. You may be doing something amazing, novel, or
    interesting that others want to hear about. This is a growth
    potential for you and a learning opportunity for the rest of the
    membership. Let me know if you are interested in sharing.
  * *Opportunity to teach*. Each year, James Trumper and I have provided
    a local CISSP course. If you are interested in helping with that
    effort, let us know. Having a pool of instructors will benefit our
    membership and provide you with a career building opportunity.
  * *Mentorship*. Interested in a mentorship program. It needs local
    leaders to help organize. Having a mentor helps us to learn how to
    get to the next level, how to improve professionally and how to give
    back to our community. If you are interested in mentorship, either
    as a mentor or a mentee, let me know and we will work to get the
    program working locally.


Happy 2018! Stay warm and I look forward to seeing you at the next event!
