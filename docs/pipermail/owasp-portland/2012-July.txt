Hi all,

we were having trouble with the google hangout, so we've fallen back
to IRC:

freenode / #flosshack

We are, however, streaming live video as well:

I'll also be updating the event wiki page periodically:

Message-ID: <20120703011813.GX30716@sentinelchicken.org>


Hey all,

Just wanted to drop a quick note to thank everyone who helped out with
this event.  I just sent off a preliminary list of vulnerabilities and
other findings to Ushahidi.  We found a total of 14 vulnerabilities.
Not bad at all considering there were about 9 of us on site (with two
Ushahidi developers joining remotely) and most folks didn't start
looking for issues until they arrived on Sunday.

I do plan on sending out all vulnerability details to all
participants, but I would like to give Ushahidi a bit of time to start
digesting the findings and get back to us with any feedback on them so
I can flesh out any technical details that I'm currently missing. For
those who did find flaws, you may be contacted directly with questions
about your findings.

Also, I should mention this FLOSSHack's prize winners!  The prizes
were $15 gift certificates for http://www.zerodayclothing.com/.  
(I know, it isn't the biggest incentive in the world, but I hope
future prizes will be more motivating.)  The prize for "best bug" will
go to Michael Freeman while the the prize for "most bugs" will go to
Kees Cook.  (I'll contact you guys once I get them in the mail.)


Thanks again and great work.

Yes, although I don't do a lot of development these days.

I'd say make it their priority. It should be added cred for them having a CISSP
on staff; maybe nobody ever asks them about their security credentials? 
Or, do it for yourself. Every job I've held in the last dozen years or so
has either required or desired it.

Depending on your background, self-study should not consume a huge amount of
time, and I recommend that route - the prep courses are expensive and cover
what I'd consider the basics, if you have a few years of real experience.
If the test is offered again locally some time a ways out, there's likely to be a study group leading up to it you could join.

You can claim credit for chapter meetings as long as there's a security topic discussed - so ISACA and ISSA meetings locally would count, too.

Hi folks,

I've spoken with some people from Ushahidi and they appreciate the
work that went into the FLOSSHack - thanks to everyone that
participated.  A few of them will be in town next week for OSCON and
wanted to connect with the local community.  They are planning a
casual meet up next Friday (July 20th).  Time and location are still
getting sorted out but the meetup page is
http://www.meetup.com/Ushahidi-Community/ and you're invited.  If you
know people who came to the FLOSSHack but aren't on this list please
forward this on.

Cheers,

Wil

The issues were sent to the Ushahidi team who is digesting them and
fixing them.  I expect them to come out on security.ushahidi.com as
the fixes come out in the code.

And after that, I will be sure to follow up with the full details of
all flaws found.  

Keep in mind that these issues are very real vulnerabilities in an
application deployed in the real world by third-parties.  A
responsible disclosure process typically involves keeping details of
flaws under wraps at least until patches are released.  While
FLOSSHack is a semi-public event, I certainly don't want to post all
of the vulnerability details on this mailing list yet.  Besides, it's
just a lot easier for me to wait on sending since the info on a lot of
flaws will continue to evolve.
