While there?s plenty of information about how to run a software engineering internship, the same can?t be said for security internships. In this talk I?ll discuss how security internships differ from regular software engineering internships, how to find interns, and how to structure internships to set up both your organization and the intern(s) for success.

She?s done 5 internships over the course of her undergraduate career and is currently doing her sixth with New Relic?s Product Security Team in Portland. She is also the co-founder of StarCon, a technology conference focused on the joy of technology and building a community around sharing technical knowledge.

> >

Lint is considered to be one of the first tools to analyze source code and this year marks its 40th anniversary. Even though it wasn't explicitly searching for security vulnerabilities back then, it did flag suspicious constructs. Today there are a myriad of tools to choose from both open source and commercial. We did a comparative analysis of scanners specifically focused on web application vulnerabilities. We then turned our attention to finding additional ways to aggregate and correlate data from other sources such as git logs, code complexity analyzers and even a roster of students who completed a secure coding class. We wanted to go beyond just triaging in isolation the vulnerable code snippets reported by the SAST scanners. People write the code so why not use these added data features in an attempt to build a predictive vulnerability model if possible. We are not there yet but learned many things along the way.

We need people to contribute intentionally vulnerable code snippets in as many programming languages as possible. Furthermore, we encourage folks to scan this project's repository and upload the results so others can review them for their SAST needs.
