Subject: [OWASP-Portland] May chapter meeting 5/22 6 PM @ Jama Software - a
 panel discussing "Pen Testing: How to Get Bigger Bang for your Buck"
Message-ID: <CA+0m=FeVHgrN3zBbfYk2sWqb+TYGFVAZ-rViQbpfcgx_WRBEKA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The May chapter meeting is 5/22 at 6 PM at Jama Software, 135 SW Taylor
Suite 200, Portland, Oregon 97204

A panel will take on the subject of "Pen Testing: How to Get Bigger Bang
for your Buck", including your questions:

Panel Discussion - Join local industry practitioners as they discuss the
best practices used in getting superior results from your Pen Testing. Also
share your ideas on Dos and Dont's of Pen testing.

Moderator - Brian Ventura

Panelists - Alexie Kojenov, Ian Melven, Benny Zhao, and Scott Cutler

Alexei Kojenov is a Senior Application Security Consultant with years of
prior software development experience. During his career with IBM, he
gradually moved from writing code to breaking code. Since late 2016, Alexei
has been working as a consultant at Aspect Security, helping businesses
identify and fix vulnerabilities and design secure applications. Aspect
Security was recently acquired by Ernst&Young and joined EY Advisory
cybersecurity practice.

Ian Melven is Principal Security Engineer at New Relic. He has worked in
security for almost 20 years, including roles at Mozilla, Adobe, McAfee and
@stake.

Benny Zhao is a Security Engineer at Jive Software. His experience focuses
on identifying code vulnerabilities and securing software by building tools
to help automate security testing.

Scott Cutler has been interested in computer security since he was a kid,
and started attending DefCon in 2004. He got his Computer Science degree
from UC Irvine in 2009 while working for the on-campus residential network
department for 4 years. After graduating he worked first as QA for a SAN
NIC card manufacturer, then switched to essentially create their DevOps
program from scratch. From these jobs he has gained a lot of experience
with networking, build processes, Linux/Unix administration and scripting,
and Python development. In 2012 Scott began working in the security field
full time as a FIPS, Common Criteria, and PCI Open Protocol evaluator for
InfoGard Laboratories (now UL Transaction Security). During this time he
got his OSCP and a good understanding of federal security requirements,
assessment processes, and documentation (ask him about NIST SPs!). In 2015
scott switched over to Aspect Security (now EY) to put his OSCP to good use
and became a full-time application security engineer, doing pen-tests as
well as developing both internal and external training.

Nice work Ian, Brian, Philip, Bhushan and Benny in pulling this off.  It
sure looked like a lot of coordination went into putting this together.

Thanks.

Subject: [OWASP-Portland] May meeting - Monday 6/18 6 pm @ WebMD - "Machine
 Learning vs Cryptocoin Miners" presented by Jonn Callahan
Message-ID: <CA+0m=FcriDLKBRecownB_FUoc=g8UN-+68j90z7iN0kWmAyoEg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

The May meeting will be on Monday, June 18, 2018 at 6 pm, hosted by WebMD

The topic will be "Machine Learning vs Cryptocoin Miners" presented by Jonn
Callahan

*Machine Learning vs Cryptocoin Miners Description*: With the advent of
cryptocurrencies as a prevalent economic entity, attackers have begun
turning compromised boxes and environments into cash via cryptocoin mining.
This has given rise for the opportunity to detect compromised environments
by analyzing network traffic logs for evidence of cryptocoin miners.
Specifically, I'll be reviewing various ML and statistical analysis
techniques leveraged against VPC Flow Logs. This talk will not be a deep
dive of the math involved but instead a general discussion of these
techniques and why I chose them.

*Speaker's Bio*: Jonn Callahan is a principal appsec consultant at nVisium.
Jonn was previously heavily involved in the OWASP DC and NoVA chapters. He
has been working in appsec for half a decade now, initially within the DoD
and now commercially with many high-visibility companies. Recently, Jonn
has been digging into ML to find ways to bridge it and the security
industry in an intelligent and usable fashion.

Also, if folks are looking to get more involved in Portland OWASP or help
out, please get in touch - we have a planning meeting coming up soon and
are working on this year's Training Day as well as upcoming chapter
meetings and could always use more help!

thanks,
ian
