<PRE>I've received just two responses to this posting.  I'm pretty sure more
people than that are interested, considering how many eyes I've seen
light up when I describe it, but I think it is important to get more
input on the types of applications people would be interested in auditing.

Early April is also getting pretty busy for me, so if I don't get some
more feedback, I'll probably postpone this until May where I can get the
word out to more audiences.

cheers,
tim

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to those were able to make it to our meeting last week.  We had
</I>&gt;<i> about 10-11 attendees plus our speaker and a couple of his friends, so
</I>&gt;<i> it was a solid turn out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Next on my radar is to flesh out this idea I've been wanting to try out.
</I>&gt;<i>  In the interest of having a catchy name, I'm calling it &quot;FLOSSHack&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (for Free/Libre Open Source Software Hacking).  Feel free to suggest a
</I>&gt;<i> catchier name.  Here's the gist of it:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Gather together folks who are interested in getting down and dirty in
</I>&gt;<i> technical details to sharpen their penetration testing and security code
</I>&gt;<i> review skills.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Select a FLOSS application that people are interested in testing.
</I>&gt;<i> Let people work on their own for a week or so before a meeting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Sit down together to discover and discuss as many vulnerabilities as
</I>&gt;<i> possible that were found in the application.  Discuss secific
</I>&gt;<i> exploitation scenarios and mitigation strategies. Openly share all of
</I>&gt;<i> the results of testing within the group (but avoid sharing publicly just
</I>&gt;<i> yet).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Work with the developer of the software to address the issues through
</I>&gt;<i> a responsible disclosure process.  Those who discover bugs get full
</I>&gt;<i> public credit for the issues they find (if they wish) and experience in
</I>&gt;<i> responsible notification and interaction with software maintainers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I expect there will be a number of details to work out, but I would like
</I>&gt;<i> to take a quick poll on a few things.  If you don't mind taking a couple
</I>&gt;<i> of minutes to answer these questions (sent back to the list,
</I>&gt;<i> preferably), that would be great:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A. Would you be interested in participating in such an event?
</I>&gt;<i>    If &quot;no&quot;, stop here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> B. What kinds of vulnerabilities are you most interested in learning
</I>&gt;<i>    about? (e.g. SQL injection, buffer overflows, XXE, ...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> C. What technologies/development platforms are you most experienced
</I>&gt;<i>    with?  What technologies/development platforms are you most
</I>&gt;<i>    interested in learning more about?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> D. Do you have suggestions for what open source projects you would like
</I>&gt;<i>    to perform an audit of?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> E. Will a FLOSSHack session on April 10 or 11 work for your schedule?
