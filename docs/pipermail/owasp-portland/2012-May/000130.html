<PRE>When they approached Michael for help he found a couple problems
(sounded like CSRF) and told them how to fix them but it sounds like
there is a lot of surface area left.  Aside from just finding actual
security holes, they aren't following recommendations like
implementing HTTPOnly flags and STS.  In the unlikely scenario we
didn't find anything we could talk about how to add those things to an
app and why they are important.

Regarding a test environment, you could download the open source
package or you could let them host the map stuff - the mozilla site I
linked to earlier is using their hosted option.  On the other hand, I
did a quick google search and found
<A HREF="https://github.com/ushahidi/virtual-machines">https://github.com/ushahidi/virtual-machines</A> which someone else
apparently already made :)

I'm downloading it over hotel wi-fi right now so it'll be a while
(500mb) but if no one else gets there first I'll send an update on how
it goes.

Cheers,

Wil
