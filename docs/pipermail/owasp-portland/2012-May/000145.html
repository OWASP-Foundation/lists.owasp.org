<PRE>I'm checking into using a classroom at our college.  Got the blessing
from IT and they would be willing to setup a dedicated 10MB circuit for
this. I just need facilities to give the OK.

One question I was asked is if we have insurance.

</I>&gt;<i> getting a few companies to pony up a few bucks a month shouldn't be

</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Hi Wil,
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; The options they were looking at to allow groups to use the
</I>&gt;<i>         space in
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; the evenings/weekends for a reduced rate didn't pass the
</I>&gt;<i>         board vote so
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; that is out.  As a member, I can sponsor 2 hours of meeting
</I>&gt;<i>         time this
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; month for the OWASP meeting, anything over that hits the
</I>&gt;<i>         regular
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; $35/hour rate.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; That's great to know about for future meetings with
</I>&gt;<i>         Collective Agency.  Thanks
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; for following up with that.  We could either find a sponsor
</I>&gt;<i>         for the meeting to
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; extend it to 4 hours for a very reasonable $70, or just have
</I>&gt;<i>         it elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Anyone think their company would jump at the chance to
</I>&gt;<i>         sponsor it?
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; I know we were talking about a longer get together so
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; I'm not sure if that'll work or not.  Timothy, did you
</I>&gt;<i>         investigate
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; getting any funds from OWASP?
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; I did read up on chapter funding, and besides the method
</I>&gt;<i>         we've been using so far
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; (having sponsors for individual meetings) it looks like we
</I>&gt;<i>         can either start
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; encouraging paid memberships or looking for local companies
</I>&gt;<i>         to sponsor us on an
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; annual basis.  I could probably ask the OWASP board for
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;start up&quot; funds of some
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; sort, since we're a young chapter, but chances are they're
</I>&gt;<i>         going to come back at
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; some point with strong with encouragement to start asking
</I>&gt;<i>         people to join as
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; $50/year members.  (Going this route doesn't mean everyone
</I>&gt;<i>         must pay to join
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; meetings.  It just means we'd be pestering you all the time,
</I>&gt;<i>         OPB-style, to pony
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; up. =)  If you guys are cool with that, I'm fine with it as
</I>&gt;<i>         well, but I had
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; initially hoped to establish a strong attendance and regular
</I>&gt;<i>         meetings before
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; going there.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; For FLOSSHack, I'm kind of interested in trying out
</I>&gt;<i>         FreeGeek.  We haven't had a
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; meeting there yet, and it seems it could accommodate quite a
</I>&gt;<i>         few people, even if
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; folks do get a bit spread out through the building.  (That
</I>&gt;<i>         may actually be OK
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; for this kind of event, as folks might want to be heads-down
</I>&gt;<i>         hacking now and
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; then with less interruption.)
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; Regarding Ushahidi, it sounds like they've been making
</I>&gt;<i>         progress with
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; their security group.  Some details are at
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Security+Working">http://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Security+Working</A>
</I>&gt;<i>         +Group including
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; the submission process (emailing them).  Security issues
</I>&gt;<i>         are published
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; publicly at <A HREF="http://security.ushahidi.com/">http://security.ushahidi.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Great!  I'm glad they are getting organized about their
</I>&gt;<i>         security posture.  Makes
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; reporting issues much easier.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; I'm still figuring out if they'd like to be present (live
</I>&gt;<i>         or virtual)
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; at our meeting but I think the next steps here are to
</I>&gt;<i>         determine where
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; and when we want to do this and how many people will show
</I>&gt;<i>         up.  Towards
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; that end, I think scheduling online last time had good
</I>&gt;<i>         feedback, so I
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; made a link we can schedule with:
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://www.doodle.com/mu3486diwmrarpb4">http://www.doodle.com/mu3486diwmrarpb4</A>
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Great.  I wanted to do this, but hadn't got around to it.  I
</I>&gt;<i>         think based on the
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; replies I received to the &quot;weeknight vs. weekend&quot; question,
</I>&gt;<i>         the majority of
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; people preferred doing it on a weekend.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; The most important consideration, though, is scheduling with
</I>&gt;<i>         our venue.  If we
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; do go with FreeGeek, Sundays would probably be best based on
</I>&gt;<i>         what Paul told me
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; off-list.  Collective Agency probably has a bit more
</I>&gt;<i>         flexibility on this.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Unfortunately my schedule this month has become totally
</I>&gt;<i>         crazy and I will be out
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; of town for a lot of it.  I've added the weekend days I can
</I>&gt;<i>         do to the doodle
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; page (which are May 19 &amp; 20, or June 2 &amp; 3).  Doing the 2nd
</I>&gt;<i>         and 3rd is probably
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; safest from a planning perspective, but I also don't want to
</I>&gt;<i>         steal any thunder
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; from the meeting we have on the 10th.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; It's tough to find a good day so I threw some variety in
</I>&gt;<i>         there but
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; it's by no means official - if everyone can find another
</I>&gt;<i>         good day or
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; you want me to add one to the list just let me know, I just
</I>&gt;<i>         wanted to
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; get the ball rolling.  We talked about meeting for 2-4
</I>&gt;<i>         hours in an
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; evening, so figure 6pm or so on whatever day?
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; I'm fine with doing it later in the day on the weekend, but
</I>&gt;<i>         earlier works too.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Earlier might be better on a Sunday.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; Also, did anyone else play with the virtual machine?  Any
</I>&gt;<i>         trouble
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;&gt; getting it up and running?
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; No time yet. =(  I'm sure it won't be too tough to throw
</I>&gt;<i>         together though.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Thanks for keeping the ball rolling!
