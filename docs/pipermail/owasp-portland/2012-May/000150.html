<PRE>List,

This might be a little off topic but for those who are working in the
information security field or are going interested in the field it sounds
like an interesting opportunity to hear from law enforcement and the FBI
are concerned about in the security space.

As Chair of the Citizens&#8217; Crime Commission and a fellow PGE employee, I

cyber threats to business.  Please pass this along to your peers *at other
companies* who might benefit from a high-level introduction to this topic

This is not a technical presentation for online security professionals as
much as it is a heads up to the general business community about the need
to protect their businesses from electronic threats.****

This is a sponsored event (no charge) but a reservation is required.
Please see below for details.  *Contact Suzanne Hayden with the Citizens&#8217;

Put down that spy novel, the Cold War is not over; it has merely moved into
a new arena: the global marketplace. Every year, billions of U.S. dollars
are lost to foreign and domestic sources who deliberately target economic
intelligence in flourishing U.S. industries and technologies. Are you aware
of how economic intelligence is gathered through cyber intrusions that may
be difficult to detect? Are you or your employees unwitting participants in
these attacks? How can you be sure?****

 ****

At the Citizens Crime Commission's upcoming Public Safety Spotlight, *Oregon
FBI Special Agent in Charge, Greg Fowler,* will provide a high-level
briefing of why businesses are targeted and how. Attendees will receive a
local threat assessment specifically developed for Oregon and Washington
business executives informed by actual cases. The presentation will feature
a panel discussion with executives from local companies on lessons learned.

*Upcoming topics in the series:*****

* *****

*Police &amp; Community in Crisis: Calling 911 for Mental Health Treatment*****

City of Portland 911 receives close to a million calls each year in
Multnomah County and more than 400,000 of those calls send a police
officer. Only 30,000 of those calls result in an arrest, yet each year an
average of 1,000 involuntary holds are placed on persons deemed a danger to
themselves or others due to their mental illness. That&#8217;s nearly three per
day. This public safety spotlight event brings into sharp focus the
challenges faced by police officers when community mental health options
and support disappear. *Portland Police Chief Mike Reese* discusses this
alarming trend and the increasing impact on our public safety resources.
The *Citizens Crime Commission Mental Health Task Force* will present
findings illuminating the need for more coordination and information
sharing in order to support both police and persons in mental health
crisis. ****

 ****

*Governor&#8217;s Public Safety Commission; What is the ROI for Prison Beds?*****

*Chief Justice De Muniz* leads a panel discussion on the findings of the
Governor&#8217;s Public Safety Commission and the challenges ahead for the
state. While we are experiencing falling crime rates, general fund
expenditures for the Department of Corrections are increasing, driven by
ballot measures and  legislation mandating longer prison sentences. At the
same time, state revenue shortfalls are reducing funding for schools and
social services. Can we achieve less crime and improve public safety
without building more prisons? How do we invest our public safety dollars
to achieve better outcomes of less crime at a lower cost?****

 ****

*These events are brought to you due to the generous sponsorship of
businesses who support **
public safety in our community.*****
