<PRE>Download finished!  I had to tweak some settings to get the virtualbox
working on OS X (yay ipv6) but it wasn't anything too complex.  It
works as expected - I can load the site and poke around.  I just used
'ushahidi' as the password for everything and it worked - everything
else is in the README that comes with it and they have docs on their
website.

We should probably pull in the latest released code in the VM before
we start to play with it to make sure we're hitting the latest stuff.

Did anyone else try the VM?  Anyone have problems?  We could get
everyone trying to get the VM going this week (or next week), then a
week of playing, and then meet the week after?

If people aren't familiar with VMs this is a good chance to learn too.
 The package I linked to is just a virtualbox image (virtualbox is
free and cross platform - an excellent VM host).

Cheers,

Wil
