<PRE>I didn't know we had a meeting scheduled for the 10th.  Maybe we could
use that meeting to remind people about this and do the FLOSSHack a
couple weeks afterwards (giving time for people to set up the VM).  I
scheduled it close in just because otherwise it might get put off
forever but bumping to mid-late June could be a good idea.

&gt;<i> Hi Wil,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The options they were looking at to allow groups to use the space in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the evenings/weekends for a reduced rate didn't pass the board vote so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is out. &#160;As a member, I can sponsor 2 hours of meeting time this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> month for the OWASP meeting, anything over that hits the regular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $35/hour rate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's great to know about for future meetings with Collective Agency. &#160;Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> for following up with that. &#160;We could either find a sponsor for the meeting to
</I>&gt;<i> extend it to 4 hours for a very reasonable $70, or just have it elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone think their company would jump at the chance to sponsor it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I know we were talking about a longer get together so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure if that'll work or not. &#160;Timothy, did you investigate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting any funds from OWASP?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did read up on chapter funding, and besides the method we've been using so far
</I>&gt;<i> (having sponsors for individual meetings) it looks like we can either start
</I>&gt;<i> encouraging paid memberships or looking for local companies to sponsor us on an
</I>&gt;<i> annual basis. &#160;I could probably ask the OWASP board for &quot;start up&quot; funds of some
</I>&gt;<i> sort, since we're a young chapter, but chances are they're going to come back at
</I>&gt;<i> some point with strong with encouragement to start asking people to join as
</I>&gt;<i> $50/year members. &#160;(Going this route doesn't mean everyone must pay to join
</I>&gt;<i> meetings. &#160;It just means we'd be pestering you all the time, OPB-style, to pony
</I>&gt;<i> up. =) &#160;If you guys are cool with that, I'm fine with it as well, but I had
</I>&gt;<i> initially hoped to establish a strong attendance and regular meetings before
</I>&gt;<i> going there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For FLOSSHack, I'm kind of interested in trying out FreeGeek. &#160;We haven't had a
</I>&gt;<i> meeting there yet, and it seems it could accommodate quite a few people, even if
</I>&gt;<i> folks do get a bit spread out through the building. &#160;(That may actually be OK
</I>&gt;<i> for this kind of event, as folks might want to be heads-down hacking now and
</I>&gt;<i> then with less interruption.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding Ushahidi, it sounds like they've been making progress with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their security group. &#160;Some details are at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Security+Working+Group">http://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Security+Working+Group</A> including
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the submission process (emailing them). &#160;Security issues are published
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> publicly at <A HREF="http://security.ushahidi.com/">http://security.ushahidi.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great! &#160;I'm glad they are getting organized about their security posture. &#160;Makes
</I>&gt;<i> reporting issues much easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm still figuring out if they'd like to be present (live or virtual)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at our meeting but I think the next steps here are to determine where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and when we want to do this and how many people will show up. &#160;Towards
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that end, I think scheduling online last time had good feedback, so I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> made a link we can schedule with:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.doodle.com/mu3486diwmrarpb4">http://www.doodle.com/mu3486diwmrarpb4</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great. &#160;I wanted to do this, but hadn't got around to it. &#160;I think based on the
</I>&gt;<i> replies I received to the &quot;weeknight vs. weekend&quot; question, the majority of
</I>&gt;<i> people preferred doing it on a weekend.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The most important consideration, though, is scheduling with our venue. &#160;If we
</I>&gt;<i> do go with FreeGeek, Sundays would probably be best based on what Paul told me
</I>&gt;<i> off-list. &#160;Collective Agency probably has a bit more flexibility on this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately my schedule this month has become totally crazy and I will be out
</I>&gt;<i> of town for a lot of it. &#160;I've added the weekend days I can do to the doodle
</I>&gt;<i> page (which are May 19 &amp; 20, or June 2 &amp; 3). &#160;Doing the 2nd and 3rd is probably
</I>&gt;<i> safest from a planning perspective, but I also don't want to steal any thunder
</I>&gt;<i> from the meeting we have on the 10th.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's tough to find a good day so I threw some variety in there but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's by no means official - if everyone can find another good day or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you want me to add one to the list just let me know, I just wanted to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get the ball rolling. &#160;We talked about meeting for 2-4 hours in an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evening, so figure 6pm or so on whatever day?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm fine with doing it later in the day on the weekend, but earlier works too.
</I>&gt;<i> Earlier might be better on a Sunday.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, did anyone else play with the virtual machine? &#160;Any trouble
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting it up and running?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No time yet. =( &#160;I'm sure it won't be too tough to throw together though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for keeping the ball rolling!
</I>&gt;<i> tim
