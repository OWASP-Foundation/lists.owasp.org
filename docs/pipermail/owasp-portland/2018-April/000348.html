<PRE>Join SANS Instructors Brian Ventura and Derek Hill for an evening of 
conversation regarding Secure configurations - Built-in Security 
Enhancementsand the benefit of the CISSP certification from a hiring 
manager perspective.


*TOPICS*
1. In the information security news, we regularly hear about the latest 
vulnerabilities with recommendations to scramble and patch immediately. 
This is an important aspect of our industry, however there are other 
security considerations. Are there configurations we can set now in our 
systems and software that will protect us? Let's explore secure 
configurations and see what we find.

2. The Hiring Manager is looking at your resume &#8211; why does CISSP matter? 
While the CISSP is not the only thing we look at, it is a great starting 
point. What knowledge does the CISSP provide and how does one prepare 
for the exam?

*Who is Brian Ventura:* Brian Ventura is an Information Security 
Architect by day and SANS instructor by night. Brian volunteers with the 
Portland ISSA and OWASP chapters, focusing on educational opportunities. 
For SANS, he regularly teaches CyberDefense courses like the CIS 
Controls, Risk Management, and Security Essentials. Brian has a Security 
Essentials (SEC401) course in Portland, June 18-23. Come join in the 
learning experience!

*Who is Derek Hill? *Derek Hill has over 25 years of experience in IT 
and Information Security. He currently manages an Application Security 
Team, an Infrastructure Security Team (Blue Team) and a Data Privacy 
Engineering team at HP Inc. in Vancouver, WA. His teams are responsible 
for ensuring that HP&#8217;s internally developed applications are secure as 
well as the AWS infrastructure that is hosting these applications.&#160; 
Prior to his current position, Derek held IT management and technical 
roles at both large and small companies.&#160; In each role, he has focused 
on delivering excellent services, uptime and security for all the
