</I>&gt;<i> *&#8220;How to Work a Room&#8221; Basic Networking Skills*
</I>&gt;<i> *Helping individuals achieve their personal goals by teaching and coaching
</I>&gt;<i> effective networking*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Intro by OWASP Toronto:*
</I>&gt;<i> *As AppSec and information security professionals, we work in a field
</I>&gt;<i> where technical knowledge is key, while networking and communications
</I>&gt;<i> skills, which are just as important, are often overlooked. Marcel's
</I>&gt;<i> insights on effective networking will help you be more successful in your
</I>&gt;<i> roles within your organizations, or help you be better prepared to enter
</I>&gt;<i> the security workforce.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Speaker: Marcel Gagnier*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Marcel is a successful sales technology executive with over 20 years
</I>&gt;<i> experence in sales and account management. He owes his success primarily to
</I>&gt;<i> his networking skills.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Networking has allowed Marcel to develop relationships, and business, and
</I>&gt;<i> to support a wide range of interests as well as lifelong friendships.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As with many people networking did not come easily to Marcel. It is a
</I>&gt;<i> learned skill that he first developed while in the British Army starting
</I>&gt;<i> with human intelligence (HUMINT) on operations. These skills became further
</I>&gt;<i> refined when conducting threat assessments and social engineering. These
</I>&gt;<i> networking skills allowed Marcel to easily transition into the civilian
</I>&gt;<i> world in a variety of roles and in both small and large firms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Marcel will share his insights in a workshop called &#8220;How to Work a Room&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> where basic networking skills will be covered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You will learn the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - The basics of networking - how it works
</I>&gt;<i>    - What events to attend and what events not to attend
</I>&gt;<i>    - How to research the event and attendees
</I>&gt;<i>    - Setting event goals
</I>&gt;<i>    - What to wear
</I>&gt;<i>    - What to carry
</I>&gt;<i>    - When to arrive
</I>&gt;<i>    - How to read the room
</I>&gt;<i>    - How to engage the best prospects
</I>&gt;<i>    - How to make an introduction
</I>&gt;<i>    - How to engage in conversation
</I>&gt;<i>    - How to exchange contacts and business cards
</I>&gt;<i>    - How to disengage
</I>&gt;<i>    - How to follow-up
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
