&lt;<A HREF="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/owasp-toronto-september-2014-tickets-12733754001">https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/owasp-toronto-september-2014-tickets-12733754001</A>&gt;

*Date/Time: September 10, 2014, 6:30 - 8:30 PM EDTLocation: Suite 500, 257
Adelaide St. W., Toronto, ON*

*Speaker:*

*Ryan Berg*

Ryan is the Chief Security Officer at Sonatype. Before joining Sonatype,
Ryan was a co-founder and chief scientist for Ounce Labs which was acquired
by IBM in 2009. Ryan holds multiple patents and is a popular speaker,
instructor and author, in the fields of security, risk management, and
secure application development. Prior to Ounce Labs, Ryan co-founded Qiave
Technologies, a pioneer in kernel-level security, which later sold to
WatchGuard Technologies in 2000. In the late 1990's, Ryan also designed and
developed the infrastructure for GTE Internetworking/Genuity's
appliance-based managed security services.


*Session Outline:*

*What's Hiding in Your Software Components? Hidden Risks of Component-Based
Software Development &#8211; Seeing the Forest Through the Trees*
Software is no longer written, it's assembled. With 80% of a typical
application now being assembled from components, it's time to take a hard
look at the new risks posed by this type of development -- and the
processes and tools that we'll need in order to keep them in check. Join
Ryan Berg as he shares real world data on component risks, outlines the
scope of the problem, and proposes approaches for managing these risks.
You'll learn how security professionals can work cooperatively with
application developers to reduce risk AND boost developer efficiency.

---
Looking forward to seeing you all.

Regards,
Yuk Fai
