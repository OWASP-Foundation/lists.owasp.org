Subject: [Owasp-toronto] location and agenda
Message-ID: <7274FE6068F1DE49B8AA0258E92C5A3C01BF128A@shasta.foundstone.com>

Hi All,

 

In an attempt to get the first meeting for our Toronto Chapter started,
I am trying to get location and agenda suggestions. 

 

I would like to have volunteers speak and/or suggest the topic and
others can speak about the topics. The topics preferably have to stick
with security. 

 

All suggestions welcome.

 

Thanks

Nish.
