Hello everyone!

I am happy to kick off the new year with our next OWASP Toronto chapter
event!

We will be doing something new - the OWASP Toronto team will host a guided
discussion on entering the world of AppSec / Security.

As usual, space is limited, so please confirm your attendance on our Meetup
event page <https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/246663547>!

Cheers,
Yuk Fai
