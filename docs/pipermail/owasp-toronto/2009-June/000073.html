<PRE>Hi All,

Our 3rd meeting for this year is coming up next week. &#8220;Doug Simpson&#8221; from Cenzic is going to present on Beyond &#8220;Fuzzy&#8221; Metrics:  Why You Need Quantifiable Metrics to Measure Risk.

Hope you can attend this session, please RSVP to the address below
Location: 4-179B, 121 King Street West, Toronto&lt;<A HREF="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=121+King+Street+West,+Toronto&amp;sll=43.649973,-79.37798&amp;sspn=0.006785,0.018797&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=43.647908,-79.383473&amp;spn=0.01357,0.037594&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=addr">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=121+King+Street+West,+Toronto&amp;sll=43.649973,-79.37798&amp;sspn=0.006785,0.018797&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=43.647908,-79.383473&amp;spn=0.01357,0.037594&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=addr</A>&gt; (same as last time)
Date/Time: June 10th, 2009, 6:00-7:30 PM EST
Title: Beyond &#8220;Fuzzy&#8221; Metrics:  Why You Need Quantifiable Metrics to Measure Risk
Description and Bio:  In these economic times, hard numbers are needed to justify any kind of expense.  And spending for Web application security is no exception.   To make a business case for risk management that will resonate with upper management, you need a standardized platform that is built on a quantifiable (algorithm-based) measuring system.  The traditional use of &#8220;fuzzy&#8221; metrics such as &#8220;high, medium and low&#8221; to define a company&#8217;s risk level is antiquated, and not an accurate way to assess risk to any Web application.
Join Douglas Simpson, CISSP, Senior Security Engineer from Cenzic, Inc. as he discusses the benefits of a quantifiable risk metric, including how it (1) helps prioritize what needs fixing, (2) gives visibility into where the biggest risks reside within the organization, and (3) allows for easier adjustment to fit the environment.
In this session, you&#8217;ll also learn:
&#8226;

The good, the bad and the ugly of the today&#8217;s security risk metrics,
&#8226;       The importance of measuring Web security risk with an algorithm-based metric, and

Where to begin.  .
Presenter: Dough Simpson

Thanks
