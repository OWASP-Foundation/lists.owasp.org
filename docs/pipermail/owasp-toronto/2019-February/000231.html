*Web Application Cyber Range*

Want to test your skills in identifying web app vulnerabilities? Join OWASP
Toronto and Security Innovation as members compete in CMD+CTRL, a web

learning quickly that attack and defense is all about thinking on your feet.

For each vulnerability you uncover, you are awarded points. Climb the
interactive leaderboard for a chance to win fantastic prizes! CMD+CTRL is
ideal for development teams to train and develop skills, but anyone
involved in keeping your organization&#8217;s data secure can play - from
developers and managers and even CISOs.

In addition to signing up on the meetup page, you can also register at
Security Innovation's page to receive helpful tips, FAQs, and access to
cheat sheets:
