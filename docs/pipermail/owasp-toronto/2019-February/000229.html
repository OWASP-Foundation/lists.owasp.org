<PRE>Hello everyone,

We're pleased to announce this month's OWASP Toronto chapter event.

Sincerely,

*Date/Time*: February 20, 2019, 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM EST
*Location*: Room 128, St. James Campus - Building A, George Brown College,
200 King Street East, Toronto, ON, M5A 3W8
*Event page*: <A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/258798951/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/258798951/</A>

*In Root we trust (no this is not a DNS talk)*

*Abstract*

What do airplanes, TSA pre-check, credit cards, Windows Updates, and HTTPS
all have in common? They all rely on the use of digital certificates as a
basis for the security they provide.

In this talk Pavan and Lisa will share their expertise on what a digital
certificate is, what they can be used for, and why we trust them (or not
trust them in some cases...). They will cover the fundamentals of Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) and shed light on the critical role that Root
Certification Authorities (CAs) play in all of our lives.

This talk is aimed at those who are onboard for HTTPS everywhere but want
to dive into the nuts and bolts of how certificates work and understand the
broader applications of PKI.


*Speaker Bios:*

Pavan

Pavan is a Manager with Deloitte&#8217;s Cyber Risk Advisory practice and has
performed and led advisory work across a wide variety of domains with a
focus on network security, vulnerability management, and data protection.

Recently, Pavan&#8217;s focus has shifted to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and
the Certification Authorities (CAs) that issue publicly trusted TLS
certificates. He has performed audits of both public and enterprise CAs and
has been an official witness to several root key generation ceremonies both
in Canada and internationally.

While not on an engagement, Pavan attempts to stay up to date on the latest
memes by dedicating his time to mentoring youth at his local Air Cadet
Squadron

Lisa

Lisa is a consultant in Deloitte&#8217;s Risk Advisory practice. Her specialties
include trust considerations of Public Key Infrastructure, Cyber Security,
Enterprise Risk, Internal Controls, Third Party Service Auditor Reporting,
Data Quality, Confidentiality and Privacy. Furthermore, she is involved in
the development and delivery of training courses within the practice, and
internal innovation initiatives.

In her spare time, Lisa is involved with a variety of charitable and not
for profit organizations and initiatives. Lisa is a member of Deloitte&#8217;s
United Way Campaign Committee, SickKids Campaign Committee and Advisor for
the Junior Achievement Business Program. She previously led a Canada-Wide
not-for-profit, Science Expo, and is currently in the process of developing
her next passion project focused on youth education.
