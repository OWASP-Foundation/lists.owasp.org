Subject: [Owasp-toronto] OWASP Toronto - January 2016 Event
Message-ID: <CAO9ySDHkY1HLrRh6UiOk8rm9vji85fgFO2S6jhJVUFgRrfcRFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

Happy New Year! We will be having our next chapter event on January 20.
Michael Bennett will be sharing his thoughts on application-level DDoS and
how to defend against them.

Note that space is limited, so please RSVP here
<http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/227847887/> if you wish to
attend!

*Date/Time: January 20, 2016, 6:00 - 8:00 PM EST*
*Location: Suite 500, 257 Adelaide St. W., Toronto, ON*

Speaker:
Michael Bennet
Lead DDoS Strike Developer, Security Compass

*Is your Application DDoS Ready?*
*Common issues that leave your application DDoS defences vulnerable*

More and more DDoS attacks are targeting the Application Layer in order to
knock your sites and services offline. These attacks need far less
horsepower to drive results and often target weaknesses in an application
and its defences in order to be effective. While there are solutions
available to protect your application, they can only do so much and often
are misconfigured for an application. In this presentation I?ll talk about
common misconfigurations that we come across during our DDoS testing, as
well as some web application design considerations that help some DDoS
defences to be more effective.
