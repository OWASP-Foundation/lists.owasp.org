<PRE>Hi Everyone,

SecTor has been kind enough to open the floor to the security community.

To get access only to the Expo floor you can register on the site. See below the instructions on how to do so.

Hopefully you have also registered for one or more of their training sessions, if not please do the seats are pretty much all gone.

Hope to see you all there.

Nish.
