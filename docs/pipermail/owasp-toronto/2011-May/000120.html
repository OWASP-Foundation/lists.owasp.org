<PRE>Hello everyone,

We have so far received a great level of interest for next week's speaking event, and a lot of you have RSVP'ed already!

This is why we looked for a bigger venue to accommodate everyone who wants to attend. I'm happy to announce that RBC has graciously offered an auditorium for this month's OWASP event, which will fit a lot more people!

So, if you are planning to attend, please take note of the *new* location and time below. It's is accessible by TTC (King or Spadina streecars), and it's within walking distance of Union Station.

Finally, as a reminder, if you plan to attend, please RSVP at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-toronto">yukfai at securitycompass.com</A>&lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-toronto">yukfai at securitycompass.com</A>&gt; to confirm your presence.

Date/Time: May 11th, 2011, 5:00-6:00 PM EST
Location: Auditorium C, 315 Front Street West, Toronto, ON M5V 3A4&lt;<A HREF="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=315+Front+Street+West,+Toronto,+Ontario,+Canada">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=315+Front+Street+West,+Toronto,+Ontario,+Canada</A>&gt;
Speaker: Max Veytsman
Title: Mobile Security for the Forgetful

You've accidentally misplaced your company or personal mobile phone in a public location. In this scenario, what threats do you and/or your organization face?

This talk will be about the worst case scenario in mobile security: when the attacker has physical access to the phone. According to DataLossDB, about 1/5 of all data breaches they have recorded are due to lost or stolen laptops. Phones are much easier to lose (or steal) then laptops, and these days the data on our phones can be as confidential as the data on our laptops.

This talk will go over physical access attacks from an attacker's perspective, discuss ways of coding mobile applications to defend against these kinds of attacks, and discuss some ways of securing our phones as users. Technical details in this talk will focus on the Android platform.

Length: 60 minutes
