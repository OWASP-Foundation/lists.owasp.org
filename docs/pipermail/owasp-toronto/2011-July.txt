Hello everyone,

As a reminder, SecTor 2011 will be held in Toronto at the MTCC on October 18-19, with training on the 17th. The first round of speakers have been announced!

OWASP members can use the IND-OWASP-2011 discount code to receive a 10% off the registration price.

In addition, the OWASP-Expo2011 discount code is also available to OWASP members. This code provides a discount off the registration fee for the Expo access, which provides people unable to attend the full conference free access to the exhibitor show floor, LockPick Village, SecTor Enterprise Lab and SecTor pre-function space.

Best regards,

Yuk Fai Chan
