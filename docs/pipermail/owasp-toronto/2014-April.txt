Subject: [Owasp-toronto] OWASP Toronto - April 2014 Event
Message-ID: <CAO9ySDEvz=fNNCSL6tKv5McspV1iQ_Z30nyW_p7Zp=Dsyei5fg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

We are please to announce our next chapter event!

Please RSVP at yuk.fai.chan at owasp.org to confirm you presence. This is
important as it helps us plan the logistics for the event.

---

*Date/Time: April 23, 2014, 5:30 - 7:30 PM EDT*
*Location: Downtown Toronto TBD*

*Session Outline:*

Heartbleed! or Heart Bleed! The logo, the media coverage, the virus (no
wait, it's not a virus); reverse Heartbleed and client Heartbleed (the
transfusion) - a tale of failure to validate inputs, trusting user-provided
input and coding around good security. You've read the book! Seen the
movie! Now see the live puppet show*. (*puppets not included, please bring
your own batteries too).

*Speaker: Ben Sapiro*

Ben works for KPMG where he advises people on Cyber Security (we're not
entirely sure what that is yet either but we hear it's the 'new infosec'
which is the 'new orange' which is the 'new black'). He's also the founder
of OpenCERT, a BSidesTO organizer, LiquidMatrix Podcaster, SECTOR Fail
Panelist and occasional writer of things (which sometimes includes horrible
code and bad prose). With 15 years in the biz, Ben's hoping for parole
soon; otherwise is going to have to find something else to do in
infosec/cybersec besides product management, SecSDLC, consulting,
insulting, and CISO'ing. Ben has advised a whole bunch of confidential
clients on AppSec and Secure SDLC, but two he _can_ talk about (when
reliving the glory days) are Sybase and Motorola.

---
This event will be attended by members of OWASP Toronto, CIPS Toronto, and
ISC2 Toronto.

Looking forward to seeing you all.

Regards,
Yuk Fai

Hi everyone,

Thank you all for your interest in the April 23 event!

Due to the overwhelming response and limited capacity at the venue,
registration is now closed.

For those of you who have sent a RSVP and have received a reply from me, we
look forward to seeing you on Wednesday.

For those who are unable to attend, do not worry, we will be recording the

Regards,
Yuk Fai
