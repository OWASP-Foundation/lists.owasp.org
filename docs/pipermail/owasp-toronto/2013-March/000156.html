<PRE>Hello everyone,

I am finally happy to announce our next chapter meeting!

Please note the new location details. *Due to fire and building
regulations, there is a maximum occupancy allowed in the venue, so if you
would like to attend it is very important that you RSVP at
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-toronto">yuk.fai.chan at owasp.org</A> to confirm your presence!*

-----

*Date/Time*: March 20th, 2013, 6:30 - 8:30 PM EST
*Location*: PwC Tower, 18 York Street, Suite 2600, Toronto ON M5J 0B2

*Session 1: Summary of HP 2012 Cyber Risk Report*
Presenter: Subu Ramanathan, Security Compass

Subu will be presenting a summary of the HP 2012 Cyber Risk Report, which
amongst other topics covers the vulnerability landscape of web and mobile
applications.

*Session 2: NFC Village*
Presenter: Geoff Vaughan, Security Compass

NFC technologies are used in many widespread commercial applications. In
some cases, attackers are taking advantage of the few security features
have been implemented. Security Compass is currently developing an NFC
village for use at future conferences. Come try out our mock NFC village to
learn about NFC technologies and see for yourself what personal data is
being stored on the cards. There will be many opportunities to experiment
with NFC and tons of tags available to scan and manipulate. Bring your NFC
enabled phone ( Android / Blackberry) as you will have an opportunity to
scan tags for prizes.

*Before you come:*
There are many NFC apps available for Android devices (and a few for
Blackberry). We have reviewed a number of them, and for the purpose of this
lab, we will be demoing TagWritter and SquareLess for Android. In order for
you to get the most out of the NFC village, you may consider installing
these apps in advance (or any other comparable one). You will also need to
make sure that you have NFC enabled on your device.


Looking forward to seeing you all.

Best regards,
Yuk Fai
