<PRE>Hi everyone,

This is a reminder that we are having our next chapter event on March 20th.

Please note that the speakers have had to modify their agenda - there will
still be a presentation on NFC, but the hands-on component will be for
another time.

Again, if you would like to attend it is very important that you *RSVP at
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-toronto">yuk.fai.chan at owasp.org</A> to confirm your presence*! There is a maximum
occupancy allowed in the venue.

-----

*Date/Time*: March 20th, 2013, 6:30 - 8:30 PM EST
*Location*: PwC Tower, 18 York Street, Suite 2600, Toronto ON M5J 0B2

*Session 1: Summary of HP 2012 Cyber Risk Report*
Presenter: Subu Ramanathan, Security Compass

Subu will be presenting a summary of the HP 2012 Cyber Risk Report, which
amongst other topics covers the vulnerability landscape of web and mobile
applications.

*Session 2: NFC Threat Landscape*
Presenter: Geoff Vaughan, Security Compass

Near Field Communication is on pace to be one of the most explosive
technologies in North America for 2013. Over 2012 we&#8217;ve seen a number of
industry steps to making this a reality. Nearly all phone makers are
putting NFC into all new phones they develop. Over the last year we have
also seen widespread adoption by a large number of financial institutions
to put NFC into all their new credit cards and banking cards as well as
many mobile payment systems now accepting the technology. At this point we
need to take a step back and evaluate the implications of having NFC always
enabled on a consumer phone and the implications of storing mobile payment
data on an individuals phone. NFC technologies are intimately embedded into
all core features of a smart phone and this presents a very large attack
and vulnerability surface for an attacker to potentially exploit.


Looking forward to seeing you all.
