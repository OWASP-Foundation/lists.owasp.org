*Date/Time*: June 13, 2017, 6:00 PM to 8 PM EDT
*Location*: Suite 500, 257 Adelaide St. W., Toronto, ON
*Event page*: <A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/240436834/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/240436834/</A>

*Description:*

*The Node.js Highway: Attacks Are At Full Throttle*

Node.js is the drive-and-go language and its popularity is soaring. Five
years after its debut, and the language&#8217;s framework boasts more 2M
downloads a month. Before accelerating too quickly, it is important to
understand the power &#8211; and corresponding mishaps &#8211; of this language.  In
this talk, we demonstrate new attack techniques against applications built
on top of the Node.js language.  Attacks include:

   - Application-layer DDoS attacks. Bringing a server to its knees with
   just 4(!) requests.
   - Password exposure attacks. Leveraging the &#8220;Forgot My Password&#8221; feature
   of applications in order to reveal the passwords of all the application&#8217;s
   users
   - Business logic attacks. Running malicious code on all machines of
   users of the applications when exploiting a weak business feature.


*Presenter Bio:*

*Susan St.Clair, CWAPT*
*Solution Engineer &#8211; Checkmarx*

Susan currently works with organizations to help implement secure coding
practices as part of their SDLC as part of the Checkmarx GTA team.  She has
over 15 years of experience working with application teams in the software
industry.

She was previously a product manager and solution engineer with Codiscope,
now part of Synopsys.
