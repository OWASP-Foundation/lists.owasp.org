Title: Open source plugins - Exploit Me 
Description: Testing for certain web application vulnerabilities is
tedious and time-consuming, and when combined with time constraints,
full testing coverage is often not achieved. ExploitMe is a series of
Open Source Firefox plugins released by Security Compass for this
purpose - automated detection of XSS, SQL Injection, and access control
(including the recently released HTTP verb tampering) vulnerabilities. 
In this presentation Tom Aratyn and Sahba Kazerooni of Security Compass
will demonstrate how the Exploit-Me series of tools can be used during
penetration testing to find security vulnerabilities in real web
applications. 
Presenters: Tom Aratyn (Developer ExploitMe Series), Sahba Kazerooni
(Security Consultant, Security Compass) .
If you are at Infosec Canada next week, please ping me if you would like
to meet up for drinks on Thursday the 12th evening.
Regards,
Nish.
