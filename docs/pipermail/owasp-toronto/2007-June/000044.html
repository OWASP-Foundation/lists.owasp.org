<PRE>Hi All,

 

We have our next OWASP meeting coming up. Fortify Software is coming in to
speak on &quot;Incorporating security into the SDLC&quot;. 

 

The meeting will be held on June 21st at a 20-79 Wellington Street West,
Toronto, ON M5K 1B9.

 

The BIO of the speaker will be posted on the chapter website
(<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Toronto">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Toronto</A>) in the next couple of days.

 

 

Please send your OWASP attendance RSVP to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-toronto">owasp-rsvp at securitycompass.com</A> if
you would like to show up without RSVP, you are still welcome.

 

Look forward to meeting all of you.

 

Nish.

 

I also wanted to let you know that Infosec Canada is going to be held on
