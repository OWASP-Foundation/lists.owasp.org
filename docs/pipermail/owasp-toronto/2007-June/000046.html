<PRE>Hi,

 

I wanted to let you know that our speakers from Fortify can not make it
today. However, Reza will be speaking today instead.

 

Here are the details of today's' meeting:

 

Location:

20the floor, 79 Wellington Street West, Toronto, ON M5K 1B9

 

Time:

6:00 PM

 

Presenter:

Reza Kopaee

 

Topic:

Application Security At the Enterprise Level 

Application Security At the Enterprise Level 

The benefit of conducting and managing business via the Internet is
immeasurable.  However, the risk and threat of cyber attacks is real. This
often results in direct financial and reputation loss. Organizations
traditionally concentrate on general protection measures such as encryption,
access control, and network security. However, these general countermeasures
have proven to be inadequate in protecting Internet applications. 

The cost of securing a flawed application is far more expensive than
building it securely the first time around. To remain competitive,
organizations must understand and mitigate software security risks when they
acquire, outsource, implement or host applications. This pressure stems from
customer, business partner, and employee expectations of trust, as well as
stringent security and privacy regulations. 

This session will highlight the elements of secure software, and explain how
organizations can effectively acquire, integrate, outsource, develop,
assess, and manage secure software by:

.       Aligning software security with business objectives and enterprise
security policies 
.       Identifying threats and mitigating controls 
.       Integrating security with enterprise processes such as SDLC, PMLC,
and quality assurance 
.       Assessing the security posture of enterprise applications 
.       Managing application security risks within the enterprise 
.       Implementing privacy compliant software  

Presenter profile
Reza Kopaee is a senior manager in Deloitte's Enterprise Risk services. He
leads the web application security and quality practice. Reza assists
organizations across various industries in reviewing and building security
capabilities into their critical software and the supporting processes.
