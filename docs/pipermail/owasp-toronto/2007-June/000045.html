<PRE>Hi Everyone,

The next chapter meeting will be held on June 21st at 6:00 PM at 20the
floor, 79 Wellington Street West, Toronto, ON M5K 1B9 . 


Topic: Incorporating security into the SDLC 

Description: Incorporating security into the SDLC has been the subject of
academic studies for years. However, as hacking has evolved from a
hobbyist's sport to organized professionals focused on monetization,
enterprises have been forced to take concerted countermeasures. Banks, often
the target of cyber attacks, have set an example for responsible security
strategies by adopting SDLCs that shift from a reactive response to the
latest attack to the proactive development of software systems that are
among the most secure in today's world. How do the world's leading financial
institutions balance risk against the pressures of delivering software to
customers quickly? How are developers trained to write code securely? How
are software security tools, such as dynamic and static analysis, deployed
for optimal use? 

Presenters: 

Matt Rose, Senior Software Security Consultant 

Matt Rose has 10 years of software development experience that includes Sun,
Bea, and Plumtree Software. His development experience includes .NET (VB.NET
&amp; C#) as well as Java. Matt has lead SDLC implementations and development
projects onsite with clients across many industry verticals. These verticals
include but are not limited to Financial, Retail, Insurance, and Healthcare.



Randy Schmitz, District Manager 

Randy Schmitz has over 10 years experience in software sales. Randy has been
instrumental in creating awareness and sales in the New England States and
Eastern Canadian markets over the last 2 years. Prior to his experience at

Embarcadero Technologies supporting database and development tools sales.
