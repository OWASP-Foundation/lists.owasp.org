Title: How Auditors Certify Computer Systems - A Look at Third Party, Non-Vendor, Legally Mandated System Certifications

"Certifications" abound in the world of IT - from signoffs by internal security professionals to the advertising claims of vendors, but few, if any of these, have true legal standing.  As a consequence,  customers and clients of organizations which process sensitive transactions or retain confidential data are increasingly demanding third party, non-vendor, legally mandated system certification as a pre-requisite to doing business.


*         What are these certifications and who can issue them?

*         Under what circumstances are certifications likely to be required?

*         What standards do certifiers use - and does it matter?

*         What information and evidence do auditors need in order to complete their work?

*         How can information systems professionals prepare for a certification audit and ensure that the process is ultimately successful?

Our speaker, Jerrard Gaertner, CA*CISA/IT, CGEIT, CISSP, CIPP/IT, I.S.P., ITCP, CIA, CFI, Director of Technology Assurance Services at Soberman LLP, will address these and related questions based on his 25+ years as a systems auditor.


See you all there!
