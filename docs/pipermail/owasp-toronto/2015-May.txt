Hello everyone,

We are pleased to announced our next chapter event after our winter hiatus!
For this month, we will be organizing a panel discussion, rather than
having a formal speaker session, which will hopefully keep things
interesting and engaging!

Please RSVP here
<https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/owasp-toronto-may-2015-tickets-16870676648> to
confirm your presence. This is important as it helps us plan the logistics
for the event.

Also, if you are interested in joining the panel, please contact me at
yuk.fai.chan at owasp.org!

*Date/Time: May 20, 2014, 6:00 - 8:00 PM EDTLocation: Suite 500, 257
Adelaide St. W., Toronto, ON*




*Panel Discussion: State of Application Security in 2015We invite you to
join us at our next OWASP Toronto chapter meeting, where a panel of
industry professionals will discuss the state of application security in
2015. Panelists will share their point of view on a number of topics,
followed by an open discussion with the audience. Come prepared to learn,
discuss, share, and ask questions!*

   1. *Appsec Wishlist*: "If I could have one thing improved in application
   security in 2015, it would be ..."
   2. *Appsec Defenders*: Offensive Security is obviously thriving, but how
   are the Defenders doing? Has there been improvement? There are plenty of
   blackhat/red team rock stars, but are we giving enough credit to the blue
   teams?
   3. *Appsec Tools*: Which application security tools are doing the job
   right? Which ones can be further improved?
   4. *Evolution of Application Security Assessments*: How will the
   industry effect a sea change in attitude towards assessing software for
   security issues? The tunnel-vision model (i.e., black-box only, source code
   review only, configuration review only) is deficient, and the best approach
   is to overlap as many techniques as possible. Time-boxed approaches
   compound the problem, and with the increasing proliferation and complexity
   of applications in any given organization, scaling assessment services to
   all targets is bottlenecked.
   5. *Appsec Talent*: There are too few skilled/trained information
   security professionals, and too much work to do. Scaling up to meet the
   demand can only partially be managed through automation. Where will the
   next wave of reliable security professionals come from? Is training for
   information security skills too expensive in the age Code School? Is North
   Armerica in need of a CREST-like certification to establish a baseline
   level of coverage by a practitioner?
   6. *Internet of Things (IoT) & Appsec*: In the age of the Internet of
   Things (IoT), vendors continue to ship products that fail at meeting basic
   application security concepts - authentication, authorization, auditing;
   confidentiality, integrity, availability; resilience, failure modes, trust
   boundaries. How do we improve the general state of application security for
   IoT?

*Panelists*
To be announced shortly!

Looking forward to seeing and catching up with you all!

   of applications in any given organization, scaling assessment services to
   all targets is bottlenecked.
   5. *Appsec Talent*: There are too few skilled/trained information
   security professionals, and too much work to do. Scaling up to meet the
   demand can only partially be managed through automation. Where will the
   next wave of reliable security professionals come from? Is training for
   information security skills too expensive in the age Code School? Is North
   Armerica in need of a CREST-like certification to establish a baseline
   level of coverage by a practitioner?

To be announced at the event!

I am very excited about this panel discussion tomorrow - looking forward to
seeing you all!

Best,

Subject: [Owasp-toronto] hardwear.io - Hardware Security Conference Call for
	Papers
Message-ID: <CAMUeWmgje+0hAC6Xk27qwAqjz3YpKQ5Q46c9fbJnDGbjbR1zNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Hackers and Security Gurus,

hardwear is seeking innovative research on hardware security. If you
have done interesting research on attacks or mitigation on any
Hardware and want to showcase it to the security community, just
submit your research paper. Please find all the relevant details for
the submission below.

About hardwear.io
----------------------------
Somewhere in the mid of last year, amidst all the news and concerns
surrounding trust and backdoors in hardware equipment, Hardwear was
conceptualized to provide the IT and security community with a
platform to discuss and solve issues pertaining to hardware security.
The objective of the conference revolves around four key concerns in
hardware, firmware and related protocols i.e. backdoors, exploits,
trust and attacks (BETA).

Dates:
Training: 29th - 39th Sept 2015
Conference: 1-2nd Oct 2015

Venue:
The Hague, Netherlands

General Queries: antriksh at hardwear.io
CFP Queries:      cfp at hardwear.io


Topics
-----------
hardwear accepts papers on any topic that discusses in-depth hardware
and firmware security both from the offensive as well as defensive
perspective. Some of the topics of interest include (but not limited
to):

- Integrated Circuits
- Processors
- Internet of Things/Smart Devices
- Hardware crypto
- Embedded Systems
- Automobile, Aeroplane, train automation systems and hardware components

Categories
---------------------------
1. New Research (40 mins ? 1 hr) ? is a deep knowledge technical track
that includes new research, vulnerabilities, zero days or exploits.
And by new we really mean new i.e. if your research or talk has been
published/showcased before, it will fall under current research
category even though there are enhancements/changes to the original
research.

2. Current Research (30 mins ? 1 hr) ? comprises of known security
issues, new research presented/published elsewhere, case studies,
twist to an existing research, vulnerability, exploit or
research-in-progress.

3. Tool (30 mins ? 1 hr) ? Comprises of open source security tools,
exploits, hardware etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the
original authors to showcase their work to the world.

Brief Profile ( less than or equal to 500 Words)

Paper Abstract ? Please provide detailed working or your
research/work. The more details you provide the better it is for the
reviewers. Please keep the abstract to the point. Please do not try to
hide the technical details or say ?I can?t disclose it till bla bla?
as it does not help the reviewers in any way and may give your paper a
low score because of insufficient information available in the
abstract.
