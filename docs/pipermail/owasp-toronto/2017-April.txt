*How Billion Dollar Enterprises Manage Application Security at Scale -
Altaz Valani*

Security Compass recently completed a comprehensive research study by
surveying companies across multiple industries with the goal of discovering
how large, complex organizations address application security at scale.
The majority of respondents surveyed were multinational organizations who
reported annual earnings greater than $1 billion USD.  Through this new
research study, we have gleamed novel insights on how large organizations
manage application security at scale.  Through this presentation, we will
reveal aggregated insights, industry trends, and best practices that
illuminate how organizations are addressing application security at scale,
so that you may apply and compare these learnings to the state of
application security at your own organization.

*Altaz Valani is a Research Director at Security Compass responsible for
managing the overall research vision and team.  Prior to joining Security
Compass, Altaz was a Senior Research Director in the Application
Development Practice at Info-Tech Research Group providing IT managers,
directors, and senior managers with guidance and analysis around
application development ? including Agile, Cloud, Mobile, and the overall
SDLC.  His other past positions include Senior Manager at KPMG, and various
entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial positions where he worked side by side
with senior-level stakeholders at blue chip clients to drive business value
through software development.*



*Altaz enjoys coding, teaching, and the challenge of learning.  He received
his BEng in Computer Engineering from McMaster University, and his MBA from
the University of Western Ontario.*
