Hi folks,

Great to meet some of you last night!

I'm wondering if anyone has any great resources they could share to  
learn more about the WAF products out there. One area I'm interested  
in, besides the technology, is the business case for a WAF. We heard  
a little about the management overhead they bring, so I'm curious to  
see how WAF-adopters have justified the expense this brings, versus  
implementing other controls (like secure dev. methodology, etc.)

Cheers!
Dave.

In extension to last nights discussions surrounding Application Scanners
(great presentation by the way!), we all understood the importance of
implementing security into all stages of the software development life
cycle.  I just received the following information which may be of
interest to some.

SANS is pleased to announce the SANS Software Security Series 2007 for
application developers and security professionals will be in Toronto on
March 22-23! (http://www.sans.org/info/4561)

This special two-day event is packed with opportunities for developers
to learn how best to implement security measures during the software
development lifecycle. Join us for the ultimate in security training
designed specifically for developers and system administrators:

   SECURITY 519: WEB APPLICATION SECURITY WORKSHOP
   DAY 1 - 1:00PM-7:00PM
   DAY 2 - 9:30AM-7:00PM
   On the first afternoon and the second day we will be featuring our
   very popular SANS Security 519: Web Application Security Workshop for
   the deeply discounted tuition fee of $995!  This advanced, hands-on,
   action packed course covers the principles of securing Web
   applications and the common vulnerabilities that are leveraged by
   attackers as well as general defense techniques to protect against
   future attacks. By helping you to understand the attacks and
   mechanics of components that affect security of Web applications,
   this course enables you to properly defend your Web applications. For
   each of the common vulnerabilities, manual and automatic testing
   methodologies are covered to ensure you can reveal vulnerabilities
   in existing Web applications.

   WEB APPLICATION ATTACKS: HOW HACKERS BREAK IN AND WHAT YOU CAN DO TO
DEFEND YOURSELF
   DAY 1 - 9:30AM-12:00PM
   In the morning, SPI Dynamics will host a free workshop entitled Web
   Application Attacks: How Hackers Break In and What You Can Do To
   Defend Yourself. This short and informative program will walk you
   through numerous case studies demonstrating the risks posed by Web
   application security vulnerabilities. We will not only demonstrate
   the technical vulnerabilities themselves, but also walk through
   real-life scenarios where these vulnerabilities have been leveraged
   by attackers to compromise corporate networks. This workshop provides
   a great lead in for the more in-depth, hands on SANS Web Application
   Security Workshop which starts in the afternoon.

At noon join us for a complimentary lunch with SPI Dynamics as they host
an open discussion on Web application security trends followed by a
short demonstration of WebInspect!

  "No matter your organization's size, budget, or regulatory
  environment, SANS courses are the best security dollars you can
  spend." John Madick, ScriptPro

Don't forget to mark your calendar for March 22-23 in Toronto.  We also
have additional locations listed at the close of this note, and we will
be adding new cities in the next few weeks.

Hackers continue to target application vulnerabilities in their attacks,
so this security training should not be missed!  You will be able to
apply what you learn in the classroom immediately upon returning to
work.  So register today and we'll see you in class!

There is an interesting new certification for programmers organized by
SANS (http://www.sans-ssi.org/ssi_press.pdf).  It is by far still in
it's infancy and I am a bit skeptical with any new certifications.
However, it is backed up by a persuasive group and even OWASP's own Jeff
Williams had a positive comment.

- - - Press release snippet - - -

WASHINGTON, DC., March 26 - A coalition of major technology users and
vendors, organized by the
SANS Institute, today announced the first skills assessment and
certification examinations for
programming professionals to test their secure coding skills, find the
gaps, and, if they choose, gain
GIAC Secure Software Programmer (GSSP) status. The four examinations
each cover a specific
programming language suite: (1) C/C++, (2) Java/J2EE, (3) Perl/PHP, (4)
..NET/ASP, and are designed
to enable reliable measurements of technical proficiency and expertise
in identifying and correcting the
common programming errors that lead to security vulnerabilities. The
exams will be administered in
August in Washington DC on a pilot basis, and then will roll out
worldwide through the remainder of
2007.

Cheers,

Tak.
