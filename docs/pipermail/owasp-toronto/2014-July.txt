Hi all,

We are please to announce our next chapter event!

Please RSVP at yuk.fai.chan at owasp.org to confirm your presence. This is
important as it helps us plan the logistics for the event.

Also, please note the new venue below for this month's event.

*Date/Time: July 16, 2014, 6:00 - 8:00 PM EDTLocation: Suite 500, 257
Adelaide St. W., Toronto, ON*

*Speaker: *

Dr. Mark Shtern, CISSP, Postdoctoral Fellow at York University

*Session Outline:*

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are negatively impacting a
broad spectrum of industries as they are increasing in number,
sophistication, and cost. Researchers have noted that, when simple DDoS
attacks fail, the attackers take aim at the application layer and these
attacks become more prevalent. For example, in the first quarter of 2012,
Layer 7/Application layer attacks increased by 25% compared to the year
before. In the third quarter of 2013, the total number of layer 7 attacks
increased by 101% compared to 2012. As a result, application layer attacks
have been a growing concern for information technology security specialists.

I will present an adaptive management mechanism, which can correctly scale
applications, mitigate a DDoS attack, or both, based on an assessment of
the business value of workload. I will talk about the Cloud Efficiency (CE)
metric, a runtime metric that assesses how effectively an application uses
software-defined infrastructure. This is a business-driven metric that can
be leveraged to detect various resource-consumption attacks on
applications, including cost-of-service and low-and-slow DDoS attacks.

Looking forward to seeing you all.

Subject: [Owasp-toronto] Thanks again!

Hi folks,

Thanks again to Dr. Mark Shtern for making time to present his research on
application-layer denial of service issues.

Thank you, too, to Elizabeth and Rafaella for their most excellent
logistics work in our new venue. Note to the rest of you: Next time, bring
more of an appetite.

And finally, thank you to everyone who joined us this evening. I hope you
all took something away from the presentation and/or the networking session
afterwards. I certainly learned something: I'm still a spaz in social
settings -- should not be let out in civilized society!

Anyway, we'll be in touch again soon for the next session, likely towards
the end of August.

Enjoy the rest of your summer!

Regards,

Andre Rochefort
