<PRE>Hi,

A couple of house keeping items first:

We are still looking for additional speakers. If you would like to speak or
have a potential topic you would like to discuss please send me an email.

We are looking for additional participants, please bring your friends /
colleagues / bosses to these meetings. 

Additionally OWASP has revamped its portal to use media wiki. I have updated
the Toronto chapter page. It can be accessed by following this link
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Toronto.">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Toronto.</A> 

Please go ahead and create an account and start discussions. A topic I have
started there is 

August Meeting

We are going to hold the Toronto OWASP Chapter meeting on Wednesday, August
9th at 6:00 PM.
 
Our meeting is going to be held at:
 
D&amp;T, 20th floor, the TLC Room (signs will be provided on the floor)
TD Centre, TD Waterhouse Tower
79 Wellington Rd. W. Toronto
(same location as last time).
 
The Agenda for the meeting is:
 
6:00 - 6:10 : Registration and introductions
6:15 - 7:30 : Search Engine Hacking
Speaker : Nish Bhalla

Description of talk: Search engines such as Google and Yahoo are crucial to
regular use of the Internet. They are also indispensable tools for hackers
who can perform information gathering without ever visiting the victim site.
In this presentation Security Compass founder Nish Bhalla walks through
examples of how search engines could be used to aid hackers. 
 
Please do go ahead and send an RSVP at <A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-toronto">owasp-rsvp at securitycompass.com.</A> If
you would like to show up without RSVP, you are still welcome.
 
D&amp;T is providing snacks and drinks.
 
Look forward to meeting all of you.
 
Nish.

Nishchal Bhalla
Founder, Security Compass
