*Description:*

*The Node.js Highway: Attacks Are At Full Throttle*

Node.js is the drive-and-go language and its popularity is soaring. Five
years after its debut, and the language?s framework boasts more 2M
downloads a month. Before accelerating too quickly, it is important to
understand the power ? and corresponding mishaps ? of this language.  In
this talk, we demonstrate new attack techniques against applications built
on top of the Node.js language.  Attacks include:

   - Application-layer DDoS attacks. Bringing a server to its knees with
   just 4(!) requests.
   - Password exposure attacks. Leveraging the ?Forgot My Password? feature
   of applications in order to reveal the passwords of all the application?s
   users
   - Business logic attacks. Running malicious code on all machines of
   users of the applications when exploiting a weak business feature.
