<PRE>Hi everyone!

I'd like to announce our next OWASP Toronto chapter event. This month, we
are very fortunate to have the Project Leaders for OWASP SecurityRAT,
Daniel Kefer and Ren&#233; Reuter, join us to talk about their project.

As usual, space is limited, so please confirm your attendance on our Meetup
event pages (see links below).

Looking forward to seeing you all.

Best,
Yuk Fai

*Date/Time*: May 28, 2018, 6:00 PM to 8 PM EDT
*Location*: Suite 500, 257 Adelaide St. W., Toronto, ON
*Event page*: <A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/250811475/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/250811475/</A>

*OWASP SecurityRAT: Handling of Security Requirements in Software
Development Lifecycle*

The bigger the company you're working in, the more technologies and
methodologies used by development teams you are going to face. At the same
time, you want to address security risks in an appropriate, reliable and
traceable way for all of them.

After a short introduction of a unified process for handling security
requirements in a large company, the main part of the talk is going to
focus on a tool called SecurityRAT which we developed in order to support
and accelerate this process.


The goal of the tool is first to provide a list of relevant security
requirements according to properties of the developed software (e.g. type
of software, criticality), and afterwards to handle these in a mostly
automated way - integration with an issue tracker being used as a core
feature.

Work in progress (currently targeting mainly integration to other systems,
automated testing of requirements and reporting) as well as future plans
will form the last part of the talk.

*Speakers:*

*Daniel Kefer*
*OWASP SecurityRAT - Project Leader*

Daniel Kefer has been working in the application security field since 2007.
Having started as a penetration tester, he soon became passionate about
proactive security efforts and working closely with developers. Since 2011
he has been working for 1&amp;1 where he currently leads an internal
application security team supporting development teams with security
challenges of their work. With OWASP, he leads the SecurityRAT project and
contributes to the SAMM project.

*Ren&#233; Reuter*
*OWASP SecurityRAT - Project Leader*

Ren&#233; Reuter is a security engineer with over 6 years of experience in the
application security field. At Robert Bosch GmbH, he works as an IT
Security Consultant responsible for identifying vulnerabilities and design
flaws that may impact Robert Boschs' applications and infrastructure. Ren&#233;
holds a Master's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Applied
Sciences Karlsruhe.
