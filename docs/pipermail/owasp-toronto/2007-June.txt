Message-ID: <005001c7a851$a8dd4800$e501a8c0@test>

Hi Everyone,

The next chapter meeting will be held on June 21st at 6:00 PM at 20the
floor, 79 Wellington Street West, Toronto, ON M5K 1B9 . 


Topic: Incorporating security into the SDLC 

Description: Incorporating security into the SDLC has been the subject of
academic studies for years. However, as hacking has evolved from a
hobbyist's sport to organized professionals focused on monetization,
enterprises have been forced to take concerted countermeasures. Banks, often
the target of cyber attacks, have set an example for responsible security
strategies by adopting SDLCs that shift from a reactive response to the
latest attack to the proactive development of software systems that are
among the most secure in today's world. How do the world's leading financial
institutions balance risk against the pressures of delivering software to
customers quickly? How are developers trained to write code securely? How
are software security tools, such as dynamic and static analysis, deployed
for optimal use? 

Presenters: 

Matt Rose, Senior Software Security Consultant 

Matt Rose has 10 years of software development experience that includes Sun,
Bea, and Plumtree Software. His development experience includes .NET (VB.NET
& C#) as well as Java. Matt has lead SDLC implementations and development
projects onsite with clients across many industry verticals. These verticals
include but are not limited to Financial, Retail, Insurance, and Healthcare.



Randy Schmitz, District Manager 

Randy Schmitz has over 10 years experience in software sales. Randy has been
instrumental in creating awareness and sales in the New England States and
Eastern Canadian markets over the last 2 years. Prior to his experience at
Fortify Software, Randy also worked the same geographic region for
Embarcadero Technologies supporting database and development tools sales. 

 

OWASP Toronto chapter meetings are open to the public RSVP is requested by

Subject: [Owasp-toronto] OWASP June Meeting Today
Message-ID: <023301c7b40a$9554be20$e501a8c0@test>

Hi,

 

I wanted to let you know that our speakers from Fortify can not make it
today. However, Reza will be speaking today instead.

 

Here are the details of today's' meeting:

 

Location:

20the floor, 79 Wellington Street West, Toronto, ON M5K 1B9

 

Time:

6:00 PM

 

Presenter:

Reza Kopaee

 

Topic:

Application Security At the Enterprise Level 

Application Security At the Enterprise Level 

The benefit of conducting and managing business via the Internet is
immeasurable.  However, the risk and threat of cyber attacks is real. This
often results in direct financial and reputation loss. Organizations
traditionally concentrate on general protection measures such as encryption,
access control, and network security. However, these general countermeasures
have proven to be inadequate in protecting Internet applications. 

The cost of securing a flawed application is far more expensive than
building it securely the first time around. To remain competitive,
organizations must understand and mitigate software security risks when they
acquire, outsource, implement or host applications. This pressure stems from
customer, business partner, and employee expectations of trust, as well as
stringent security and privacy regulations. 

This session will highlight the elements of secure software, and explain how
organizations can effectively acquire, integrate, outsource, develop,
assess, and manage secure software by:

.       Aligning software security with business objectives and enterprise
security policies 
.       Identifying threats and mitigating controls 
.       Integrating security with enterprise processes such as SDLC, PMLC,
and quality assurance 
.       Assessing the security posture of enterprise applications 
.       Managing application security risks within the enterprise 
.       Implementing privacy compliant software  

Presenter profile
Reza Kopaee is a senior manager in Deloitte's Enterprise Risk services. He
leads the web application security and quality practice. Reza assists
organizations across various industries in reviewing and building security
capabilities into their critical software and the supporting processes.

Greetings All,

I spoke with Reza regarding this at the last meeting. Several of my
colleagues and I would love to regularly attend the OWASP meetings, however
they generally fall on the second Wednesday of the month. The second Tuesday
of the month is Patch Tuesday or Microsoft Tuesday and we all work
essentially 24 hours straight starting when those patches come out, at 1PM
EST on the Tuesday. This means that by the time the meeting rolls around
we're all exhausted. We're definitely interested in attending, but we were
wondering if the meetings could be permanently moved to a new date.

Thanks
Tyler Reguly

Hello All,

I am one of those colleagues that Tyler mentioned.  There are 5 or 6 of us
who would be interested in regularly attending OWASP meetings.  We are all
part of a vulnerability research team located in the downtown core and are
definitely interested in attending.

My personal preference would be for OWASP meetings to be on the 3rd Thursday
of every month.  This moves them away from patch Tuesday but still avoids
conflicts with TASK, which I know a lot of us also attend.  Sorry if this
seems selfish, but the second Wednesday of every month is not a great date
for security "practitioners" who work in Microsoft rich environments (or
whose clients do).

Regards,

Ross Barrett

I know the thought has been passed around before, but perhaps we should try
and occasionally co-brand the meeting with TASK and call it a "combined
TASK-OWASP" meeting on web application security. This might entice more
people to attend.
