<PRE>Hi,

A Very Happy New Year to you all. I hope it is very successful to all of
you.

We have the January meeting planned out and is going to be held on 22nd
Jan. 

We have also been lucky to have a few additional speakers lined up from
Jan-June. We are of course always looking for additional speakers. 

The Jan 22nd Meeting

We are going to hold the Toronto OWASP Chapter meeting on 22nd Jan at
6:00 PM.
 
Our meeting is going to be held at:
 
D&amp;T, 20th floor, the TLC Room (signs will be provided on the floor)
TD Centre, TD Waterhouse Tower
79 Wellington Rd. W. Toronto
(same location as last time). 
 
The Agenda for the meeting is:
 
6:00 - 6:10 : Registration and introductions
6:15 - 7:30 : Modern Trends in Network Fingerprinting
Speaker : Jay Graver and Ryan Poppa (nCircle)

Please do go ahead and send an RSVP at owasp-rsvp at
securitycompass.com.
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-toronto">http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-toronto</A>&gt;  If you would
like to show up without RSVP, you are still welcome. Please bring as
many people as you can we definitely need to grow our user group. This
will also help get more speakers even from outside Toronto.
 
Look forward to meeting all of you.
 
Nish.
