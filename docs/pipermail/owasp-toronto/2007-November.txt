Hi,

 

Security Compass is proud to announce the release of the first two tools
in its Exploit Me series of application penetration testing tools for
Mozilla FireFox: XSS-Me and SQL Inject-Me. 

 

Currently in their beta release stage, these open source (GPL v3)
FireFox plug-ins search through web applications for vulnerable visible
and hidden form fields to perform input validation attacks.  

 

We believe that these tools will be invaluable not only to penetration
testers and QA testers, but also to developers as a light-weight method
to check for common application security vulnerabilities during the
development process.  

 

Please visit http://www.securitycompass.com/ to download these plugins.


 

As the tool is still the beta stage, we appreciate feedback on existing
functionality, desired features, and bugs encountered. Please send any
feedback to tools at securitycompass.com and bugs to
bugs at securitycompass.com. 

 

 

Thank you for your interest and we hope you are able to benefit from
this new tool!

 

Kind regards,

 

 

Nish.
