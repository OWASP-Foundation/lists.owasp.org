*OWASP: Beyond the Top 10*

Join us as we take a guided tour through some of OWASPs lesser-known
projects -- present and future. For students and new entrants to the
application security profession, get practical advice on options for
building and honing your skills. Developers and administrators alike might
benefit from an overview of OWASPs projects for secure SDLC, source code
review, and vulnerability assessment and mitigation. The seasoned
professionals can engage in a lively discussion and critique of OWASP
projects in the pipeline, and how the community as a whole is tackling
security for the web, mobile, and beyond. An OWASP session featuring a
buffet of OWASP offerings and a potluck of alternatives and enhancements.

Your host for this session is Andre Rochefort, an infosec veteran and
lifelong computer geek. As a developer, a security auditor, and a loudmouth
conference heckler, Andre offers a wealth of experience and anecdotes, with
a generous helping of opinion. His day-to-day activities at TELUS include
source code analysis, vulnerability assessments and penetration tests, with
a  heavy focus on web and mobile application security.

Looking forward to seeing you all there,
Patrick Szeto
