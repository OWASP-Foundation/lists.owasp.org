Hi All TO OWASP members

I am writing to you as the new lead for the Toronto Chapter.  I have
recently joined and decided that I would have some relevant input into this
group as I am responsible for the Application Security offering for IBM.

I am interested in your feedback in what you are looking for from this
group, what you can contribute and any other related suggestions that you
see of value as we go forward.  I would also suggest you start finding out
who of your colleagues are interested and get them to sign up
(http://www.owasp.org/local/toronto.html).  We are looking to grow this
group, present at events and become a leading group in this space.

I have received a few emails from the list participants recently and will
respond once I have received more feedback.

I look forward to your responses.

Regards

Hi,

 I'd personally like to see 

1 - the technical detail and demos that of the various tools and
exploits.  I spend time discussing these things with developers and
product managers and showing samples of what I have been able to do with
their sites - I'd like to formalize that more.  More WebGoat/Scarab
tools

2 - comparison of the various frameworks for security - ISO17799 vs
CoBIT vs Privacy law etc.

3 - comparison/discussion of OSSTM and other methodologies and successes
with it and others

4 - might be good to start a newletter to provide a forum for chapter
members to provide articles on topics of interest - perhaps not for the
first meeting...

5 - Discussion of recent patch and virus experiences and successes
around them.  Did a member have a particularly effective tool/process in
place to combat the problem and can share it?

That's a start -- looking forward to the first meeting...


Derek

As a former employee of a Government department that still has a
vulnerable website, I feel it prudent to start any newly formed group
will a fundamental discussion on Secure Coding 101. Some possible topics
include:

Cross-Site Scripting
SQL Injection
Cookies
Sessions
Forms & User Input
Etc ...

Invariably public meetings like this will see some folks that could use
at least a refresher before delving deeper. Can't wait to see some
meetings starting!
