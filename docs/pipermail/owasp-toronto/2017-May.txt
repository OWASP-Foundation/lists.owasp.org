We?ll dive into some of our favorite application security challenges from
past Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions, including highlights from the
recent 2017 edition of NorthSec, the largest applied security competition
in North America. The challenges we?ll walk through were not only fun to
solve but have a demonstrable real-world impact drawing on subtle flaws
that lurk in many production applications. So bring your laptops and
strap-in, this talk will be interactive and at the end of the night we?ll
have a few challenges to take home with you.

*Optional: If you want to follow along on your laptop as Jamie goes over
the challenge walkthroughs, you will need at least VMware / Virtual Box to
run a virtual machine, 8 GB of free space, and a web proxy such as Burp
Suite or OWASP ZAP.*

Hi Eder,

Thanks for reaching out! At this point, we can only commit to having USB
drives containing the VM image at next Thursday's session. Since Jamie is
planning to include some highlights from this weekend's NorthSec CTF, some
time will be required to create the VM. However, we will let everyone know
if the image is ready ahead of time.

Cheers,
Yuk Fai
