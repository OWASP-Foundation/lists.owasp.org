Speaker: David Mirza

Title: Introducing Vega, a New Open Source Web Vulnerability Scanner

 

David will be presenting Vega, a new free and open source vulnerability
scanner for web applications developed by Subgraph, his Montreal-based
security startup.  Vega allows anyone to scan their web applications for
vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting or SQL injection. Written in
Java, Vega is cross-platform. It's also extensible, with a built-in
Javascript interpreter and API for custom module development. Vega also
includes an intercepting proxy for manual inspection of possible
vulnerabilities and penetration testing.

 

Speaker Bio:

 

David has over 10 years in the information security business. He started his
professional experience as a founding member of Security Focus, which was
acquired by Symantec in 2002. David also moderated the Bugtraq mailing list,
a historically important forum for discussion of security vulnerabilities,
for over four years. He has spoken at Black Hat, Can Sec West, AusCERT and
numerous other security conferences, as well as made contributions to books,
magazines and other publications. David also participated in a NIAC working
group on behalf of Symantec to develop the first version of the CVSS (Common
Vulnerability Scoring System) model and was an editor for IEEE Security &amp;
Privacy. His current obsession is building Subgraph, his information
security startup in Montr&#233;al.

 

We look forward to seeing you there!

 

Best regards,
