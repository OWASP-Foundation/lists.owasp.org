Date/Time: September 14th, 2011, 6:30 - 8:00 PM EDT

Speaker: David Mirza
Title: Introducing Vega, a New Open Source Web Vulnerability Scanner

David will be presenting Vega, a new free and open source vulnerability scanner for web applications developed by Subgraph, his Montreal-based security startup.  Vega allows anyone to scan their web applications for vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting or SQL injection. Written in Java, Vega is cross-platform. It's also extensible, with a built-in Javascript interpreter and API for custom module development. Vega also includes an intercepting proxy for manual inspection of possible vulnerabilities and penetration testing.

Speaker Bio:

David has over 10 years in the information security business. He started his professional experience as a founding member of Security Focus, which was acquired by Symantec in 2002. David also moderated the Bugtraq mailing list, a historically important forum for discussion of security vulnerabilities, for over four years. He has spoken at Black Hat, Can Sec West, AusCERT and numerous other security conferences, as well as made contributions to books, magazines and other publications. David also participated in a NIAC working group on behalf of Symantec to develop the first version of the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) model and was an editor for IEEE Security &amp; Privacy. His current obsession is building Subgraph, his information security startup in Montr&#233;al.

We look forward to seeing you there!

Yuk Fai Chan
