<PRE>Hi All,

 

The next chapter meeting will be held at 6:00 PM on April 29th 2008.

 

It will be held at the same location as last time around. 

 

D&amp;T, 20th floor (Room 20-004), the TLC Room (signs will be provided on
the floor)
TD Centre, TD Waterhouse Tower
79 Wellington Rd. W. Toronto
 
The Agenda for the meeting is:
 
6:00 - 6:10 : Registration and introductions
6:15 - 7:30 :  Building Your Own Web Spider
 
Speaker :  Tyler Reguly

Description: A discussion, rather than a presentation, around building a
web spider. Tyler will present some of the challenges and considerations
that must be addressed but I hope to open the floor to two-way
conversation and turn it into more of a round table. 

 

Speaker BIO: Tyler is a Security Research Engineer with nCircle Network
Security and holds a Diploma in Computer Systems Technology from
Fanshawe College. His current focus has been on Web Application
Security, however he has worked on various things in the past including
Reverse Engineering and OS X vulnerability detection. Prior to nCircle
he has dabbled in system administration and web design. 

 

Please do go ahead and send an RSVP at owasp-rsvp at
securitycompass.com.
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-toronto">http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-toronto</A>&gt;  If you would
like to show up without RSVP, you are still welcome. Please bring as
many people as you can we definitely need to grow our user group. This
will also help get more speakers even from outside Toronto.
 
Look forward to meeting all of you.
 
Nish.
