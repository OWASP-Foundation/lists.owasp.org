<PRE>Hello everyone,

I'd like to announce and share the following:


   1. September Chapter Event: Mobile Security Talks
   2. October Chapter Event: Azure Cloud Security Workshop
   3. SecTor 2018 (OWASP discount codes!)

-----

*1 - Mobile Security Talks*

I am excited to announce our September 17th OWASP Toronto chapter event - a
double feature on Mobile Security. Our speakers are : Ivan Rodriguez (&quot;iOS
App runtime manipulation&quot;) and Kristina Balaam (&quot;Auditing/Pen Testing
Android Apps&quot;).

Please note that we have a new venue for this month. Shopify has graciously
offered to host us at their 80 Spadina, Toronto office (a different one
than August).

As usual, space is limited, so please confirm your attendance on our Meetup
event pages (see links below).

*Date/Time*: Monday September 17, 2018, 6:00 PM to 8 PM EDT
*Location*: 80 Spadina Avenue, Toronto, ON
*Event page*: <A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/254415501/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/254415501/</A>

6-7 PM
*&quot;iOS App runtime manipulation&quot; with Ivan Rodriguez*

In this talk, we'll learn how to decrypt and extract an iOS application
from a device, and use reverse engineering techniques to manipulate the app
at runtime.

*Ivan Rodriguez is an Application Security Engineer at Shopify with a
mobile development background, currently working in application security.*


7-8PM
*&quot;Auditing/Pen Testing Android Apps&quot; with Kristina Balaam*

As our world becomes more dependent on mobile devices, it's important to
understand the risks we may unknowingly introduce to users through the
applications we build. In this talk, we'll cover general Android security
best practices, discuss tools for auditing your own applications to find
vulnerabilities, and resources for continued learning.

*Kristina is a Security Intelligence Engineer at Lookout where she reverse
engineers mobile malware. Prior to Lookout, she worked as an Application
Security Engineer at Shopify focusing mostly on Android mobile security.
Kristina graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science from McGill
University in 2012, and is currently pursuing a MSc. in Information
Security Engineering from the SANS Institute of Technology. She blogs about
computer security on Twitter, Instagram and Youtube under the handle
@chmodxx.*

I am very excited to announce our October OWASP Toronto chapter event,
which will be a hands-on Azure Security Workshop run by Tanya Janca, the
chapter lead of OWASP Ottawa!

specializing in application security; evangelizing software security and

Have you ever wondered how security is different &#8216;in the cloud&#8217;? Where do
you store your certificates? Your keys? Your connection strings? How can
you see what&#8217;s going on with your resources? How do you patch? Where can
you see your server configs other important information? How do you manage
an security incident? How do you even know that you&#8217;re having an incident?

This first half of this workshop will be a demo where the audience follows
along, the second part will be for audience members to build things and
secure them, in Azure.

Demo will include:

   - Complete Azure Security Centre walkthrough
   - Policy and compliance, including subscription coverage
   - Resource Security Hygiene
   - Azure Security Centre Recommendations (mitigation of one or more
   items, dependent on time)
   - Threat Protection, Alerts and Threats
   - Applying System Updates
   - Key Vault


*Audience Participation*
(people who do not have a laptop can follow along with the teacher)

   - Create a DevOps project, from scratch, and publish to the internet.
   (20-30 mins)
   - Turn on Security Centre (5 mins)
   - Check your security configurations and settings to ensure your new app
   is safe. (10 mins)
   - More as time permits.

   - A laptop running any modern operating system (Mac OS, Windows, Linux)
   - Modern web browser (Safari, Edge, Chrome, FireFox)
