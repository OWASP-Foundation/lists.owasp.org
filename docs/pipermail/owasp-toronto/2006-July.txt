Hi,

A couple of house keeping items first:

have a potential topic you would like to discuss please send me an email.

We are looking for additional participants, please bring your friends /

August Meeting

We are going to hold the Toronto OWASP Chapter meeting on Wednesday, August
9th at 6:00 PM.
 
Our meeting is going to be held at:
 
D&T, 20th floor, the TLC Room (signs will be provided on the floor)

(same location as last time).
 
The Agenda for the meeting is:
 
6:00 - 6:10 : Registration and introductions
6:15 - 7:30 : Search Engine Hacking
Speaker : Nish Bhalla

Description of talk: Search engines such as Google and Yahoo are crucial to
regular use of the Internet. They are also indispensable tools for hackers
who can perform information gathering without ever visiting the victim site.
In this presentation Security Compass founder Nish Bhalla walks through
examples of how search engines could be used to aid hackers. 
 
Please do go ahead and send an RSVP at owasp-rsvp at securitycompass.com. If
you would like to show up without RSVP, you are still welcome.

Look forward to meeting all of you.
 
Nish.
