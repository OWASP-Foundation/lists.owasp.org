*Date/Time*: November 14, 2018, 6:00 PM to 8 PM DST

*Sonatype DevSecOps Community Survey - Working Session*

Sonatype will be facilitating small group working sessions using data from
their 2018 DevSecOps Community Survey. See description below!

*DevOps is Security?s New Front Line*

As we embrace movements like CI, CD and Devops to cut down on release
cycles - and innovate faster, we as developers must also embrace the
reality that the risk landscape is too complex to leave ?security? to just
those with security in their title. Traditional methods do not cut it
anymore ? it?s time for DevSecOps.

In a recent 2018 DevSecOps Community report, where 2,076 IT professionals
were surveyed, 48% of respondents admitted that developers know application
security is important, but they don?t have the time to spend on it. Done
properly, DevSecOps practices shouldn?t interrupt the DevOps pipeline - but
instead aid it - preventing costly rebuilds and build breaks, down the road.

Attendees of this session will walk away with:

   - Real-world examples of how large and small companies are implementing
   DevSecOps practices in their own delivery pipelines, and increasing
   developer awareness to risks
   - Key insights from 2,076 of their peers who participated in the 2018
   DevSecOps community report - including where most mature DevOps practices
   are focusing their security efforts
   - A walkthrough of how security principles have been embedded in a CICD
   pipeline and what standards for implementation are beginning to follow suit.
