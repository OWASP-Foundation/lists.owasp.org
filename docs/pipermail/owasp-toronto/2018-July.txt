Hi everyone,

I am very excited to announce our next OWASP Toronto chapter event, which
will be a panel discussion on DevSecOps!

Please note that we have a new venue for this month. Shopify has gracefully
offered to host us at one of their Toronto offices (on Wellington).

As usual, space is limited, so please confirm your attendance on our Meetup
event pages (see links below).

Thanks,
Yuk Fai
