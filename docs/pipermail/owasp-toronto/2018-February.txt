*?How to Work a Room? Basic Networking Skills*
*Helping individuals achieve their personal goals by teaching and coaching
effective networking*

*Intro by OWASP Toronto:*
*As AppSec and information security professionals, we work in a field where
technical knowledge is key, while networking and communications skills,
which are just as important, are often overlooked. Marcel's insights on
effective networking will help you be more successful in your roles within
your organizations, or help you be better prepared to enter the security
workforce.*

*Speaker: Marcel Gagnier*

Marcel is a successful sales technology executive with over 20 years
experence in sales and account management. He owes his success primarily to
his networking skills.

Networking has allowed Marcel to develop relationships, and business, and
to support a wide range of interests as well as lifelong friendships.

As with many people networking did not come easily to Marcel. It is a
learned skill that he first developed while in the British Army starting
with human intelligence (HUMINT) on operations. These skills became further
refined when conducting threat assessments and social engineering. These
networking skills allowed Marcel to easily transition into the civilian
world in a variety of roles and in both small and large firms.

Marcel will share his insights in a workshop called ?How to Work a Room?
where basic networking skills will be covered.

You will learn the following:

   - The basics of networking - how it works
   - What events to attend and what events not to attend
   - How to research the event and attendees
   - Setting event goals
   - What to wear
   - What to carry
   - When to arrive
   - How to read the room
   - How to engage the best prospects
   - How to make an introduction
   - How to engage in conversation
   - How to exchange contacts and business cards
   - How to disengage
   - How to follow-up
