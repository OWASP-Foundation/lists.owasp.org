Title: Application Security ISO

 

ISO/IEC 27034 - Part 1 was published in November 2011 and the remaining
parts (Part 2-6) are expected to be published soon.  What does this mean to
your organization or your clients who wish to adopt or incorporate this ISO
standard for their software application?  This overview will walk through
the key sections of standard and highlight the process approach to
specifying, designing, developing, testing, implementing and maintaining
security functions and controls in application systems.  We will also
attempt to compare these key points against other industry guidelines to
determine the overall intentions and objectives of the standard.

INVITATION FOR DISTRIBUTION:

 

You are invited to join SANS, OWASP and members of your local security

interactive evening in conjunction with SANS Toronto 2012

Yuk Fai Chan and Maxim Veytsman will deliver their exciting presentation,
"Bust a Cap in a Mobile App."

As enterprises realize the efficiency in which employees operate by using
mobile apps and allowing employees to bring their own smartphones, a merging

discuss a number of mobile attack scenarios that may compromise enterprise
data and present to you how attackers may try to get at information within
smartphones, with live demos.
