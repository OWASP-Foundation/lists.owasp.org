*Web Application Penetration Testing - Methodology and Approach*

*Abstract:*
An introduction to web application penetration testing covering common
methodologies and approaches. Topics are: An overview of the business side
of how these engagements are commonly run, the methodology and mind-state
of penetration testing vs. vulnerability assessments, and a demo using
industry standard tools.  Recommended for people who are new to the
offensive side of security, those interested in learning more about the
topic, or who are interested in potentially switching from blue to red team.
