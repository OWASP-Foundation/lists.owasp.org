*Location*: Telus Tower, 25 York, 3rd Floor, Room 39

*Secure Code Review*

Presenter: Sherif Koussa

Secure Code Review is the best approach to uncover the largest number of
security flaws in addition to the most stealth and hard to uncover security
vulnerabilities. During this session, you will learn how to perform
security code review and uncover vulnerabilities such as OWASP Top 10:
Cross-site Scripting, SQL Injection, Access Control and much more in early
stages of development. You will use a real life application "SecureTickers"
pulled from SourceForge. You will get an introduction to Static Code
Analysis tools and how you can extend PMD (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/),
the open source static code analysis tool, to catch security flaws like
OWASP Top 10. Expect lots of code, tools, hacking and fun!

Looking forward to seeing you all.

Best regards,
Yuk Fai
