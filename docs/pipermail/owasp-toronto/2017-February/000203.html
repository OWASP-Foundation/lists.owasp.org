<PRE>Hello,

First off, thank you to everyone who attended our February chapter event
last Thursday. It was great to catch up with a few of you, and to see the
discussions that were generated around static code analysis.

I would like to use this opportunity to give thanks to:


   - Paul Kitor and *HP Enterprise*, for offering the guest presentation,
   and for being a Gold Local Chapter Supporter for Toronto
   &lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Toronto#Gold_Local_Chapter_Supporter">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Toronto#Gold_Local_Chapter_Supporter</A>&gt;!
   - *Security Compass*, for being a continuing local event supporter by
   hosting us once again at their office. Security Compass is also an OWASP
   Global Contributor Corporate Member
   &lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Acknowledgements">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Acknowledgements</A>&gt;.

Their contributions allow us to organize such events and to continue in our
mission to promote software security within the Toronto community.

We are also planning for our next event, which will be on *March 15*. An
announcement around the location, time, agenda and RSVP will be made
shortly. Save the date, and stay tuned!

Best,
Yuk Fai

*Yuk Fai Chan*
