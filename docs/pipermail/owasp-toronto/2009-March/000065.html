<PRE>Hi All,

As you know we have been quiet for a few months during the winter. We
have lined up 5 speakers for the next 5 months. The announcement of all
of them shall be made on Wednesday April 8th. I think they will all be
exciting talks.

The first of which is being done by HP's Rafal. I am sure many of you
have seen the new tool released by HP on flash hacking (SWFScan). Rafal
is going to talk more about Flash hacking and some of the hacks he has
seen during his assessments.
