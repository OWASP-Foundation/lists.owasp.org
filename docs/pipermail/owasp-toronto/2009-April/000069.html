<PRE>Hi All, 

Our 2nd meeting for this year is coming up in the next couple of weeks.
I thought I should let you know that there has been a small switch from
&quot;Doug Simpson&quot; from Cenzic (who is going to present in June on Beyond
&quot;Fuzzy&quot; Metrics:  Why You Need Quantifiable Metrics to Measure Risk) to
Jason Lam from Toronto. Jason is presenting a really exciting topic that
he has been researching on. This talk is new and I haven't seen the
content of this really discussed in a whole lot of places. I am sure you
will be excited to see him present.

Please note the time of the talk is slightly later than usual (since
Jason is going to be coming in after teaching a SANS class near the
airport)
Hope you can attend this session, please RSVP to the address below
Location: 4-179B, 121 King Street West, Toronto
&lt;<A HREF="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=121+King+Street+West,+">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=121+King+Street+West,+</A>

908,-79.383473&amp;spn=0.01357,0.037594&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=addr&gt;  (same as last
time) 
Date/Time: May 13th, 2009, 6:45-8:00 PM EST  
Title: Cross Site AJAX Hacking 
Description: The era of AJAX technologies has only been possible after
XMLHttpRequest released its full potential. But XMLHttpRequest has had a
number of security concerns, in particular due to its ability to create
flexible requests against web sites without the users knowledge. Up to
now, the same origin policy limited the impact of this issue. 
The Web 2.0 vision calls for the flexible use and rendering of
information in mash-ups created by mixing content from various sources
on the fly. This idea is not easily implemented in Javascript due to
same origin restrictions. In order to allow for these features, XHR
Level 2 and XDR have been developed to remove the same origin policy and
allow the ability to request information from various sites. Current
browsers make these functions available to developers and you will soon
find sites that require them. The presentation will provide information
on the mechanics of these cross site AJAX calls and their security
impact. 
As an add-on to the discussion - It has been a year since Johannes
Ullrich have given a talk on Dshield Web App honeypot project. I will
provide a small update on the progress of this project. It's a low key
project but you may be amazed at what we are doing. 
Presenter: Jason Lam 
BIO: Jason is a senior security analyst at a major financial institute
in Canada. He is also an author and instructor for SANS Institute where
he writes courses on pentesting and defending web applications. In his
ever diminishing free time, he helps with the SANS Internet Storm Center
as an incident handler. He took on the role to be a leader for the
Dshield honeypot project where logs from web honeypot all over the world
are collected and analyzed.

Modeling at the RSA conference this April!
