Working Title: A Laugh RIAt - Rich Internet Application Security
Session Abstract:  Rich Internet Applications [RIA] are popping up
everywhere! Enterprises and boutique online shops alike are rushing to
adopt these technologies without really thinking of the implications of
moving pseudo-server functionality to the user's desktop and browser.
Hacking these applications has now moved from the challenge of
compromising the server, to the significantly smaller challenge of
compromising the client. You'll be able to witness (and try!) first-hand
how to manipulate an AJAX-rich web application you or your colleagues
probably use many times; as well as see and understand how breaking down
a Flash binary object (SWF file) isn't difficult. These types of
applications are now treasure-troves of goodies... don't miss out on the
simple ways you can security test these technologies on your desktop
today!
Presenters:  Rafal M. Los, Sr. Security Solutions Specialist, HP
