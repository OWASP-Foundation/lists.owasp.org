Title: Security Community Engagement

 

Mozilla is one of the most successful open source projects in existence, and
has helped transform the way users and developers interact with the
Internet.  In the last few years there has been many new ways to use the
Internet, including new competitors in the Browser market, mobile and
desktop Apps, and a proliferation of platforms, APIs, and new technologies.
Mozilla has a strong base of contributors to many areas, including Firefox,
Thunderbird, our huge Add-On collection, and our support sites, but not many
people know that Mozilla is also open to community engagement with our
Security program as well!  In this discussion I will explain how our
Security program functions, and how and where we are looking for improved
engagement and contribution from the community, and some of the benefits to
contributing!

 

Speaker Bio:

 

Yvan Boily is an Application Security Manager with Mozilla Corporation,
where he manages one of two application security teams focused on the
security of Mozilla web properties and end-user applications.

 

 

We look forward to seeing you there!
