OWASP Ottawa chapter leader, will be visiting us and giving a talk on
secure code review. Here are some preliminary details and a preview of his
presentation:

*Date: May 8th
Location: TBD*

*Secure Code Review* is the best approach to uncover the largest number
ofsecurity flaws in addition to the most stealth and hard to uncover
security vulnerabilities. During this session, you will learn how to
perform security code review and uncover vulnerabilities such as OWASP Top
10: Cross-site Scripting, SQL Injection, Access Control and much more in
early stages of development. You will use a real life application
"SecureTickers" pulled from SourceForge. You will get an introduction to
Static Code Analysis tools and how you can extend PMD (
http://pmd.sourceforge.net/), the open source static code analysis tool, to
catch security flaws like OWASP Top 10. Expect lots of code, tools, hacking
and fun! *

Stay tuned for more details!
