<PRE>Hi everyone,

I am happy to announce our next chapter event, scheduled for March 15.

This month, Amazon has graciously offered to host us in their Toronto
office!

*IMPORTANT* - We are making special changes to our RSVP process to adapt to
this new venue:

   - *ONLY attendees who confirmed through our chapter's Meetup.com event
   page &lt;<A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/238149169/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/238149169/</A>&gt; will be
   allowed entry*. So please confirm your presence if you are planning to
   come. This is required so that visitor badges can be created for those on
   the list and provided by the reception at the Amazon office.
   - *The RSVP period will run from March 3 to March 12*. This is to allow
   enough time for visitor badges to be created, and to plan for the event's
   logistics.
   - *If you need to make change to your attendance status, please do so by
   March 12*. We understand that plans change, but given a limited space,
   please be mindful of others in the community who may benefit from the event.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach reach out to us.

Below are the details for this month's event!

-----
*Date/Time:* February 16, 2017, 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM.
*Location:* 120 Bremner Blvd, 26th Floor, Toronto, ON
*Event page*: <A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/238149169/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/238149169/</A>

*Agenda:*

*1 - Overview and Intro to OWASP Projects - Yuk Fai Chan*

A quick overview of the OWASP will be presented for those who are
unfamiliar with the global organization, followed by a introduction of
OWASP Projects - the process, the people, and some examples - from
Flagship, Lab to Incubator.

*Yuk Fai Chan is with the OWASP Toronto chapter. He also works as a
security consultant.*

*2 - Vulnerabilities from upstream on down - Max Veytsman*

Security vulnerabilities in open source software are patched by maintainers
every day, but most of the software your servers have installed is coming
from a package manager.

When a new vulnerability in openssl is disclosed, how does it make it to
the corresponding Ubuntu package? How long does it take?

Every distribution has a security team. I'm going to describe the work that
they do, talk about how vulnerabilities are prioritized and discuss some
statistics about their operations.

*Max Veytsman is a recovering pentester. Nowadays, he's helping the world
patch its software at Appcanary.*
