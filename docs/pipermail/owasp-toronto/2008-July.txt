Title: Business Logic Flaws

Session Abstract: How they put your Websites at Risk Session handling,
credit card transactions, and password recovery are just a few examples
of Web-enabled business logic processes that malicious hackers have
abused to compromise major websites. These types of vulnerabilities are
routinely overlooked during QA because the process is intended to test
what a piece of code is supposed to do and not what it can be made to
do. The other problem(s) with business logic flaws is scanners can't
identify them, IDS can't detect them, and Web application firewalls
can't defend them. Plus, the more sophisticated and Web 2.0 feature-rich
a website, the more prone it is to have flaws in business logic.The
presentation will provide real-world examples of how pernicious and
dangerous business logic flaws are to the security of a website. We'll
also show how best to spot them and provide organizations with a simple
and rational game plan to prevent them.

Presenters:  Trey Ford, Director, Solutions Architecture, WhiteHat
Security, Inc.
