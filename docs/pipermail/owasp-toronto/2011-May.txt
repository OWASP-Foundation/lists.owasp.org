Hello everyone,

We have so far received a great level of interest for next week's speaking event, and a lot of you have RSVP'ed already!

Speaker: Max Veytsman
Title: Mobile Security for the Forgetful

You've accidentally misplaced your company or personal mobile phone in a public location. In this scenario, what threats do you and/or your organization face?

This talk will be about the worst case scenario in mobile security: when the attacker has physical access to the phone. According to DataLossDB, about 1/5 of all data breaches they have recorded are due to lost or stolen laptops. Phones are much easier to lose (or steal) then laptops, and these days the data on our phones can be as confidential as the data on our laptops.

This talk will go over physical access attacks from an attacker's perspective, discuss ways of coding mobile applications to defend against these kinds of attacks, and discuss some ways of securing our phones as users. Technical details in this talk will focus on the Android platform.

Length: 60 minutes
