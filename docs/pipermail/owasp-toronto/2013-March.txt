Message-ID: <CAO9ySDHrBJvRW61SD7A5Z73hhBtc-GYY_wMWQhpuNR_EQ_9f7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am finally happy to announce our next chapter meeting!

Please note the new location details. *Due to fire and building
regulations, there is a maximum occupancy allowed in the venue, so if you
would like to attend it is very important that you RSVP at
yuk.fai.chan at owasp.org to confirm your presence!*

-----

*Date/Time*: March 20th, 2013, 6:30 - 8:30 PM EST
*Location*: PwC Tower, 18 York Street, Suite 2600, Toronto ON M5J 0B2

*Session 1: Summary of HP 2012 Cyber Risk Report*
Presenter: Subu Ramanathan, Security Compass

Subu will be presenting a summary of the HP 2012 Cyber Risk Report, which
amongst other topics covers the vulnerability landscape of web and mobile
applications.

*Session 2: NFC Village*
Presenter: Geoff Vaughan, Security Compass

NFC technologies are used in many widespread commercial applications. In
some cases, attackers are taking advantage of the few security features
have been implemented. Security Compass is currently developing an NFC
village for use at future conferences. Come try out our mock NFC village to
learn about NFC technologies and see for yourself what personal data is
being stored on the cards. There will be many opportunities to experiment
with NFC and tons of tags available to scan and manipulate. Bring your NFC
enabled phone ( Android / Blackberry) as you will have an opportunity to
scan tags for prizes.

*Before you come:*
There are many NFC apps available for Android devices (and a few for
Blackberry). We have reviewed a number of them, and for the purpose of this
lab, we will be demoing TagWritter and SquareLess for Android. In order for
you to get the most out of the NFC village, you may consider installing
these apps in advance (or any other comparable one). You will also need to
make sure that you have NFC enabled on your device.


Looking forward to seeing you all.

Best regards,
Yuk Fai

Message-ID: <CAGmFpydXwN79mPfAJ6qeabycRuFeGrnKZ6DkPU8GQuXA8xK2Aw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

We are happy to announce that we have partnered with the Ottawa IT Code
Camp, Ottawa's largest developers gathering, and will be hosting an
application security track at this year's Ottawa IT Code Camp 2013! For
more details on the event please visit the official site:
http://www.ottawacodecamp.ca/pages2013/default.aspx.

We are so excited because this is developers conference originally, so we
hope that this is another step towards reaching out to them.

Right now we are looking for speakers who are interested in speaking about
the following topics:

- Secure development: frameworks, best practices, secure coding, methods,
processes, SDLC- Vulnerability analysis: code review, pentesting, static
analysis- Mobile security- HTML5 security- OWASP tools or projects in
practice- New technologies, paradigms, tools

If you are interested in submitting a talk, please visit (
http://www.ottawacodecamp.ca/Pages2013/speaker.aspx

You can find more information here:

Hi everyone,

This is a reminder that we are having our next chapter event on March 20th.

Please note that the speakers have had to modify their agenda - there will
still be a presentation on NFC, but the hands-on component will be for
another time.

Again, if you would like to attend it is very important that you *RSVP at
yuk.fai.chan at owasp.org to confirm your presence*! There is a maximum
occupancy allowed in the venue.

*Session 2: NFC Threat Landscape*
Presenter: Geoff Vaughan, Security Compass

Near Field Communication is on pace to be one of the most explosive
technologies in North America for 2013. Over 2012 we?ve seen a number of
industry steps to making this a reality. Nearly all phone makers are
putting NFC into all new phones they develop. Over the last year we have
also seen widespread adoption by a large number of financial institutions
to put NFC into all their new credit cards and banking cards as well as
many mobile payment systems now accepting the technology. At this point we
need to take a step back and evaluate the implications of having NFC always
enabled on a consumer phone and the implications of storing mobile payment
data on an individuals phone. NFC technologies are intimately embedded into
all core features of a smart phone and this presents a very large attack
and vulnerability surface for an attacker to potentially exploit.


Looking forward to seeing you all.
