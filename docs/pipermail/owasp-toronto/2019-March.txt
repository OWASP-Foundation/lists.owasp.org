Good afternoon everyone,

We've uploaded the powerpoint slides from the *In Root we Trust*
presentation to OWASP.org. Since a bunch of people have been asking for it,
the slides have been updated with Pavan and Lisa's contact details. So if
you have any additional questions/comments they'd be happy to help!

Please check that out here:

All the best,

I don't know of any downtime or reason for the links to the group not to
work nor has anyone else reported that issue yet.  It is possible your
company firewall may block that URL.

I am also assuming you're using the links in the second email "with
corrected links" as the automation to send these notifications had a bug
that effected the first email sent - basically @owasp.org was included
incorrectly in the links.

Cheers!

Subject: [OWASP-Toronto] Sharing code online - Security information
Message-ID: <CACBE8Jot3u6dSyxi4XRjfg2fBSccOBode+Uf9NbSg8dT21vW8A@mail.gmail.com>

Good afternoon,



I am trying to compile a list of best practices in my business on how to
share code responsibly and securely.



In basic terms, I?m trying to come out with a short of checklist for our
coders like a best practices or do?s and don?ts on how to make sure your
code is clean to post online to open source repositories like GitHub and
others.



Because right now, it?s like the wild, wild, west. Upper management is
telling coders to do everything in the cloud and share your code, but they
do so carelessly.



In big, am trying to see if you offer such a list or ideas what to do, like
an OWASP top 10.



Stuff I know I need my coders to look for is;



-          Ensuring that no internal server names or IP addresses are
posted in the code

-          To use caution when posting DB?s and ensuring that they only
contain non-sensitive / test data and not actual client data.

-          Usernames, passwords, private keys to be removed and /or
replaced as appropriate

-          Scan code with security tool



If you do have guidelines or checklist for this type of security /
sanitation, I would appreciate being guided towards it.



Any help on this subject is greatly appreciated.



Best Regards,


Brian Maher
