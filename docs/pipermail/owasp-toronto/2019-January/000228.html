*Date/Time*: January 23, 2019, 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM EST
*Location*: Room 128, St. James Campus - Building A, George Brown College,
200 King Street East, Toronto, ON, M5A 3W8
*Event page:* <A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/258008651/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/258008651/</A>

*Back to the Future of Application Security: Developing Secure Smart
Contracts*

*Abstract:*

Race-conditions, re-entrancy, bad randomness, unchecked calls and integer
overflows! No, we&#8217;re not coding a C++98 application and worried about the
Y2K bug; it&#8217;s 2019 and welcome to the world of smart contracts! Grab some
avocado toast and GAS-up for a trip onto the blockchain, because where
we're going, we don't need roads.

We&#8217;ll start with an introduction to smart contracts and their place in the
distributed ledger technology ecosystem. We&#8217;ll delve into key
vulnerabilities from the SWC (Smart Contract Weakness) registry and link
them to real world impacts. We&#8217;ll identify smart contract flaws in Solidity
and ultimately how to mitigate them.

Ending with some key principals in building secure smart contracts and
suggested tooling to augment secure smart contract development flow. All
with a dash of lamenting how by forgetting the past we are doomed to repeat
it.  And of course, no talk would be complete without a smart contract CTF
challenge, or two, for the taking.

*Speaker Bio:*

Jamie Baxter, M. Eng., OSCP, OSCE, GPEN, CISSP
Principal Consultant &amp; Founder - SRNSEC Inc.

Jamie is an independent security consultant specializing in security
assessments, ranging from web application and infrastructure penetration
tests to red teaming exercises.

Prior to independent consulting, Jamie was the Director of Cyber Security
Assessments at RBC, a Senior Penetration Tester for the Department of
National Defense, and a developer for over 10 years.

When not on an engagement, he can be found competing in and building CTFs
or exploring the world of distributed ledger technology security.
