*How to stop worrying about Application Container Security*

Containers make it easier to deploy the applications that drive business
value, but also profoundly challenge existing security models. Learn from
our journey as a security team that went from not knowing what containers
were to championing their adoption in our production sensitive information
workloads over traditional DevOps application deployments.


   - About Us
   - Our Application &amp; Security Challenges
   - Our Container Journey
   - Building an Container Ecosystem
   - Learning Secure Application Containers
   - Benefits for DevOps and Security
   - Our Container Security Maturity Model
   - What&#8217;s Next



*Presenter: Brian Andrzejewski (@DevSecOpsGeer)*

represented USCIS as a hands-on SME in several working groups within DHS
and Federal government on DevSecOps, Application Security, Cloud Migration
&amp; Security, Container Security, and CyberDefense operations best practices.

Prior to USCIS, Brian brings his prior 17+ years of professional
experiences in information security, risk management, IT Operations, system
development &amp; administration, &amp; DFIR from the Department of Defense,
