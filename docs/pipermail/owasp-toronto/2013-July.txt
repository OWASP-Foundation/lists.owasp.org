*OWASP: Beyond the Top 10*

Join us as we take a guided tour through some of OWASPs lesser-known
projects -- present and future. For students and new entrants to the
application security profession, get practical advice on options for
building and honing your skills. Developers and administrators alike might
benefit from an overview of OWASPs projects for secure SDLC, source code
review, and vulnerability assessment and mitigation. The seasoned
professionals can engage in a lively discussion and critique of OWASP
projects in the pipeline, and how the community as a whole is tackling
security for the web, mobile, and beyond. An OWASP session featuring a
buffet of OWASP offerings and a potluck of alternatives and enhancements.

Your host for this session is Andre Rochefort, an infosec veteran and
lifelong computer geek. As a developer, a security auditor, and a loudmouth
conference heckler, Andre offers a wealth of experience and anecdotes, with
a generous helping of opinion. His day-to-day activities at TELUS include
source code analysis, vulnerability assessments and penetration tests, with
a  heavy focus on web and mobile application security.

Hey Toronto-OWASP,

A big Thank You again to everyone who attended Wednesday night's presentation. I hope you all walked away with at least one or two new insights on OWASP Projects.

A couple of follow-ups:

1) If there's enough interest in giving the InfoSec-themed card or board games a few test plays (e.g. MS Elevation of Privilege [http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl/adopt/eop.aspx], d0xed [http://d0x3d.com/], Control-Alt-Hack [http://www.controlalthack.com/]), I'll volunteer to coordinate an afternoon/evening event. We could try and invade Snakes & Lattes (http://www.snakesandlattes.com/) though I hear space is frequently limited; or I could seek permission to host the event at TELUS House.

2) The Mozilla Blog just posted an entry titled "How to speed up OWASP ZAP scans" (https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2013/07/10/how-to-speed-up-owasp-zap-scans/), which contains not only great advice on tuning application security scans -- the tips apply to ZAP and most other scanners -- but also provides a good overview of how web application security scanners operate.

Have a great weekend, and stay safe.

Andre
