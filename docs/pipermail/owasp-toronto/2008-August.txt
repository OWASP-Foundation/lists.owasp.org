Message-ID: <BF1745279F55F64D9F84197E33182395102667@mail-43ps.atlarge.net>

Hi All,

 

Look forward to seeing you at the meeting.

 

Regards,

 

Nish.

 

Location: 4-179B, 121 King Street West, Toronto (same as last time)

 

Date/Time: August 14th 2008, 6:00-7:30 PM EST

 

Title: An Introduction To Reverse Engineering Malware

 

Session Abstract: This talk will cover the basics of setting up an
environment to reverse engineer malware, and an introduction to some
tools and techniques that can be used to determine what exactly that bit
of unknown, potentially hostile code does. While this is an introductory
talk, we'll definitely cover more than "run strings on the binary and
see what you get!"

 

Presenters: Seth Hardy, MessageLabs Inc.

 

BIO: Seth Hardy recently moved to Toronto to do reverse engineering work
for MessageLabs, as part of their antivirus research and response group.
Before that, he worked mostly in the areas of vulnerability research and
cryptography. In his spare time, Seth likes to work on
community-building projects both online and off. He currently holds the
GIAC GREM certification, and should have the CISSP before this
presentation; if not, feel free to mock him mercilessly for it.
