*OWASP ASVS*

Since the last release of the OWASP Application Security Verification
Standard (ASVS) Project in 2009, significant improvements have been made,
including but not limited to:

1. Content updates to add new relevant content and clarify existing content
2. Document segregation
3. Case studies
4. Mapping to other relevant standards

In this presentation, we will walk through the major changes that we
believe will increase adoption of the standard in industry.
