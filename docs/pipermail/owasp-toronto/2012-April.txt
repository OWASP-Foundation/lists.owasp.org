Hi Yvan,

 

We are in the process of organizing the OWASP Toronto chapter meetings for
May and June, but I will definitely let you know when I have something
concrete for July. A drink to chat about AppSec sounds definitely like a
great idea!

 

Regards,

Title: Application Security ISO

 

ISO/IEC 27034 - Part 1 was published in November 2011 and the remaining
parts (Part 2-6) are expected to be published soon.  What does this mean to
your organization or your clients who wish to adopt or incorporate this ISO
standard for their software application?  This overview will walk through
the key sections of standard and highlight the process approach to
specifying, designing, developing, testing, implementing and maintaining
security functions and controls in application systems.  We will also
attempt to compare these key points against other industry guidelines to
determine the overall intentions and objectives of the standard.
