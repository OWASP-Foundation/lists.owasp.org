 ly\nTitle: Security Community Engagement\n\nMozilla is one of the most succ
 essful open source projects in existence\, and has helped transform the way
  users and developers interact with the Internet.  In the last few years th
 ere has been many new ways to use the Internet\, including new competitors 
 in the Browser market\, mobile and desktop Apps\, and a proliferation of pl
 atforms\, APIs\, and new technologies.  Mozilla has a strong base of contri
 butors to many areas\, including Firefox\, Thunderbird\, our huge Add-On co
 llection\, and our support sites\, but not many people know that Mozilla is
  also open to community engagement with our Security program as well!  In t
 his discussion I will explain how our Security program functions\, and how 
 and where we are looking for improved engagement and contribution from the 
 community\, and some of the benefits to contributing!\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nYv
