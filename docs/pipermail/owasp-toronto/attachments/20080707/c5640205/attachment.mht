Title: Business Logic Flaws
Session Abstract: How they put your Websites at Risk Session handling, =
credit card transactions, and password recovery are just a few examples =
of Web-enabled business logic processes that malicious hackers have =
abused to compromise major websites. These types of vulnerabilities are =
routinely overlooked during QA because the process is intended to test =
what a piece of code is supposed to do and not what it can be made to =
do. The other problem(s) with business logic flaws is scanners can't =
identify them, IDS can't detect them, and Web application firewalls =
can't defend them. Plus, the more sophisticated and Web 2.0 feature-rich =
a website, the more prone it is to have flaws in business logic.The =
presentation will provide real-world examples of how pernicious and =
dangerous business logic flaws are to the security of a website. We'll =
also show how best to spot them and provide organizations with a simple =
and rational game plan to prevent them.
Presenters:  Trey Ford, Director, Solutions Architecture, WhiteHat =
Security, Inc.
BIO: Trey Ford is the Director of Solutions Architecture at WhiteHat =
Security, providing strategic guidance to WhiteHat customers and =
prospects on their website security programs.  Mr. Ford also spearheads =
WhiteHat's participation in the PCI Standards Council and assists =
customers in selecting WhiteHat services for compliance with the PCI =
Data Security Standard.  In addition, Mr. Ford is a frequent speaker at =
industry events.  Prior to WhiteHat, he was the Compliance Practice Lead =
at FishNet Security, an information security services provider based in =
Kansas City.  Mr. Ford also founded and operated, Eclectix, a technology =
consultancy.  He is a certified information system security professional =
(CISSP), a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer, a Cisco Certified =
Networking Associate (CCNA), and a Payment Card Industry Qualified Data =
