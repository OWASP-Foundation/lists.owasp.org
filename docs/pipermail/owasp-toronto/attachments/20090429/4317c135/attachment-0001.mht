Title: Cross Site AJAX Hacking=20
Description: The era of AJAX technologies has only been possible after =
XMLHttpRequest released its full potential. But XMLHttpRequest has had a =
number of security concerns, in particular due to its ability to create =
flexible requests against web sites without the users knowledge. Up to =
now, the same origin policy limited the impact of this issue.=20
The Web 2.0 vision calls for the flexible use and rendering of =
information in mash-ups created by mixing content from various sources =
on the fly. This idea is not easily implemented in Javascript due to =
same origin restrictions. In order to allow for these features, XHR =
Level 2 and XDR have been developed to remove the same origin policy and =
allow the ability to request information from various sites. Current =
browsers make these functions available to developers and you will soon =
find sites that require them. The presentation will provide information =
on the mechanics of these cross site AJAX calls and their security =
impact.=20
As an add-on to the discussion - It has been a year since Johannes =
Ullrich have given a talk on Dshield Web App honeypot project. I will =
provide a small update on the progress of this project. It's a low key =
project but you may be amazed at what we are doing.=20
Presenter: Jason Lam=20
BIO: Jason is a senior security analyst at a major financial institute =
in Canada. He is also an author and instructor for SANS Institute where =
he writes courses on pentesting and defending web applications. In his =
ever diminishing free time, he helps with the SANS Internet Storm Center =
as an incident handler. He took on the role to be a leader for the =
Dshield honeypot project where logs from web honeypot all over the world =
are collected and analyzed.=20
