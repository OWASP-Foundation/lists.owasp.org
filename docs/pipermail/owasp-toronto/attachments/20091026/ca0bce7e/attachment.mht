Title: Corporate Identity Considerations for Cloud and ASP Applications
Speaker: Joe Bate

Description and Bio:

Topic: Software Assurance Maturity Model (OpenSAMM)
The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) into a software development or=
ganization. Covering more than typical SDLC-based models for security, SAMM=
 enables organizations to self-assess their security assurance program and =
then use recommended roadmaps to improve in a way that's aligned to the spe=
cific risks facing the organization. Beyond that, SAMM enables creation of =
scorecards for an organization's effectiveness at secure software developme=
nt throughout the typical governance, development, and deployment business =
functions. Scorecards also enable management within an organization to demo=
nstrate quantitative improvements through iterations of building a security=
 assurance program. This workshop will introduce the SAMM framework and wal=
k through useful activities such as assessing an assurance program, mapping=
 an existing organization to a recommended roadmap, and iteratively buildin=
g an assurance program. Time allowing, additional case studies will also be=
 discussed. OpenSAMM is an open a free project and has recently been donate=
d to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Foundation. For more=
 information on OpenSAMM, visit http://www.opensamm.org/
