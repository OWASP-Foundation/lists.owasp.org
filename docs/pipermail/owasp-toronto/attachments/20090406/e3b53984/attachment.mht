Working Title: A Laugh RIAt - Rich Internet Application Security
Session Abstract:  Rich Internet Applications [RIA] are popping up =
everywhere! Enterprises and boutique online shops alike are rushing to =
adopt these technologies without really thinking of the implications of =
moving pseudo-server functionality to the user's desktop and browser. =
Hacking these applications has now moved from the challenge of =
compromising the server, to the significantly smaller challenge of =
compromising the client. You'll be able to witness (and try!) first-hand =
how to manipulate an AJAX-rich web application you or your colleagues =
probably use many times; as well as see and understand how breaking down =
a Flash binary object (SWF file) isn't difficult. These types of =
applications are now treasure-troves of goodies... don't miss out on the =
simple ways you can security test these technologies on your desktop =
today!
