Title: An Introduction To Reverse Engineering Malware

Session Abstract: This talk will cover the basics of setting up an =
environment to reverse engineer malware, and an introduction to some =
tools and techniques that can be used to determine what exactly that bit =
of unknown, potentially hostile code does. While this is an introductory =
talk, we'll definitely cover more than &quot;run strings on the binary and =
see what you get!&quot;

Presenters: Seth Hardy, MessageLabs Inc.

BIO: Seth Hardy recently moved to Toronto to do reverse engineering work =
for MessageLabs, as part of their antivirus research and response group. =
Before that, he worked mostly in the areas of vulnerability research and =
cryptography. In his spare time, Seth likes to work on =
community-building projects both online and off. He currently holds the =
GIAC GREM certification, and should have the CISSP before this =
presentation; if not, feel free to mock him mercilessly for it.
