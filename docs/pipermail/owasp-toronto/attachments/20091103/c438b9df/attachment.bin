 0 PM EST  (THURSDAY)\nTitle: Software Assurance Maturity Model\nSpeaker: P
 ravir Chandra\n\nDescription and Bio:\n\nTopic: Software Assurance Maturit
 y Model (OpenSAMM)\nThe Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) into a so
 ftware development organization. Covering more than typical SDLC-based mod
 els for security\, SAMM enables organizations to self-assess their securit
 y assurance program and then use recommended roadmaps to improve in a way 
 that's aligned to the specific risks facing the organization. Beyond that\
 , SAMM enables creation of scorecards for an organization's effectiveness 
 at secure software development throughout the typical governance\, develop
 ment\, and deployment business functions. Scorecards also enable managemen
 t within an organization to demonstrate quantitative improvements through 
 iterations of building a security assurance program. This workshop will in
 troduce the SAMM framework and walk through useful activities such as asse
 ssing an assurance program\, mapping an existing organization to a recomme
 nded roadmap\, and iteratively building an assurance program. Time allowin
 g\, additional case studies will also be discussed. OpenSAMM is an open a 
 free project and has recently been donated to the Open Web Application Sec
 urity Project (OWASP) Foundation. For more information on OpenSAMM\, visit
  http://www.opensamm.org/\n\nBio:\nPravir Chandra is Director of Strategic
  Services at Fortify Software and works with clients on software security 
 assurance programs. Pravir is recognized for his expertise in software sec
 urity\, code analysis\, and his ability to strategically apply technical k
 nowledge. Prior to Fortify\, he was a Principal Consultant affiliated with
  Cigital and led large software security programs at Fortune 500 companies
 . Pravir Co-Founded Secure Software\, Inc. and was Chief Security Architec
 t prior to its acquisition by Fortify. He recently created and led the Ope
 n Software Assurance Maturity Model (OpenSAMM) project with the OWASP Foun
 dation\, leads the OWASP CLASP project\, and also serves as member of the 
 OWASP Global Projects Committee. Pravir is author of the book Network Secu
 rity with OpenSSL.\n\n\nRSVP: Please RSVP to nish[at]securitycompass.com\n
