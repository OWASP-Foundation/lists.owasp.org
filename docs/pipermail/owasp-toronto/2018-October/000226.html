*Date/Time*: November 14, 2018, 6:00 PM to 8 PM DST
*Location*: 390 Queens Quay West, Suite 209, Toronto ON, M5V 3A6

*Sonatype DevSecOps Community Survey - Working Session*

Sonatype will be facilitating small group working sessions using data from
their 2018 DevSecOps Community Survey. See description below!

*DevOps is Security&#8217;s New Front Line*

As we embrace movements like CI, CD and Devops to cut down on release
cycles - and innovate faster, we as developers must also embrace the
reality that the risk landscape is too complex to leave &#8220;security&#8221; to just
those with security in their title. Traditional methods do not cut it
anymore &#8211; it&#8217;s time for DevSecOps.

In a recent 2018 DevSecOps Community report, where 2,076 IT professionals
were surveyed, 48% of respondents admitted that developers know application
security is important, but they don&#8217;t have the time to spend on it. Done
properly, DevSecOps practices shouldn&#8217;t interrupt the DevOps pipeline - but
instead aid it - preventing costly rebuilds and build breaks, down the road.

Attendees of this session will walk away with:

   - Real-world examples of how large and small companies are implementing
   DevSecOps practices in their own delivery pipelines, and increasing
   developer awareness to risks
   - Key insights from 2,076 of their peers who participated in the 2018
   DevSecOps community report - including where most mature DevOps practices
   are focusing their security efforts
   - A walkthrough of how security principles have been embedded in a CICD
   pipeline and what standards for implementation are beginning to follow suit.
