Subject: [Owasp-toronto] OWASP Toronto August 2013 Event - OWASP Canada Call
Message-ID: <CAO9ySDH+pg7jUG5jraC3CfKREEacysm1V_sFeEts-NBd3FrcEA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone!

I am happy to announce our next chapter event, which will in fact be a
joint event with OWASP chapters across Canada, with a virtual presentation
from Raymond Forbes, Web Security Engineer at Mozilla Corporation!

This will hopefully be the first in a series of events designed to connect
the OWASP community across the country. The goal is to have a virtual call
with a speaker from one location delivering a streaming talk, and engaging
the entire community.

*Please RSVP to patrick.szeto at owasp.org or yuk.fai.chan at owasp.org to
confirm your presence. This is important as it helps us plan the logistics
for the event.

Hey OWASP-Toronto followers,



Another follow-up on earlier discussions:



Re. visualizations, there was a talk at Def Con 21 demonstrating new tools for website and vulnerability mapping I found interesting. If you haven't seen it yet, there's a video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wF4xn0JrhU&feature=youtu.be



Meanwhile, on the security requirements front, the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) has been updated with a beta of 2.0, available at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS#tab=Downloads



Still looking for more card game participants. If we have to sandwich d0xed between rounds of Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne, so be it.



Andre
