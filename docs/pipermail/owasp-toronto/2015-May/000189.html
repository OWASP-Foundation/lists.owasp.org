<PRE>Hello everyone,

Thank you all for your overwhelming interest our next OWASP chapter
meeting! The event is now officially SOLD OUT.

For those of you who have registered through Eventbrite but may no longer
attend, please do let us know so that we may potentially accommodate people
on the waiting list.

For those of you who may not be able to attend, we will make our best
efforts possible to record the session and to make it available online
afterwards.

*Date/Time: May 20, 2015, 6:00 - 8:00 PM EDTLocation: Suite 500, 257
Adelaide St. W., Toronto, ON*




*Panel Discussion: State of Application Security in 2015We invite you to
join us at our next OWASP Toronto chapter meeting, where a panel of
industry professionals will discuss the state of application security in
2015. Panelists will share their point of view on a number of topics,
followed by an open discussion with the audience. Come prepared to learn,
discuss, share, and ask questions!*

   1. *Appsec Wishlist*: &quot;If I could have one thing improved in application
   security in 2015, it would be ...&quot;
   2. *Appsec Defenders*: Offensive Security is obviously thriving, but how
   are the Defenders doing? Has there been improvement? There are plenty of
   blackhat/red team rock stars, but are we giving enough credit to the blue
   teams?
   3. *Appsec Tools*: Which application security tools are doing the job
   right? Which ones can be further improved?
   4. *Evolution of Application Security Assessments*: How will the
   industry effect a sea change in attitude towards assessing software for
   security issues? The tunnel-vision model (i.e., black-box only, source code
   review only, configuration review only) is deficient, and the best approach
   is to overlap as many techniques as possible. Time-boxed approaches
   compound the problem, and with the increasing proliferation and complexity
   of applications in any given organization, scaling assessment services to
   all targets is bottlenecked.
   5. *Appsec Talent*: There are too few skilled/trained information
   security professionals, and too much work to do. Scaling up to meet the
   demand can only partially be managed through automation. Where will the
   next wave of reliable security professionals come from? Is training for
   information security skills too expensive in the age Code School? Is North
   Armerica in need of a CREST-like certification to establish a baseline
   level of coverage by a practitioner?

*Panelists*
To be announced at the event!

I am very excited about this panel discussion tomorrow - looking forward to
seeing you all!

Best,
Yuk Fai
