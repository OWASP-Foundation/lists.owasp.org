<PRE>Hello everyone,


SecTor &lt;<A HREF="http://www.sector.ca/">http://www.sector.ca/</A>&gt; is searching for a few keynotes as well as
speakers for their upcoming event Oct. 19-Oct. 21, 2015 in Toronto,
Ontario, Canada and has asked for our help.  Last year the event drew just
over 2,000+ attendees and they expect to exceed that number this year.

Below is the information they have sent regarding both keynote and speaker
talks.  To be included in the first round speaker selection, your proposal
submission must be submitted
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.sector.ca/Program/Speakers/Call-for-Speakers">http://www.sector.ca/Program/Speakers/Call-for-Speakers</A>&gt; *prior to April
26, 2015*.

==============================================================

*If you are submitting a speaker/paper please note:*

*1.       **The deadline for first round speaker selection is April
26th.  *Second
round speaker selection deadline is Aug 16th.

2.       We have 3 technical, 1 management and 1 fundamentals tracks. * If
selected for our technical or management tracks, we will cover travel
(flight and hotel) costs for your speaker. *

3.       *Absolutely no marketing or product pitches please*.

4.       I always tell prospective speakers to submit more than one paper
as it&#8217;s the content that is selected and not the company submitting it.  It
is possible to have more than one speaking opportunity at SecTor

5.       Selection is made by majority vote by our advisory committee.  If
your topic is a &#8220;maybe&#8221; it will be held for the second round (due Aug 16th)
for re-review.

6.       We aim to place 50% of the sessions after first round and then the
remaining 50% at second round.  I always recommend submitting speakers to
both deadlines.

7.       For more information on past speaking presentations please visit
us at:  <A HREF="http://www.sector.ca/Media/Presentations">http://www.sector.ca/Media/Presentations</A>



*Submission requirements:*

email:

1.       Presenter and contact info (country of origin and residence,
e-mail, postal address, phone, fax).

2.       Employer and/or affiliations.

3.       Brief biography.

4.       Topic synopsis, Proposed paper title, and a one paragraph
description.

5.       Reason why this material is innovative or significant and/or how
you think attendees will be able to apply the knowledge.

6.       Optional: List of publications, papers or other speaking
engagements.  Give us an idea of your qualifications.

7.       Optional: Samples of prepared material or outlines ready.

8.       Optional: Let us know if you plan a whitepaper or tool release
with the talk.

9.       Please list any other publications or conferences where this
material has been or will be published/submitted.

&#167;  SECurity FUNdamentals talk (60min) - travel not covered
