<PRE>Hi everyone,

Please note that SecTor's first round selection has now ended. The 2nd
round speaker selection is open, and the deadline for submissions is August
16, 2015.

-----

SecTor &lt;<A HREF="http://www.sector.ca/">http://www.sector.ca/</A>&gt; is searching for a few keynotes as well as
speakers for their upcoming event Oct. 19-Oct. 21, 2015 in Toronto,
Ontario, Canada and has asked for our help.  Last year the event drew just
over 2,000+ attendees and they expect to exceed that number this year.



Below is the information they have sent regarding both keynote and speaker
talks.  To be included in the 2nd round speaker selection, your proposal
submission must be submitted
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.sector.ca/Program/Speakers/Call-for-Speakers">http://www.sector.ca/Program/Speakers/Call-for-Speakers</A>&gt; *prior to August
16, 2015*.



==============================================================



*If you are submitting a speaker/paper please note:*

   1. *SecTor&#8217;s *second round speaker selection deadline is Aug 16th.
   2. SecTor has 3 technical, 1 management and 1 fundamentals tracks. * If
   selected for the technical or management tracks, SecTor will cover travel
   (flight and hotel) costs for your speaker. *
   3. *Absolutely no marketing or product pitches please*.
   4. We always tell prospective speakers to submit more than one paper as
   it is the content that is selected and not the company submitting it.  It
   is possible to have more than one speaking opportunity at SecTor.
   5. Selection is made by majority vote by SecTor's advisory committee.
   6. For more information on past speaking presentations please visit:

   engagements.  Give us an idea of your qualifications.
