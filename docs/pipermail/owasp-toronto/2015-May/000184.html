Hello everyone,

We are pleased to announced our next chapter event after our winter hiatus!
For this month, we will be organizing a panel discussion, rather than
having a formal speaker session, which will hopefully keep things
interesting and engaging!

Please RSVP here

confirm your presence. This is important as it helps us plan the logistics
for the event.

Also, if you are interested in joining the panel, please contact me at

*Date/Time: May 20, 2014, 6:00 - 8:00 PM EDTLocation: Suite 500, 257
Adelaide St. W., Toronto, ON*




*Panel Discussion: State of Application Security in 2015We invite you to
join us at our next OWASP Toronto chapter meeting, where a panel of
industry professionals will discuss the state of application security in
2015. Panelists will share their point of view on a number of topics,
followed by an open discussion with the audience. Come prepared to learn,
discuss, share, and ask questions!*

  1. *Appsec Wishlist*: &quot;If I could have one thing improved in application
  security in 2015, it would be ...&quot;
  2. *Appsec Defenders*: Offensive Security is obviously thriving, but how
  are the Defenders doing? Has there been improvement? There are plenty of
  blackhat/red team rock stars, but are we giving enough credit to the blue
  teams?
  3. *Appsec Tools*: Which application security tools are doing the job
  right? Which ones can be further improved?
  4. *Evolution of Application Security Assessments*: How will the
  industry effect a sea change in attitude towards assessing software for
  security issues? The tunnel-vision model (i.e., black-box only, source code
  review only, configuration review only) is deficient, and the best approach
  is to overlap as many techniques as possible. Time-boxed approaches
  compound the problem, and with the increasing proliferation and complexity
  of applications in any given organization, scaling assessment services to
  all targets is bottlenecked.
  5. *Appsec Talent*: There are too few skilled/trained information
  security professionals, and too much work to do. Scaling up to meet the
  demand can only partially be managed through automation. Where will the
  next wave of reliable security professionals come from? Is training for
  information security skills too expensive in the age Code School? Is North
  Armerica in need of a CREST-like certification to establish a baseline
  level of coverage by a practitioner?
  6. *Internet of Things (IoT) &amp; Appsec*: In the age of the Internet of
  Things (IoT), vendors continue to ship products that fail at meeting basic
  application security concepts - authentication, authorization, auditing;
  confidentiality, integrity, availability; resilience, failure modes, trust
  boundaries. How do we improve the general state of application security for
  IoT?

*Panelists*
To be announced shortly!

Looking forward to seeing and catching up with you all!
