Hi All,

First of we are a little slow this year but are starting our OWASP sessions again and you should see more information around that later this year.

Secondly, as you know, SecTor 2010 will be held October 26 -27, with training on the 25th, in the North Building of the MTCC.  We have a number of exciting plans to make it the best show yet.  Please visit our website at www.sector.ca<http://www.sector.ca> for more information.

SecTor has graciously offered us a special discount coupon IND-OWASP-2010 that will save you 10% off of the conference when registering.  To take advantage of the early bird pricing, please register now.

Early bird pricing till May 15th is $499.

I would also encourage our list members to try and speak at the conference. Don't hesitate responding to the CFP.

Look forward to seeing you all.

Nish

Hi! Is there any security event in May in the Toronto area? I am not
looking for specific APPSEC or OWASP event only, but general security
events, conference, short session at the end of the day etc.
