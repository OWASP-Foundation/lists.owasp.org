Topic: A Distributed Web Application Honeypot 

Time: May 13th 2008, 6:00-7:00 PM EST

Description: DShield.org has been extremely helpful in understanding
network based attacks. However, over the last few years many interesting
attacks target specific web application flaws which are not detected by
DShield's sensor system. Collecting similar data for web applications
has been challenging for a number of reasons. First of all, the data
needed to understand a web application attack is much richer and a
simple efficient data model as the one used by DShield will not provide
sufficient details. If more detailed data, like complete requests, are
collected, data privacy issues become more of a problem. Simple
obfuscation or pattern replacement techniques are usually not sufficient
to safeguard this information, or they will make it impossible to
understand the attack. Lastly, many web application attacks use search
engines to find vulnerable systems, instead of just attacking random
servers. Over the next few months we plan to roll out a distributed web
application honeypot. We will describe how this honeypot will be
implemented to address these issues. 

 

Speaker BIO: Dr. Johannes Ullrich SANS Institute As Chief Research
Officer for the SANS Institute, Johannes is currently responsible for
the SANS Internet Storm Center (ISC) and the GIAC Gold program. He
founded DShield.org in 2000, which is now the data collection engine
behind the ISC. His work with the ISC has been widely recognized, and in
2004, Network World named him one of the 50 most powerful people in the
networking industry. Prior to working for SANS, Johannes worked as a
lead support engineer for a web development company and as a research
physicist. Johannes holds a Ph.D. in Physics from SUNY Albany and is
