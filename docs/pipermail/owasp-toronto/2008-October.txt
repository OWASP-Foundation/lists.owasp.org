Hi All, 

We have our next OWASP meeting coming up. 
Location: The next chapter meeting will be held on November 13th
(Thursday) at D&T, 4-179B, 121 King Street West, Toronto. 
Date/Time: November 13th 2008, 6:00-7:30 PM EST
Title: Web Application Security and the PA-DSS
Description: The Payment Card Industry's (PCI) Payment Application Data
Security Standards (PA-DSS) version 1.1 was released in April 2008, and
has implications for every payment application vendor whose product is
sold, distributed, or licensed "as is". This discussion will provide a
soft introduction to the payment application audit procedures and will
match PA requirements to each phase of the software development
lifecycle. Whether you are a web application developer, tester, vendor
or just interested in PCI and Payment Applications, this talk will have
a message for you. 
Presenter: A M Westgate M.Sc., B.Ed., CISSP, QSA, PA-QSA
BIO: A M brings a range of experience as a security systems analyst, a
software engineer and as an information security instructor. She has
participated in PCI Compliance engagements and PCI gap assessments. In
addition, she has been the primary consultant on PA-DSS Validation, PA
gap assessments and remediation engagements. A M has over 5 years
experience in security software engineering, and has worked in Canada,
USA, Ireland and England. She is a confident speaker, and a part time
instructor of the CISSP preparation course in the continuing education
department at a local university.
