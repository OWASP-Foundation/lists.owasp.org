I'd like to extend to the owasp community an invitationto be a part of 
fsoss/2010 (http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2010/).  This 9th annual Free 
Software and Open Source Symposium will be help October 28-29 this year 
at Seneca College (on the York University campus).  This open web, open 
source and academic partnership event is currently calling for 
presenters (http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2010/PresentationProposal). Aim 
to share the business of open source.  Look forward to having you be a
