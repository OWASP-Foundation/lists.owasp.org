*Date/Time*: February 20, 2019, 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM EST
*Location*: Room 128, St. James Campus - Building A, George Brown College,
200 King Street East, Toronto, ON, M5A 3W8
*Event page*: https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Toronto/events/258798951/

*In Root we trust (no this is not a DNS talk)*

*Abstract*

What do airplanes, TSA pre-check, credit cards, Windows Updates, and HTTPS
all have in common? They all rely on the use of digital certificates as a
basis for the security they provide.

In this talk Pavan and Lisa will share their expertise on what a digital
certificate is, what they can be used for, and why we trust them (or not
trust them in some cases...). They will cover the fundamentals of Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) and shed light on the critical role that Root
Certification Authorities (CAs) play in all of our lives.

This talk is aimed at those who are onboard for HTTPS everywhere but want
to dive into the nuts and bolts of how certificates work and understand the
broader applications of PKI.


*Speaker Bios:*

Pavan

Pavan is a Manager with Deloitte?s Cyber Risk Advisory practice and has
performed and led advisory work across a wide variety of domains with a
focus on network security, vulnerability management, and data protection.

Recently, Pavan?s focus has shifted to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and
the Certification Authorities (CAs) that issue publicly trusted TLS
certificates. He has performed audits of both public and enterprise CAs and
has been an official witness to several root key generation ceremonies both
in Canada and internationally.

While not on an engagement, Pavan attempts to stay up to date on the latest
memes by dedicating his time to mentoring youth at his local Air Cadet
Squadron
