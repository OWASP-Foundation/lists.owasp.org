Hi All TO OWASP members

I am writing to you as the new lead for the Toronto Chapter.  I have
recently joined and decided that I would have some relevant input into this
group as I am responsible for the Application Security offering for IBM.

I am interested in your feedback in what you are looking for from this
group, what you can contribute and any other related suggestions that you
see of value as we go forward.  I would also suggest you start finding out
who of your colleagues are interested and get them to sign up
(<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/local/toronto.html">http://www.owasp.org/local/toronto.html</A>).  We are looking to grow this
group, present at events and become a leading group in this space.

I have received a few emails from the list participants recently and will
respond once I have received more feedback.

I look forward to your responses.

Regards


David Lewis, CISSP
