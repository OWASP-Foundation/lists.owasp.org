Hi Everyone,

For OWASP's ten year anniversary, OWASP would like to make a "Chapters Around the World" video for the keynote speech at AppSecUSA. They have asked each chapter to, if possible, make a short video message saying "Hello from the *** OWASP chapter!"

We are thinking of making this video in front of one of the city's landmarks, the CN Tower. It would be great if OWASP Toronto members could come out in great numbers!

Here are the details:

Location:
CN Tower, 301 Front Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5V 2T6<http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=301+Front+Street+West,+Toronto,+Ontario+M5V+2T6+Canada>
(Note: We will meet at the passenger drop-off location of the CN Tower South Entrance, right on Bremner Boulevard)

Date:
Wednesday, August 17th

Time:
6:00 PM

We are making a 15-20 seconds video, so the whole thing should take less than 30 minutes. Those who are interested can go out for a drink afterwards for some socializing.

If you are planning to come, please RSVP at owasp-rsvp at securitycompass.com<mailto:owasp-rsvp at securitycompass.com>, so we can plan out how many people will be in the video.

Also, stay tuned, plans are underway to have a guest speaker in September. Details will follow shortly!

Hi everyone,

A member pointed out today to me that the RSVP e-mail address was bouncing. We've looked into it and the problem should be fixed now.

If you tried sending a RSVP for the video shoot, but got a delivery failed error, kindly resend it now to owasp-rsvp at securitycompass.com<mailto:owasp-rsvp at securitycompass.com>, that would be greatly appreciated!

See you this evening.

Thanks,
