are very fortunate to have the Project Leaders for OWASP SecurityRAT,
Daniel Kefer and Ren? Reuter, join us to talk about their project.

Looking forward to seeing you all.

*OWASP SecurityRAT: Handling of Security Requirements in Software
Development Lifecycle*

The bigger the company you're working in, the more technologies and
methodologies used by development teams you are going to face. At the same
time, you want to address security risks in an appropriate, reliable and
traceable way for all of them.

After a short introduction of a unified process for handling security
requirements in a large company, the main part of the talk is going to
focus on a tool called SecurityRAT which we developed in order to support
and accelerate this process.


The goal of the tool is first to provide a list of relevant security
requirements according to properties of the developed software (e.g. type
of software, criticality), and afterwards to handle these in a mostly
automated way - integration with an issue tracker being used as a core
feature.

Work in progress (currently targeting mainly integration to other systems,
automated testing of requirements and reporting) as well as future plans
will form the last part of the talk.
