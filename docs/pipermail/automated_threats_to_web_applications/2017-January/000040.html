<PRE>Hi Colin,

I tend to agree with Tin. The word &quot;bypass&quot; makes me think that CAPTCHAs
are still useful against attackers, but perhaps there are ways that my
implementation of CAPTCHA needs to be tightened up. Or, perhaps I need to
ensure all &quot;side routes&quot; into my application are also protected by CAPTCHA
so it cannot be bypassed.

If you search Google for &quot;CAPTCHA Bypass
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.google.com/search?q=captcha+bypass&amp;oq=captcha+bypass&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3199j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=captcha+bypass+service">https://www.google.com/search?q=captcha+bypass&amp;oq=captcha+bypass&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3199j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=captcha+bypass+service</A>&gt;&quot;
a word that appears relatively often is &quot;solve&quot;. I like that word, as well
as the word &quot;defeat&quot; which is what many of the captcha solving services
provide - the ability to *defeat *CAPTCHAs.

Between &quot;CAPTCHA Solving&quot; and &quot;CAPTCHA Defeat&quot; I like the latter, as it
properly helps the reader understand that CAPTCHAs can be defeated not
because they were implemented improperly, but because the CAPTCHA itself,
properly implemented, is simply not effective against motivated attackers.


Best,
Sumit

&gt;<i> Dear all
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In v1.0 we stuck to the rules of using existing terms for each OAT, where
</I>&gt;<i> defined. From the handbook:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The names used, combined with their defining characteristics, are taken
</I>&gt;<i> from existing usage whenever possible. However, terminology is not used
</I>&gt;<i> consistently within the literature sources reviewed, and also in some cases
</I>&gt;<i> it was necessary to use a more generic term that captures the wider idea,
</I>&gt;<i> instead of an individual common name. Furthermore, the intended outcomes of
</I>&gt;<i> the threat action are usually unknown at the time of the action taking
</I>&gt;<i> place, and thus outcome- related names were generally rejected. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, is the creation of a fake account intended for distributing
</I>&gt;<i> malware in user-generated content, or to manipulate search engine scoring,
</I>&gt;<i> or to influence other users, or to explore the authenticated parts of the
</I>&gt;<i> application?*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *... *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Whenever possible, an existing term already used in literature or
</I>&gt;<i> industry usage was preferred, but in many cases, it was difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> identify such a term; as such, in some cases a more generic version had to
</I>&gt;<i> be used. A good example of this is OAT-013 Sniping, where auction sniping
</I>&gt;<i> is the most commonly cited case; it was determined that the characteristics
</I>&gt;<i> of sniping also occur in threat events against other types of applications,
</I>&gt;<i> and the selected name was thus made more general.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Last year Tin asked if we could rename &quot;OAT-009 CAPTCHA Bypass&quot;, as it
</I>&gt;<i> sounds more like an implementation bug, and doesn't really describe what is
</I>&gt;<i> going on. However, it is the term most commonly used to refer to the
</I>&gt;<i> cracking of CAPTCHA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tin wrote:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The intent of this handbook is to cover automated attacks and I believe
</I>&gt;<i> this threat is meant to cover automated CAPTCHA solving, not bypassing per
</I>&gt;<i> se. Bypassing would mean there is a bug in the code that allows either an
</I>&gt;<i> automated program or a human user can go directly to a CAPTCHA-protected
</I>&gt;<i> resource. We can use one of the other names described in the handbook. I
</I>&gt;<i> like CAPTCHA Breaking.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As we move towards v1.2, I wonder if we need to revist this? Does anyone
</I>&gt;<i> think we should rename this OAT? Does anyone think we should not?
