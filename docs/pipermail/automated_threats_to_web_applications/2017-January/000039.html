<PRE>Dear all

In v1.0 we stuck to the rules of using existing terms for each OAT, where
defined. From the handbook:

*The names used, combined with their defining characteristics, are taken
from existing usage whenever possible. However, terminology is not used
consistently within the literature sources reviewed, and also in some cases
it was necessary to use a more generic term that captures the wider idea,
instead of an individual common name. Furthermore, the intended outcomes of
the threat action are usually unknown at the time of the action taking
place, and thus outcome- related names were generally rejected. For
example, is the creation of a fake account intended for distributing
malware in user-generated content, or to manipulate search engine scoring,
or to influence other users, or to explore the authenticated parts of the
application?*

*... *

*Whenever possible, an existing term already used in literature or industry
usage was preferred, but in many cases, it was difficult to identify such a
term; as such, in some cases a more generic version had to be used. A good
example of this is OAT-013 Sniping, where auction sniping is the most
commonly cited case; it was determined that the characteristics of sniping
also occur in threat events against other types of applications, and the
selected name was thus made more general.*


Last year Tin asked if we could rename &quot;OAT-009 CAPTCHA Bypass&quot;, as it
sounds more like an implementation bug, and doesn't really describe what is
going on. However, it is the term most commonly used to refer to the
cracking of CAPTCHA.

Tin wrote:

*The intent of this handbook is to cover automated attacks and I believe
this threat is meant to cover automated CAPTCHA solving, not bypassing per
se. Bypassing would mean there is a bug in the code that allows either an
automated program or a human user can go directly to a CAPTCHA-protected
resource. We can use one of the other names described in the handbook. I
like CAPTCHA Breaking.*


As we move towards v1.2, I wonder if we need to revist this? Does anyone
think we should rename this OAT? Does anyone think we should not?

Thanks, Colin
