Automated Threat project list members

Just a brief note to say the updated handbook is just going through
its first proof read. We hope v1.1 will be released shortly.

By the way, Tin is speaking about the project on Thursday this week at LASCON:

Subject: [Automated_threats_to_web_applications] OWASP Automated Threat
	Handbook - Web Applications v1.1
Message-ID: <CAAxdBB=fLQCPPL=X3m+GJSfSQXiAv0bJ14isJd4R5xMf9Xj5Ow@mail.gmail.com>

Project list members

Further to the work that has been undertaken over the summer, we are
pleased to announce the release of v1.1 of the OWASP Automated Threat
Handbook - Web Applications, which can be downloaded from the usual place:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Automated-threat-handbook.pdf

We will update the document on Lulu, and also release all the source files
in due course. Tin is speaking about the project at 12:00 hrs today at
LASCON.

The changes were previously notified to this list, but primarily include
almost 9,000 extra words about relevant countermeasures.

We look for ward to working with you on v1.2 over the next few months,
which might include one or two new threat events.

Colin Watson and Tin Zaw
Project leaders

Message-ID: <CAAxdBBmjkuRLk=ginSu9En-Mi8G3+6QapjgOgfcrLi5g-Udmhg@mail.gmail.com>

Project list members

Now that v1.1 is out of the way, we can think about v1.2 of the Automated
Threat Handbook which we would like to publish in January.

We expect v1.2 to be a relatively small change but Tin and I will float
some ideas for one or more new OATs via this mailing list. However, there
might be other improvements, errata, etc you think need to be addressed. If
you have any thoughts, please reply to this discussion email and/or comment
on the list we are creating at:

We have requested PWASP that our project be considered for upgrade from
Incubator to Labs status. As the first step, we have to complete an online
form, and I attach what I have drafted so far. This form doesn't show the
content of some larger response, so I copied them in below.

Additional Comments on Project Quality
Automated Threats to Web Applications is one of the few OWASP documentation
projects that publishes its raw source files (in this case Adobe InDesign)
which allows anyone to use the project fully under its free and open
licence.
The project is also referenced by a growing number of vendors in this area
e.g. search "owasp automated threats -site:owasp.org"

Project leaders...
ject leaders are long term OWASP contributors and understand its values and
goals, and conform to applicable laws and regulations in their work and
lives.

Respect and dignity...
All contributions are welcome, encouraged and acknowledged.

Vendor neutral...
Some of the 100% sources of information surveyed include vendor papers, but
the project is neutral on vendors, technologies and countermeasures. No
vendor logos in the outputs or presentations. An approach by a vendor to
sponsor the release of v1.1 was declined since it might be perceived the
project as not being vendor neutral.

Free and open...
Everything is free and open.

Bug tracking...No
Errata and changes are received by email, or identified during proof
reading. All the source Adobe files have been published. There is no
tracking of issues, other than our own notes.
The text additions for v1.1 were produced, edited and reviewed vias Google
doc here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QcULATjxEZLiAmMcNZC4LXwF1yVTEPL3N5IUfKhcRUQ/edit
- this is now read-only.
Changes for v1.2 are being documented here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yW7JBMvkboLt7VDSRQAiN5JqgFq0EF7LgZHqsWDc8vw/edit#



------

If anyone has any comments or changes, please klet me know by the end of
this week when I will submit the form.

Colin
