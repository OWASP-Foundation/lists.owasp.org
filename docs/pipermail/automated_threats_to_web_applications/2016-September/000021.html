FYI &#8211; we just released our State of the Internet (SOTI) report from Q2 -
<A HREF="https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-">https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-</A>
the-internet/akamai-q2-2016-state-of-the-internet-security-report.pdf  In
the DDoS section on page 12, it lists the Attack Vector Frequencies &#8211;





Notice the bottom section as it relates to to Application Layer DoS
attacks.  While the comparative % is quite low vs. lower OSI layer attacks
(only ~1.64%), what is lost here is the raw data.  I just looked back at
that and to give you an idea of the numbers we saw for Q2 which were
flagged as GET, POST or HEAD Flooding it was &#8211; 2924.  So almost 3 thousand
attacks.  That is still a significant number.  We are seeing a lot of
Wordpress sites being used as Patsy Proxies in XML-PRC attacks as well as
many IoT devices being used to launch not only app-layer DDoS but also
Credential Stuffing campaigns as highlighted in my blog post.



On page 33 of our SOTI report, we list data from our Bot Manager (BotMan)
product.  This gives some insights into what we are seeing for the category
of Web Scraping, etc&#8230;  Additionally, we also have this LIVE visualization
from our Client Reputation feed - <A HREF="https://www.akamai.com/us/en/">https://www.akamai.com/us/en/</A>
our-thinking/state-of-the-internet-report/state-of-the-
internet-global-client-reputation-visualization.jsp.  This HEAT Map view
gives you some real-time insights into many automated campaigns for Web DoS
attackers, Scanners, Scrapers, etc&#8230;



Dave &#8211; let me know if you need more data but I agree that if we could get
some form of *Anti-Automation item into the OWASP Top 10* it would be a
good thing as it accurately reflecting attack trends we are seeing on the
battle front.



Thanks,

Ryan

Seems like we should simply reference the threats in Colin's project:
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Automated_Threats_to_Web_Applications">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Automated_Threats_to_Web_Applications</A>

which lists 20 types of automated threats, including those in your list.

Colin (or anyone) - do you have any data/evidence as to the actual
prevalence of these threats?

Hey guys,

Sorry this fell through the cracks but I wanted to bring this back up with
possibly a broadening of scope.  While app-layer DoS/DDoS is certainly a
problem in my view, I think that the overarching issue is really -
*Insufficient
Anti-Automation Defenses*.  If we were to add this as a Top 10 item then we
can include -

- DoS attacks

- Brute Force Authentication attacks

- Web Scraping attacks

- Automated account creation/registration

- Vuln Scanner attacks/recon



The list goes on and on but it all stems from web applications lack of
identification/mitigation of automated processes that attackers use.



What do you think of this idea?

Ryan,



Do you want to volunteer to lead that part of this update? Then you can
figure out how to gather enough data to be meaningful that we can vet, and
then we can use that as input into our calculation model. Your company
could be one source but we'd need at least 3 I would think, possibly more.

I am with Tony on this issue.  My personal perspective is that the OWASP
Top 10 is too reliant upon vulnerability prevalence and doesn&#8217;t have enough
consideration for attack likelihood (mainly due to a lack of data).  *If a
vuln falls in a forest and there is no attacker around to exploit it&#8230;.*
The intersection of vuln prevalence and attack likelihood is the key for
organizations to prioritize which vulns to fix first.



Dave - I too remember the issues of trying to get data from various vendors
the last Top 10 update J  At the time, I was pushing for including
web-based denial of service attacks and need data sets to justify it.  Dave
&#8211; to your point about maybe doing this now, I have since joined one of
those companies (Akamai&#8217;s Threat Research Team) and now have better
leverage as I work on the team that creates our State of the Internet
(SOTI) Security Report J



Please consider a plan for including attack data into the next Top 10.  I
will help any way I can.



Cheers,

Ryan

While diversity is always a concern, I think the project is well known
enough that diversity won't be a problem. If, after 45 days or so, we don't
see the kind of diversity we're expecting, we might specifically reach out
to sources in different communities to get the diversity we are looking for.



And to be clear, we are looking for vulnerability data, not attack data. At
least with this data call. If people want to submit attack data that would
be interesting as well, and that info could be used to help us calculate
the likelihood of (successful) attack. But that's a different angle from
the likelihood of having a vuln in the first place.  We actually discussed
during the last top 10 update if there were any good sources of attack
data, and we couldn't come up with any then. Maybe we can now?

Instead of an open call, how about the following.  Open calls for data
places the level of involvement on the respondent/participant and if there
isn't a diversity in involvement then the data and hence the project
suffers.



Let's map out who is seeing payloads in web requests and ping them for
their data. Vendors in the following space may have logs related to
malicious http requests. These vendors include makers of WAFs, Sec
researchers managing honeypots, IPS manufacturers whose researchers author
web based signatures, even makers of agent based defensive SW that also
have signatures related to web based attacks.   These would be data points
from infrastructure and makers of 'defender' type systems.  Next we could
have another data set from those managing infrastructures in FI, banking,
Federal, Higher Ed, Retail, info services, etc. getting logs from their
SIEMs, can allow us to get logs from practioners.  If they are concerned
about privacy, we can say that their participation can serve as a project
sponsorship and comp them two tickets to regional APPSEC.  Also we can be
transparent with the methodology on how we collect and use their data.  In
reality privacy is really not a factor as most of the legit and malicious
http payloads won't be carrying PII.  We can take both vendor product and
Practioner data and through it up to SumoLogic free instance and run data
analytics against all collected patterns. Sumo has the abilities to has the
ability to hash values from any part of the web request so we can solicit
that in case practioners offering Practioner data are worried about their
collected web requests revealing any info to OWASP project volunteers.



I think that the OWASP Top Ten can finally get an industry support in the
form of diversified data. I think the way to do this is to solicit requests
and 'sell' participation.  Volunteers from the project and new recruits can
have different tasks of recruiting practitioners, tech companies to support
with data contributions or reviewing the data over a free SaaS based data
analytics engine. If left as a call for data, versus project leaders or new
volunteers from OWASP pursuing active data contributions, we may be looking
at less diversified data points.  I would think this more aggressive model
for data inclusion would actually help to make the project even more
marketable.

This is great stuff! Love the open call for data and publishing all the

This is obviously a data call for the next update to the OWASP Top 10,
which is expected to be released in 2017. Looking forward to your input.

The OWASP Top 10 project is launching its effort to update the Top 10
again. The current version was released in 2013, and so this update is
expected to be the 2016 or more likely 2017 release. This time around, we
are making an open data call so anyone with application vulnerability
statistics can contribute their data to the project. To make it easier for
the project to consume this contributed data, we are requesting it be
provided via this Google form.

DEADLINE: Data must be submitted by July 20, 2016.

As an OWASP project, we strive to make everything about every project as
open as possible. For this release of the Top 10, we are going to publish
all the contributed data so that anyone can review it to understand what
input was considered to produce this update, and for other uses as well. We
could imagine other groups/projects making use of this data for other
reasons, so we believe publishing this data will have multiple benefits.

WARNING: You acknowledge that by contributing data to this update of the
Top 10, that you authorize its publication. DO NOT CONTRIBUTE anything you
don&#8217;t want to become public.

Guidance on what data we are looking for:

We are looking for web application vulnerability statistics collected by
your organization:
&#8226; In web applications you assessed.
&#8226; During the years 2014, 2015, or both.
&#8226; These vulnerabilities can be in the code itself, the libraries the
applications use, or in the configuration of the environment the
applications run in.

We are NOT interested in OS, or network level vulnerabilities. We ARE
interested in vulnerabilities in any SQL code running in any databases that
back the applications being assessed and the database accounts used to run
this code, but are generally NOT interested in security issues in the
configuration of the database server itself.

Use your best judgment here to try to keep the data submitted relevant to
the project. If you have a question or aren&#8217;t sure, just ask us for
clarification.

There are 5 pages of questions, most of which are very short. The long one
is page 4, which asks for all the vulnerability statistics. If you prefer,
you can send your answers to the questions on page 4 via email to
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/automated_threats_to_web_applications">dave.wichers at owasp.org</A> but please submit the rest of your input via this
Google form.
