The project has succesfully completed all the changes and additions for
v1.2 of the project's handbook. The PDF can be downloaded from:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Automated-threat-handbook.pdf


Print copies can be purchased at costs from Lulu.com:

ISBN: 978-1-329-42709-9

http://www.lulu.com/shop/owasp-foundation/automated-threat-handbook/paperback/product-23540699.html


Please review it on Lulu if you have a few minutes. We have also updated
the threat identification flowchart:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Oat-ontology-decision-chart.pdf

Furthermore, we have created wiki pages on the OWASP website for each
threat:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Automated_Threat


so each threat now has a unique URL like:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OAT-019_Account_Creation
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OAT-020_Account_Aggregation


The preface to v1.2 states:

*From its original release in 2015, the OWASP Automated Threat Handbook has
now become a **de facto industry standard in detecting and mitigating
threats by malicious web automation. Every bot mitigation vendor and many
buyers of these services now use the ontology defined in this handbook. In
this new version of the OWASP Automated Threat Handbook , the previously
named automated threat event OAT-009 CAPTCHA Bypass has been renamed
OAT-009 CAPTCHA Defeat, and a new threat event OAT-021 Denial of Inventory
has been added.*

*CAPTCHA Bypass was originally used for OAT-009 since this is by far the
most common name used. However, subsequent feedback suggests this is
confusing, since the puzzle is not actually bypassed, but is solved in an
automated manner ? not because the CAPTCHA was implemented improperly, but
because the CAPTCHA itself is simply not effective against motivated
attackers. The name CAPTCHA Defeat has therefore been adopted.*

*Denial of Inventory has been added since its defining characteristics do
not match any of the 20 previously defined automated threat events. This
threat is often seen in ecommerce applications where attackers add items to
their basket to deny them to other users through the creation of **a
stock-out condition, and never actually check out. Similar allocation
without purchase, or payment, or transaction completion, also occur in some
non-ecommerce applications.*

*In addition to these changes, we have acknowledged additional contributors
and reviewers, updated the countermeasures copy, added other names and
examples to several threat events, and made numerous corrections to
grammar, spelling mistakes, and typographical errors.*
