I have begun drafting text for this proposed new OAT to the document:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yW7JBMvkboLt7VDSRQAiN5JqgFq0E
F7LgZHqsWDc8vw/edit#

During our research we have found this 2012 reference to "Denial of
Inventory":

https://arstechnica.com/business/2012/05/has-walmart-opened-itself-up-to-denial-of-inventory-attacks/


If "Denial of Inventory" pre-dates "Inventory Exhaustion", we should
probably use that as the name in the same manner we selected other OAT
names. Does anyone have any citation that use "Inventory exhaustion" in the
context of web applications?

Thanks

Colin

Hi Colin,

Denial of Inventory sounds as sound to me as Inventory Exhaustion. I am OK
with either.

During my AppSec Cali presentation, one participant brought up a potential
new threat, Mining. It is regarding automated mining of virtual resources,
especially for web-based games. I think we should consider it.

Thanks.

Just to add on - we see this exact attack against one of our hotel
customers - the attackers "hold" ALL the rooms at various properties during
high-demand times (for example, hotels near Madison Square Garden during a
major event) which likely has the affect of driving customers to other
hotel chains which appear to have more available inventory.

Thanks, Sumit, for that contribution. We have also seen "hold all" attacks
to augment Scalping in the travel industry.

Hi Guys,
Another contribution from our side - we've seen quite a few Hoarding
campaigns on large retail customers. We've blogged about it with some
information -
https://blog.perimeterx.com/how-hoarder-bots-steal-sales-online-retailers/

Thanks,
Omri

Tin

I have changed the draft name to "Denial of Inventory" for now.

In my mind "mining" (mining of virtual resources, especially for web-based
games) is meant to be part of:

*OAT-006 Expediting* - Perform actions to hasten progress of usually slow,
tedious or time-consuming actions.

*Description*

Using speed to violate explicit or implicit assumptions about the
application?s normal use to achieve unfair individual gain, often
associated with deceit and loss to some other party.
In contrast to OAT-016 Skewing which a ects metrics, Expediting is purely
related to faster progression through a series of application processes.
And OAT-017 Spamming is di erent to Expediting, since the focus of spam is
to add information, and may not involve the concept of process progression.

*Other names and examples*

Algorithmic trading; Automated stock trading; Betting automation; Game
automation; Gaming bot; Gold farming; Financial instrument dealing; High
frequency trading; Purchase automation; Ticketing automation; Trading
automation; Virtual wealth generation bot


Do you think that covers it adequately?

Colin

Subject: [Automated_threats_to_web_applications] Naming of OAT-009 CAPTCHA
	Bypass
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBkUcDSRwHvk8Ef8XRE-MzGpP+S42qX7e7BmMxsRLGT4Jg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

In v1.0 we stuck to the rules of using existing terms for each OAT, where
defined. From the handbook:

*The names used, combined with their defining characteristics, are taken
from existing usage whenever possible. However, terminology is not used
consistently within the literature sources reviewed, and also in some cases
it was necessary to use a more generic term that captures the wider idea,
instead of an individual common name. Furthermore, the intended outcomes of
the threat action are usually unknown at the time of the action taking
place, and thus outcome- related names were generally rejected. For
example, is the creation of a fake account intended for distributing
malware in user-generated content, or to manipulate search engine scoring,
or to influence other users, or to explore the authenticated parts of the
application?*

*... *

*Whenever possible, an existing term already used in literature or industry
usage was preferred, but in many cases, it was difficult to identify such a
term; as such, in some cases a more generic version had to be used. A good
example of this is OAT-013 Sniping, where auction sniping is the most
commonly cited case; it was determined that the characteristics of sniping
also occur in threat events against other types of applications, and the
selected name was thus made more general.*


Last year Tin asked if we could rename "OAT-009 CAPTCHA Bypass", as it
sounds more like an implementation bug, and doesn't really describe what is
going on. However, it is the term most commonly used to refer to the
cracking of CAPTCHA.

Tin wrote:

*The intent of this handbook is to cover automated attacks and I believe
this threat is meant to cover automated CAPTCHA solving, not bypassing per
se. Bypassing would mean there is a bug in the code that allows either an
automated program or a human user can go directly to a CAPTCHA-protected
resource. We can use one of the other names described in the handbook. I
like CAPTCHA Breaking.*


As we move towards v1.2, I wonder if we need to revist this? Does anyone
think we should rename this OAT? Does anyone think we should not?

Thanks, Colin

Hi Colin,

I tend to agree with Tin. The word "bypass" makes me think that CAPTCHAs
are still useful against attackers, but perhaps there are ways that my
implementation of CAPTCHA needs to be tightened up. Or, perhaps I need to
ensure all "side routes" into my application are also protected by CAPTCHA
so it cannot be bypassed.

If you search Google for "CAPTCHA Bypass
<https://www.google.com/search?q=captcha+bypass&oq=captcha+bypass&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3199j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=captcha+bypass+service>"
a word that appears relatively often is "solve". I like that word, as well
as the word "defeat" which is what many of the captcha solving services
provide - the ability to *defeat *CAPTCHAs.

Between "CAPTCHA Solving" and "CAPTCHA Defeat" I like the latter, as it
properly helps the reader understand that CAPTCHAs can be defeated not
because they were implemented improperly, but because the CAPTCHA itself,
properly implemented, is simply not effective against motivated attackers.


Best,
Sumit
