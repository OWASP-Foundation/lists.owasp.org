<PRE>Further to the above. OWASP Top Ten project leader Dave Wichers asked for
our project's input for the text of A7:

   <A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-topten/2017-April/001427.html">http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-topten/2017-April/001427.html</A>

Tin and I have been circulating some ideas around, and have come up with
suggestions for changes to make A7 more inclusive of Abuse/Misuse of
Functionality. A draft of the changes can be seen here:

Pink text is altered sections (we tried to leave the deletions and
additions in red and blue respectively in the first draft), but found this
too messy in a formatted PDF where space is already tight. We would like to
send these suggestions to the Top Ten project shortly, together with the
following covering email:

=================================================

Dave

Further to your request for assistance with making the text of A7 more
inclusive of our projects automated threats, as well as all four of the
issues you mentioned.

We have not attempted to address anyone else's concerns with A7, but should
note that our project is technology and vendor agnostic, and our suggested
changes to the wording of A7 avoid the mention of specific technologies, or
products, or services. We welcome the Top Ten project's attempt to raise
awareness of automated threat weaknesses/vulnerabilities that often go
un-mentioned, yet are of real concern, and impact, to application owners.

1. Full page text

We realise there are constraints on space, and therefore we have mocked up
an updated page to ensure our suggested changes would fit in. Changes
sections are marked in the colour magenta in the PNG at
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-a7-suggestions.png">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-a7-suggestions.png</A>

2. Short description

The short description of A7 on page 7 of RC1 does not seem to include all
the issues A7 is meant to include. It is currently &quot;The majority of
applications and APIs lack the basic ability to detect, prevent, and
respond to both manual and automated attacks. Attack protection goes far
beyond basic input validation and involves automatically detecting,
logging, responding, and even blocking exploit attempts. Application owners
also need to be able to deploy patches quickly to protect against
attacks.&quot;. Our project believes it might be better as: &quot;The majority of
applications and APIs lack the basic ability to detect, prevent and respond
to manual and automated attacks. This includes insufficient attack
detection, insufficient attack response, insufficient countermeasures
against automated threats, and insufficient ability to patch quickly.&quot;

3. Title

Whilst of course we would have liked to see &quot;Insufficient Anti-Automation&quot;
as a single issue, we accept your project's desire to aggregate this with
some other issues. We do not mind too much the name &quot;Insufficient Attack
Protection&quot; but it may suggest to some it is more of an operational thing
rather than encompassing the many countermeasures that can be considered
through the whole of the software development life cycle. Yes there are
design flaws and implementation bugs in this item!  Our project has not
been able to come up with a better title that includes all the aspects to
be considered. Most Top Ten issues are 3-4 words long, although we note
that A1 is just &quot;Injection&quot;. One suggestion - which we feel is weak - is
simply to name A7 &quot;Automation&quot;, but this is a poor munging together of
meaning: a) Automated attacks and b) Automation of detection and response
defenses [to both manual and automated attacks]. However, it does remove
any other descriptive and thus judgemental words.

=================================================

Does anyone else have corrections, suggestions or further improvements from
our Automated Threats perspective, before we send this to the Top Ten
mailing list?
