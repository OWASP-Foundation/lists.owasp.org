Subject: [Automated_threats_to_web_applications] Data point: $250million
	Instagram fraud in 2017 due to automation
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBnWppqADQBcp41DS3Axqknkv7Lhnj0wN16-Vc1YpG+H3A@mail.gmail.com>

A data point for quantifying automated threats:

"That strategy has not worked. In 2017, brands spent $2.1 billion on
influencer-sponsored posts on Instagram, or 6.6 million posts at an average
price of $325. On average, more than 11% of the engagement for these posts
was generated by fraudulent accounts. That's nearly a quarter of a billion
dollars in wasted marketing dollars."
