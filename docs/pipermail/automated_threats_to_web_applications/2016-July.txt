Automated Threats list members

I am pleased to announce that long-term OWASP volunteer and contributor Tin
Zaw is joining the "Automated Threats to Web Applications" project as
co-leader. Initially Tin is using his industry experience and taking charge
of updating the Handbook, to provide additional generic vendor-neutral
guidance aimed at builders and defenders for each of the threats. We are
hoping to publish an updated version in the next few months. After that,
Tin is looking to help enhance the project further.

If anyone has thoughts on guidance for developers & builders, or has
additional contributions or corrections, please share them with us,
preferably through this list, or directly to either of us if you prefer. I
have some errata sent in October by an existing contributor which we will
fix.

Regards

Colin Watson
Automated Threats to Web Applications co-leader

Hi Colin,

Thank you for the kind introduction. I will do my best to take this project
further together.

Hi Claudia,

Yes, I did sign up to do booth duty for OWASP at Black Hat. I would like to
discuss about this project, and more importantly solicit feedback, but
since this project is a documentation project, it would be a
presentation/discussion instead of a demo.

Please let me know if it is possible to have a presentation about this
project.

PS. Colin, are there still printed copies of this project? Sometimes, hard
copies get attention better. Or at least a one-page project sheet (hard
copy) with pointer to the OWASP page.

Thanks!

Tin

The copies of the handbook I took to AppSec USA last year all went. But the
current version is available from Lulu. I also have a design for a
two-sided information leaflet. Maybe there is still time to get some copies
purchased from Lulu? The project doesn't have any money, but we could bid
for some funds to cover this.

Claudia

I was thinking the "outreach" aspect of the Community Engagement Fund:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Funding

Why can't we just apply for that?

What is this other funding option you are looking at, and where is it
defined on the OWASP wiki? What are the application criteria?

Colin

Hi Colin,

I checked Lulu press and they have version 1 in print. Is it the latest
version we have?

http://www.lulu.com/shop/owasp-foundation/automated-threat-handbook/paperback/product-22295560.html

Based on your experience at AppSec USA, how many copies do you think will
be needed at Black Hat? We want to spread it but want it to go into right
hands. I am thinking like 100 one-pagers and about 40-50 books.

What do you think? (I may be able to ask LA chapter to fund a little too).

Thanks.

I can also see if we can get some funds from the OWASP Foundation.  Also,
looking to add funds to print the Snakes and Ladder game.

Please send me the cost and we can chat on the total funds needed.

Hello TIn,

What is the cost for the printing that you need?  We can use the credit
card to make the purchase?

Hi Claudia,

If OWASP will reimburse, I can use my credit to print. I estimate the cost
to be around $600 (500 for 50 books and 100 for 100 sheets).

Let me know if I should go ahead with ordering. We only have a few days
left.

Thanks.

Claudia,

I believe the CFP for AppSec USA is closed now but I wonder if there is any
slot left for OWASP project. If so, we would like to get a slot to discuss
ver 1.1 of the book.

If you are not the right person, could you point us to the right person?

Thanks.
