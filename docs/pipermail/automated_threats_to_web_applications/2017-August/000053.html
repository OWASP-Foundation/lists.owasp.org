<PRE>Please see below a link to a survey about the OWASP Top ten 2017. The
survey asks for a ranking of possible new additions. Ones relevant to the
Automated Threats to Web Applications project are:

   - Improper Control of Interaction Frequency (Anti-Automation) [CWE-799]
   <A HREF="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/799.html">http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/799.html</A>
   - Application Denial of Service [CWE-400]
   <A HREF="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html">https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html</A>

and possibly:

   - Insufficient Logging and Monitoring [CWE-223 / CWE-778]
   <A HREF="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/223.html">https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/223.html</A>
   <A HREF="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/778.html">https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/778.html</A>

Please complete the survey (<A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/ltbKrdYrp4Qdl7Df2">https://goo.gl/forms/ltbKrdYrp4Qdl7Df2</A>) using
your own experience, and if you have supporting data, see the call for data.

Thanks, Colin

The following is from <A HREF="https://owasp.blogspot.com/2017/08/owasp-top-10-2017-">https://owasp.blogspot.com/2017/08/owasp-top-10-2017-</A>
project-update.html.

The OWASP Top 10 is the most heavily referenced, most heavily used, and
most heavily downloaded document at OWASP. Therefore, it rightfully has a
greater level of scrutiny and a greater level of review as befitting a
Flagship project.


The previous Top 10 leaders have passed the baton for this project on to a
new team and we will strive to address the feedback that has been provided
over the past few months. We have discussed as a team and at the OWASP
Summit what steps must be taken and what changes must be made to the OWASP
Top 10.


A summary of changes is listed below, please read further to understand
more of the why behind them:

   - The Top 10 will focus on Vulnerability Categories.
   - Feedback on the mailing list has been moved to the Issues List (
   <A HREF="https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues">https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues</A>
   &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues">https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues</A>&gt;) in GitHub, please continue to
   contribute feedback there. &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues">https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues</A>&gt;
   - The content of the document will be extracted to provide easier
   translations.
   - Scoring for Top 10 entries is intended to be based on Common Weakness
   Scoring System (CWSS)
   - For the 2017 Edition, 8 of 10 vulnerabilities will be selected from
   data submitted via the call for data and 2 of 10 will be selected from an
   industry-ranked survey.
   - A ranked survey (<A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/ltbKrdYrp4Qdl7Df2">https://goo.gl/forms/ltbKrdYrp4Qdl7Df2</A>) is now
   available for industry professionals to select two new vulnerability
   categories for inclusion in the Top 10 2017. The deadline for the survey is
   30 August, 2017.
   - The call for data (<A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/tLgyvK9O74r7wMkt2">https://goo.gl/forms/tLgyvK9O74r7wMkt2</A>) is now
   reopened to allow for additional data to be collected for analysis. The new
   deadline for the extended data call is 18 September, 2017.
   - The Top 10 2017 RC2 will released for review and feedback 9 October,
   2017.
   - The final release of the Top 10 2017 is targeted for 18 November, 2017.



[image: OWASP Top10 Timeline-v2.png]


The OWASP Top 10 has always been about missing controls, flawed controls,
or working controls that haven&#8217;t been used, which when present are commonly
called vulnerabilities. We have traditionally linked the OWASP Top 10 into
the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list maintained by NIST / MITRE. We
will continue to align with CWEs and utilize the CWSS scoring system to
help provide an industry standard measurement.
For the Top 10 2017, we will be focusing on vulnerability categories. These
categories will be mapped to one or more CWEs where possible. The scoring
system for the Top 10 will be updated to leverage the CWSS as much as
feasible. Like the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) for specific
Common Vulnerabilities &amp; Exposures (CVEs), we are intending to use CWSS for
vulnerability categories. In the scenario where there are multiple CWEs, we
will use the high-water mark; if there is a vulnerability category without
a matching CWE, we will do what we can to align a CWSS score.
Although the OWASP Top 10 is partially data-driven, there is also a need to
be forward looking. At the OWASP Summit we agreed that for the 2017
Edition, eight of the Top 10 will be data-driven from the public call for
data and two of the Top 10 will be forward looking and driven from a survey
of industry professionals. The OWASP Top 10 will clearly identify which
items are forward looking: we will use the CWSS score of these items (if a
CWE for the issue exists) or our best judgement on where the issue will be
ranked in the Top 10.


The extended call for data can be accessed here: <A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/">https://goo.gl/forms/</A>
tLgyvK9O74r7wMkt2
The two items that are not data-driven will be supported by a qualitative
survey. The survey is comprised of vulnerability categories that were
identified as &#8220;on the cusp,&#8221; mailing list feedback, and previous call for
data feedback. Respondents should rank the top four most important
vulnerability categories from their knowledge and experience. The two
vulnerability categories with the total highest ranking will be included in
the Top 10 2017. The information will also help us develop a plan to better
structure the call for data for the OWASP Top 10 2020.


The survey can be accessed here: <A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/ltbKrdYrp4Qdl7Df2">https://goo.gl/forms/ltbKrdYrp4Qdl7Df2</A>


Every single issue in the OWASP Top 10 should have a direct cause: either
one or more missing or ineffective controls, or not using an in place
control. Every issue should be precise in its language and view (as in not
intermingling the terms &#8220;weakness,&#8221; &#8220;vulnerability,&#8221; &#8220;threat,&#8221; &#8220;risk,&#8221; or
&#8220;defect&#8221;) so each issue can be theoretically testable. This will help us
make a stronger and more defensible list of included items.
We aim to review and resolve ontological concerns, such as including issues
that are not like the others. This means that in some circumstances, there
should be a view from the Developer perspective (documented by the OWASP
Proactive Controls) and a view for the Defending Blue Team (documented by
the currently non-existent OWASP Defensive Controls).
Every issue should contain clear and effective advice on remediation,
deterrence, delay and detection that can be adopted by any development team
- no matter how small or how large. As the OWASP Top 10 are important
vulnerability categories, we should strive to make our advice easy to
follow and easily translatable into other languages.
&gt;<i>From a methodology point of view, we are looking at taking lessons learned
</I>from 2017 and coming up with a better process for the OWASP Top 10 in 2020.
We would like to coordinate with other teams to provide a staggered release
of the other OWASP Top 10 efforts with sufficient time between each release
to allow the industry to upgrade and adopt in a practical way.
Lastly, we are opening up the text to provide history and traceability. We
need to ensure that all of the issues documented within any of the various
Flagship projects, but particularly the OWASP Top 10, can be satisfied by
developers and devops engineers without recourse to paid tools or services.
There is value in the use of paid services and tools, but as an open (as in
free and in liberty) organization, the OWASP Top 10 should have a low
barrier of entry, and high effectiveness of any suggested remediations.
Thank you, and we look forward to working with you on the OWASP Top 10.
