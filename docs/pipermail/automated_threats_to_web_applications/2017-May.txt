Further to the above. OWASP Top Ten project leader Dave Wichers asked for
our project's input for the text of A7:

   http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-topten/2017-April/001427.html

Tin and I have been circulating some ideas around, and have come up with
suggestions for changes to make A7 more inclusive of Abuse/Misuse of
Functionality. A draft of the changes can be seen here:

Pink text is altered sections (we tried to leave the deletions and
additions in red and blue respectively in the first draft), but found this
too messy in a formatted PDF where space is already tight. We would like to
send these suggestions to the Top Ten project shortly, together with the
following covering email:

=================================================

Dave

Further to your request for assistance with making the text of A7 more
inclusive of our projects automated threats, as well as all four of the
issues you mentioned.

We have not attempted to address anyone else's concerns with A7, but should
note that our project is technology and vendor agnostic, and our suggested
changes to the wording of A7 avoid the mention of specific technologies, or
products, or services. We welcome the Top Ten project's attempt to raise
awareness of automated threat weaknesses/vulnerabilities that often go
un-mentioned, yet are of real concern, and impact, to application owners.

1. Full page text

We realise there are constraints on space, and therefore we have mocked up
an updated page to ensure our suggested changes would fit in. Changes
sections are marked in the colour magenta in the PNG at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-a7-suggestions.png

2. Short description

The short description of A7 on page 7 of RC1 does not seem to include all
the issues A7 is meant to include. It is currently "The majority of
applications and APIs lack the basic ability to detect, prevent, and
respond to both manual and automated attacks. Attack protection goes far
beyond basic input validation and involves automatically detecting,
logging, responding, and even blocking exploit attempts. Application owners
also need to be able to deploy patches quickly to protect against
attacks.". Our project believes it might be better as: "The majority of
applications and APIs lack the basic ability to detect, prevent and respond
to manual and automated attacks. This includes insufficient attack
detection, insufficient attack response, insufficient countermeasures
against automated threats, and insufficient ability to patch quickly."

3. Title

Whilst of course we would have liked to see "Insufficient Anti-Automation"
as a single issue, we accept your project's desire to aggregate this with
some other issues. We do not mind too much the name "Insufficient Attack
Protection" but it may suggest to some it is more of an operational thing
rather than encompassing the many countermeasures that can be considered
through the whole of the software development life cycle. Yes there are
design flaws and implementation bugs in this item!  Our project has not
been able to come up with a better title that includes all the aspects to
be considered. Most Top Ten issues are 3-4 words long, although we note
that A1 is just "Injection". One suggestion - which we feel is weak - is
simply to name A7 "Automation", but this is a poor munging together of
meaning: a) Automated attacks and b) Automation of detection and response
defenses [to both manual and automated attacks]. However, it does remove
any other descriptive and thus judgemental words.

Does anyone else have corrections, suggestions or further improvements from
our Automated Threats perspective, before we send this to the Top Ten
mailing list?

Colin & Tin -

I think you've done some great work here - thank you for taking the lead
and putting energy into this important topic.

It is hard to know the best way to properly frame this issue so that it
makes sense in the context of the top 10. I am worried that as currently
written, A7 is too confusing to produce much benefit for security
practitioners. I consider the following two facets of this topic to be the
most important:

*1. Attacks rely on legitimate functionality:*
the 'attacks' in almost all cases involve requests which are valid and
legitimate (such as a credential stuffing attack, which involves seemingly
valid login requests). This is a major shift towards such attacks because
of the widespread availability of useful data (like usernames/passwords).

*2. Attacks require automation:*
Few attacks which rely solely on legitimate functionality produce a benefit
if performed manually. Most require automation in order to produce economic
ROI (which is the primary sustained persistent reason for these types of
attacks). Currently A7 continues to mention "and manual" which I think is a
major flaw. While "manual" attacks against legitimate functionality are
certainly a possibility, they are not in practice causing the kinds of
problems that automated attacks are causing.

I have some specific thoughts on your bullets 1-3 which I'll share later,
but wanted to share these initial thoughts now.

Thanks,
Sumit

I agree with what you are saying, but this is a response to change the
wording of the existing A7, not change A7 by spitting it. I think the
decision to put these things together is separate. We should perhaps at
least allude to that though, and offer our own alternatives for two
different risks?

Colin

comments? I have made some changes CAPITLISED below.

Please note there is nothing to stop anyone providing their own different,
similar, contrasting, or additional comments directly to the Top Ten

Colin


=================================================

Dave

Further to your request for assistance with making the text of A7 more
inclusive of our project's automated threats, as well as all four of the
issues you mentioned.

WE FEEL THAT INCLUDING OTHER RISKS IN A7 TOGETHER WITH "Insufficient
Anti-Automation", DILUTES THIS IMPORTANT COMMON AND EASILY EXPLOITABLE
RISK, AND MAY INCREASE CONFUSION ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THE VARIOUS ISSUES.
HOWEVER, FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS REPLY WE ASSUME A7 WILL CONTINUE TO BE
THE STATED AGGREGATION OF RISKS.

We have not attempted to address anyone else's concerns with A7, but should
note that our project is technology and vendor agnostic, and our suggested
changes to the wording of A7 avoid the mention of specific technologies, or
products, or services. We welcome the Top Ten project's attempt to raise
awareness of automated threat weaknesses/vulnerabilities that often go
un-mentioned, yet are of real concern, and impact, to application owners.

1. Full page text

We realise there are constraints on space, and therefore we have mocked up
an updated page to ensure our suggested changes would fit in. Changes
sections are marked in the colour magenta in the PNG at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-a7-suggestions.png

2. Short description

The short description of A7 on page 7 of RC1 does not seem to include all
the issues A7 is meant to include. It is currently "The majority of
applications and APIs lack the basic ability to detect, prevent, and
respond to both manual and automated attacks. Attack protection goes far
beyond basic input validation and involves automatically detecting,
logging, responding, and even blocking exploit attempts. Application owners
also need to be able to deploy patches quickly to protect against
attacks.". BASED ON YOUR OTHER EMAILS TO THE TOP TEN LIST, our project
believes it might be better as: "The majority of applications and APIs lack
the basic ability to detect, prevent and respond to manual and automated
attacks. This includes insufficient attack detection, insufficient attack
response, insufficient countermeasures against automated threats, and
insufficient ability to patch quickly."

3. Title

Whilst of course we would have liked to see "Insufficient Anti-Automation"
as a single issue, we accept your project's desire to aggregate this with
some other issues. We do not mind too much the name "Insufficient Attack
Protection" but it may suggest to some it is more of an operational thing,
rather than encompassing the many countermeasures that can be considered
through the whole of the software development life cycle. Yes there are
design flaws and implementation bugs in this item!  Our project has not
been able to come up with a SUGGESTED better title that includes all the
aspects to be considered. Most Top Ten issues are 3-4 words long, although
we note that A1 is just "Injection". One suggestion - which we feel is weak
- is simply to name A7 "Automation", but this is a poor munging together of
meaning: a) Automated attacks and b) Automation of detection and response
defenses [to both manual and automated attacks]. However, it does remove
any other descriptive and thus judgemental words.
