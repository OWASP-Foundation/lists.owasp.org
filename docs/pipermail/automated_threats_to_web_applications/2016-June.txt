Automated Threat list members

I saw this message on the OWASP leaders list:

   http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2016-June/016870.html

It points to this new paper:

   https://www.imperva.com/docs/IMPERVA_WP_OWASP_Automated_Attacks.pdf

The name/title is incorrect since the threats listed in the "Automated
Threats to Web Applications Handbook" is neither finite nor even ordered
list. Despite that I believe it is encouraging the automated threat terms
are being used in industry. It is one of the use cases.

I will also reply to the message on the Leaders' list.

Regards

Colin Watson
OWASP Automated Threats to Web Applications project leader
