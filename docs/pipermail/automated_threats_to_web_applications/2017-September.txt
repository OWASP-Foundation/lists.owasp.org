	has been graduated to Lab status

Dear contributors,

I would like to announce that our project has been graduated to be a Lab
project upon completing a successful review at OWASP Project Summit last
week.

According to OWASP definition, Labs projects represent projects that have
produced a deliverable of value. While these projects are typically not
production ready, the OWASP community expects that an OWASP Labs project
leader is producing releases that are at least ready for mainstream usage.

The main product of our project, OWASP Automated Threat Handbook, has
become a de facto industry standard in detecting and mitigating threats by
malicious web automation. Every bot mitigation vendor and many buyers of
these services now use the ontology defined in the handbook these days. For
that, we are thankful for your contributions and proud of our achievement
together.

Our next goal, naturally, is to become an OWASP Flagship project that
demonstrates strategic value to OWASP and application security as a whole.
Our plan is to achieve that status during next project review in 2018.

Thank you for all your contributions!

I am going to add "[We understand the ] OWASP Automated Threat Handbook has

the preface!
