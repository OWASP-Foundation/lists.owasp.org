Subject: [Automated_threats_to_web_applications] A7 in the OWASP Top Ten
	2017 RC1
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBkh=U35OZpLxpTc-=GXKXq+TAz=RYPBEcf79XfkCrf3fg@mail.gmail.com>

The OWASP Top Ten Project has issued a release candidate. More information
in their mailing list posts this month:

http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-topten/2017-April/thread.html

The document is at:

https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/raw/master/2017/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202017%20RC1-English.pdf

A7 includes a brief mention of Automated Threats Project as one of the
references. If anyone has any feedback, we can discuss things here, or you
can provide feedback to the Top Ten Project mailing list directly.

Colin

I have sent a message to the Top 10 project's mailing list suggesting there
is less coverage of automated threats in the 2017 RC1 than in the previous
2013 edition:

Feel free to submit your own thoughts on their mailing list!

Thank you for the feedback.

CAPTCHA Defeat has been used for OAT-009 in the draft changes for v1.2 - we
are expecting to publish that in early June 2017.
