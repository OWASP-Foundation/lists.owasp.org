Subject: [Automated_threats_to_web_applications] Update to the Handbook
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBko=vkhUy1sCt2ntu4y8W7mPWUuiynndwxqqCk32LXrvA@mail.gmail.com>

Automated Threats project list members

Tin and I have been working on updating the symptoms for each OWASP
Automated Threat, and have also been writing content for
countermeasures. Tin has just emailed the OWASP leaders list about
this. See:

   http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2016-October/017390.html

Please view the referenced document and provide your additions,
feedback and corrections.

We are also taking the opportunity to make some legibility, design and
spelling improvements - the changes are all listed below. Thank you
for the feedback about these from some of you. We plan to release v1.1
at the start of November.

Regards

Colin and Tin
OWASP Automated Threats to Web Application project leaders
