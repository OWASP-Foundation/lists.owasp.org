<PRE>Further to my previous email message, we have been adding errata and
changes to the list in the Google Document referenced.

*Which OAT?*

I have also today created a first attempt at an &quot;automated threat event
identification flowchart&quot;, which can be found here:

   <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Oat-ontology-decision-chart.pdf">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Oat-ontology-decision-chart.pdf</A>

I am sure this can be improved with your help, so if you have any
suggestions please pass them on.

*New OAT?*

As you might notice on that flowchart, we have added a possible 21st OAT,
with the draft name of &quot;Inventory Exhaustion&quot;. This suggestion for a new
OAT came up during the work for v1.1 but Tin and I wanted longer to discuss
it with other people on this list. The idea is making goods or services
unavailable to legitimate users, without actually purchasing. In e-commerce
this could be creating adding limited stock to one or more shopping
baskets, but never checking out. Therefore, it is not exhaustion of
application system resources (OAT-015 Denial of service), and not Scalping
(OAT-005 Scalping) since in that the intention is to resell them.

As people interested in this project:

* Do you think this threat event is different enough to any existing OAT
and therefore be added as a new OAT?
* Or is it really an example of an existing OAT?
* Any other thoughts?
* If added as new, is &quot;Inventory Exhaustion&quot; or &quot;Inventory Exhausting&quot; okay
as a short name, or would you suggest something else, or is there a name
already in use which we should copy?

Thanks for your help,

Colin
