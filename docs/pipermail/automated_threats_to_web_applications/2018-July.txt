Last week the UK newspaper Guardian ran a story about fraud attacks on
mobile-only bank Monzo:

Fraud: here's how scammers get away with it
https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jul/07/heres-how-scammers-get-away-with-it?

I added the following to the comments section:

The article mentions "*pan enumeration attack*" which possibly was meant to
> be "PAN enumeration attack" (PAN=Primary Account Number, often used for
> card account number), and goes on to describe:
>
> > *This is where fraudsters, often based overseas, bombard a bank?s
> computers, trying to guess passwords and logins, or attempting to do
> transactions by generating card expiry dates and three-digit CVCs (card
> verification codes) in the hope that some might break through.*
>
> This would seem to be two types of automated threat defined in the free
> [OWASP Automated Threat Handbook](
> https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Automated_Threats_to_Web_Applications
> )
>
> * [OAT-010 Card Cracking](
> https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OAT-010_Card_Cracking) - Identify missing
> start/expiry dates and security codes for stolen payment card data by
> trying different values.
> * [OAT-007 Credential Cracking](
> https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OAT-007_Credential_Cracking) - Identify
> valid login credentials by trying different values for usernames and/or
> passwords.
>
> One of the purposes of the research to create an ontology and publication
> of the handbook, was to provide a common language to discuss and share
> information about such threats.

The UK's Digital Economy Act 2017 came into force this month, and includes
measures to make it illegal to attempt to purchase multiple tickets for a
recreational, sporting or cultural event in the United Kingdom, when they
are purchased online and limits per person are stated:

Subject: [Automated_threats_to_web_applications] Supporting data for OAT-008
	Credential Stuffing
Message-ID: <CAAxdBB=wN1ek7p3PeJNdLcpPvUA7gmUy3_SjAegR=15P2_pe9A@mail.gmail.com>

It is often difficult to undertake automated threat risk assessments or
attempt to quantitatively define the potential impact of attacks due to
lack of data. It is hard to keep track of publicised attacks, but the
following report includes useful data:

http://info.shapesecurity.com/rs/935-ZAM-778/images/Shape_Credential_Spill_Report_2018.pdf

There is information on the number of accounts compromised per successful
known attack, effects on retailer website traffic, lifecycle of attacks,
exploitation of validated credentials (including OAT-012 Cashing Out and
OAT-011 Scraping), and some estimates of the typical costs OAT-008
Credential Stuffing attacks have by sector.
