Subject: [Automated_threats_to_web_applications] Project Flyer v0.72
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBkLOQ4ctu3OP06+Am5xYJ9etNDMUGVNdj0JSYZotn=7dw@mail.gmail.com>

A 2-page flyer was uploaded in June. This has now been updated:

   v0.72
   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Automation-project-briefing.pdf

Note that another threat as been added - "Account Aggregation" used to
form part of scraping, but has been elevated to its own separate term.
I have used the following short description for this:

   Use by an intermediary application to collect together accounts and
interact on their behalves.

If anyone has any corrections, suggestions or comments, please let me
know. I am aiming to release v1.0 in mid July.

Regards

Subject: [Automated_threats_to_web_applications] Automated Threat Handbook
	draft v0.73
Message-ID: <CAAxdBB=tq_XncCBJuQE1CskgNGXT_nEFq3VP90Ns8uCDvvopRA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members

I have worked the project up further and am getting close to releasing
a v1.0 document. There is a project summary here:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Automation-project-briefing.pdf

And my main document is:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Automated-threat-handbook.pdf

This is still a draft - I need to do the covers, add symptoms, fix the
fuzzy images, and do some proof reading.

If anyone has time to review this, or suggest symptoms for each threat
event, please let me know, or share this with the mailing list. I am
hoping to release v1.0 later this month.

Regards

Colin

Subject: [Automated_threats_to_web_applications] v1.00 Automated Threat
	Handbook
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBnky7PJoUeaKUjaSR-MparG7DwoVA8Hze3secLfWq3cRw@mail.gmail.com>

I have complketed and published the v1.00 documents. There is a
two-page project summary at:

    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Automation-project-briefing.pdf

The v1.00 handbook itself can be downloaded as a PDF from:

    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Automated-threat-handbook.pdf  or

obtained as a print on demand book at:

    http://www.lulu.com/shop/owasp-foundation/automated-threat-handbook/paperback/product-22295560.html

I have just ordered some proof copies of the above from Lulu to make
sure they are correct.

As this is a new project, and I want to attract additional
contributors, I emailed the main OWASP Leaders' list with an overview:
