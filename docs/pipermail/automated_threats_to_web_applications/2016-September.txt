Automated Threat list members

Please see below a request from Dave Wichers of the OWASP Top Ten Project
for any prevalence data relating to the threats in our handbook. If so,
please can you contact the Top Ten project as soon as possible.

Note: I believe they want prevalence in applications rather than frequency
of attack data.

Regards

Colin

Seems like we should simply reference the threats in Colin's project:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Automated_Threats_to_Web_Applications

which lists 20 types of automated threats, including those in your list.

Colin (or anyone) - do you have any data/evidence as to the actual
prevalence of these threats?

FYI ? we just released our State of the Internet (SOTI) report from Q2 -
https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-
the-internet/akamai-q2-2016-state-of-the-internet-security-report.pdf  In
the DDoS section on page 12, it lists the Attack Vector Frequencies ?





Notice the bottom section as it relates to to Application Layer DoS
attacks.  While the comparative % is quite low vs. lower OSI layer attacks
(only ~1.64%), what is lost here is the raw data.  I just looked back at
that and to give you an idea of the numbers we saw for Q2 which were
flagged as GET, POST or HEAD Flooding it was ? 2924.  So almost 3 thousand
attacks.  That is still a significant number.  We are seeing a lot of
Wordpress sites being used as Patsy Proxies in XML-PRC attacks as well as
many IoT devices being used to launch not only app-layer DDoS but also
Credential Stuffing campaigns as highlighted in my blog post.



On page 33 of our SOTI report, we list data from our Bot Manager (BotMan)
product.  This gives some insights into what we are seeing for the category
of Web Scraping, etc?  Additionally, we also have this LIVE visualization
from our Client Reputation feed - https://www.akamai.com/us/en/
our-thinking/state-of-the-internet-report/state-of-the-
internet-global-client-reputation-visualization.jsp.  This HEAT Map view
gives you some real-time insights into many automated campaigns for Web DoS
attackers, Scanners, Scrapers, etc?



Dave ? let me know if you need more data but I agree that if we could get
some form of *Anti-Automation item into the OWASP Top 10* it would be a
good thing as it accurately reflecting attack trends we are seeing on the
battle front.



Thanks,

Ryan

Hey guys,

Sorry this fell through the cracks but I wanted to bring this back up with
possibly a broadening of scope.  While app-layer DoS/DDoS is certainly a
problem in my view, I think that the overarching issue is really -
*Insufficient
Anti-Automation Defenses*.  If we were to add this as a Top 10 item then we
can include -

- DoS attacks

- Brute Force Authentication attacks

- Web Scraping attacks

- Automated account creation/registration

- Vuln Scanner attacks/recon



The list goes on and on but it all stems from web applications lack of
identification/mitigation of automated processes that attackers use.



What do you think of this idea?

The intersection of vuln prevalence and attack likelihood is the key for

Dave - I too remember the issues of trying to get data from various vendors
the last Top 10 update J  At the time, I was pushing for including
web-based denial of service attacks and need data sets to justify it.  Dave
? to your point about maybe doing this now, I have since joined one of
those companies (Akamai?s Threat Research Team) and now have better
leverage as I work on the team that creates our State of the Internet

Please consider a plan for including attack data into the next Top 10.  I
will help any way I can.

While diversity is always a concern, I think the project is well known
enough that diversity won't be a problem. If, after 45 days or so, we don't
see the kind of diversity we're expecting, we might specifically reach out
to sources in different communities to get the diversity we are looking for.



And to be clear, we are looking for vulnerability data, not attack data. At
least with this data call. If people want to submit attack data that would
be interesting as well, and that info could be used to help us calculate
the likelihood of (successful) attack. But that's a different angle from
the likelihood of having a vuln in the first place.  We actually discussed
during the last top 10 update if there were any good sources of attack
data, and we couldn't come up with any then. Maybe we can now?

Let's map out who is seeing payloads in web requests and ping them for
their data. Vendors in the following space may have logs related to
malicious http requests. These vendors include makers of WAFs, Sec
researchers managing honeypots, IPS manufacturers whose researchers author
web based signatures, even makers of agent based defensive SW that also
have signatures related to web based attacks.   These would be data points
from infrastructure and makers of 'defender' type systems.  Next we could
have another data set from those managing infrastructures in FI, banking,

transparent with the methodology on how we collect and use their data.  In
reality privacy is really not a factor as most of the legit and malicious
http payloads won't be carrying PII.  We can take both vendor product and
Practioner data and through it up to SumoLogic free instance and run data
analytics against all collected patterns. Sumo has the abilities to has the
ability to hash values from any part of the web request so we can solicit
that in case practioners offering Practioner data are worried about their
collected web requests revealing any info to OWASP project volunteers.



I think that the OWASP Top Ten can finally get an industry support in the
form of diversified data. I think the way to do this is to solicit requests
and 'sell' participation.  Volunteers from the project and new recruits can
have different tasks of recruiting practitioners, tech companies to support
with data contributions or reviewing the data over a free SaaS based data
analytics engine. If left as a call for data, versus project leaders or new
volunteers from OWASP pursuing active data contributions, we may be looking
at less diversified data points.  I would think this more aggressive model
for data inclusion would actually help to make the project even more
marketable.

don?t want to become public.

Guidance on what data we are looking for:

We are looking for web application vulnerability statistics collected by
your organization:
? In web applications you assessed.
? During the years 2014, 2015, or both.
? These vulnerabilities can be in the code itself, the libraries the
applications use, or in the configuration of the environment the
applications run in.

We are NOT interested in OS, or network level vulnerabilities. We ARE
interested in vulnerabilities in any SQL code running in any databases that
back the applications being assessed and the database accounts used to run
this code, but are generally NOT interested in security issues in the
configuration of the database server itself.

Use your best judgment here to try to keep the data submitted relevant to
the project. If you have a question or aren?t sure, just ask us for
clarification.

There are 5 pages of questions, most of which are very short. The long one
is page 4, which asks for all the vulnerability statistics. If you prefer,
you can send your answers to the questions on page 4 via email to
dave.wichers at owasp.org but please submit the rest of your input via this
Google form.

I've invited you to fill out the form *OWASP Top 10 - 2016 Data Call*. To
fill it out, visit:

Actually,

I'm more interested in prevalence of attack data at the moment, although
I'll take both. I believe vulnerabilities in these areas are rarely looked
for by the defense, but I'm getting the sense that the offense is ignoring
us :-) and going after these types of vulns anyway.
