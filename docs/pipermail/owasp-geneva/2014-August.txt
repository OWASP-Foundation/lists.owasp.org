Hi everyone,
I'd like to invite you to the OWASP Switzerland meeting on August 20th
2014. If you want to attend, please make sure to register for the event
(http://doodle.com/r9yc9k26vkuhp6k4) as the space is *limited* to 30
attendees.

* When:
Wednesday, August 20th 2014
Starting at 18:00
Doors at 17:30

* What (presentation):
"(Client-Side) Flash Security" by Stefan Horlacher
Flash has always been infamous for its security issues. Most of the time
we hear about memory corruption vulnerabilities like buffer overflows
and how clients are attacked. As such attacks are widely known, this
presentation will focus on the less known vulnerabilities that might
arise through the use of Flash. This presentation is going to show
concepts such as client settings, cross-domain policies and how Flash
files may be embedded in your web site in a secure way. Furthermore,
common vulnerabilities found in Flash applications will be presented
(e.g.: Cross-Site Flashing, redirection attacks and others). Some of
these vulnerabilities will be demonstrated in a live demo.

* Where:
Kantonsschule Hohe Promenade
Promenadengasse 11
8001 Z?rich

Exact location is the gallery of the "Mediothek" in the Kantonsschule Hohe
Promenade. It's on the first floor next to the elevator.

* Who:
As usual, all of our meetings are open to everyone and free of charge.

* Agenda
18:00 ? 18:15 | Update on OWASP by Sven Vetsch, OWASP Switzerland
18:20 ? 19:00 | "(Client-Side) Flash Security" by Stefan Horlacher
19:20 - **:** | Dinner

Sven

available in the abstract.

Note
====
  - Only the original authors should submit their research and any
submission from a third party will be rejected.
  - The Abstract should clearly mention the techniques and hacks in detail
and merely mentioning that it works will not help in understanding the
research to its full extent.
  - Be as descriptive as possible in the abstract.
  - Attach your source code/exploit/full paper along with the submission
  - nullcon is an open knowledge/research sharing platform and hence
product/company marketing and pitches will be rejected. We request you not
