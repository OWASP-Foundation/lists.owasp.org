Subject: [OWASP-Geneva] Next OWASP meeting : Sep 11th
Message-ID: <CABaxGnWAb0VKqkbJrCvwCTFD-7SqCEnuPqMX_srdp5DTQZQriA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

The lack of an attack protection mechanism and underprotected APIs might
soon be announced as two newcomers to the 2017 edition of the OWASP "top
10" web application risks.

We will focus the next meetings discussing these topics, starting with a
discussion on the OWASP Core Security Ruleset (CRS) project, a set of rules
built for the open source web application firewall ModSecurity. CRS is
designed to both constitute the 1st. line of defense against web
application attacks like those described in the OWASP Top 10 and to produce
a minimal amount of false alerts.

To better understand this project, we will welcome Christian Folini (Netnea
AG, Bern), a well-known contributer to the CRS project and recognized
speaker about this topic.

The meeting will be held in Geneva (exact location sent by email to
participants) on September 11th and doors will open at 6pm.

Do not forget to register:
