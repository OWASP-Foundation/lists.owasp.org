Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] URGENT - Host Needed: Auckland Meetup, October 9
Message-ID: <CAPWan0QRhROA34q6ixBnm6+zRsSgVPgyhojRN1aS1sS-9zH_ug@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings--

I have been hosting the bi-monthly meetings of the Auckland-area Meetup,
using a conference room at my employer (Orion Health).

Unfortunately, I'll be out of the country on the night of our next meeting
(Tuesday, 9 October), as will my are co-leader, Christian Probst.

I'm looking for a volunteer to host the October 9 meeting, who is able to
provide a meeting space for the group, as well. Our attendance has been
around 20 people, so we don't need a large space.

We have presenter lined up for the October meeting, but still need someone
to lead our Top Ten discussion (in October, we're slated to discuss A4 -
XML External Entities).

Please reply to me ASAP, if you're able to help us out. If I don't have an
alternate host and venue lined up by October 1, I'll have to cancel our
meeting for October.

Thank you--
       John DiLeo
