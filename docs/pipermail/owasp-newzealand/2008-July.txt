Hi everyone,

I am forwarding this email from the OWASP board. It's about OWASP
Certification project. We are currently gathering feedback about how
to design the OWASP certification exam and we need as much feedback as
possible. Please take some of your time to complete the survey. It
shouldn't take more than 5 minutes.

For more information about the OWASP Certification project, please
follow this link:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Certification_Project .

Also, is there anyone who wants to present at the next OWASP meeting
which will be held at the end of August?

Please let me know.

Cheers,

Roberto

I have created a survey to better understand the needs that OWASP
certification can satisfy and need for every chapter leader to not
only take the exam, but to forward it to their respective chapter
mailing lists and other software development and IT security
professionals they know. We would like to close out this survey on the
25th.

Roberto,

Is it possible reschedule the OWASP meetings to either mid month, or
month beginning.
This would stop them from coinciding/clashing with the existing ISIG meetings.

Several people have talked about this and thought it would be a good idea.

Thoughts?

Hi "Mr Smith", ;-)

No problems for moving the OWASP NZ meeting at the begin of September (I was
thinking to have it on the 3rd). When is the next ISIG meeting?

Cheers,

Roberto
