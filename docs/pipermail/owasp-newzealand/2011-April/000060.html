####################
CALL FOR SPONSORS
####################


As mentioned above, OWASP New Zealand Day 2011 will be held in
Auckland on the 7th of July, 2011. OWASP New Zealand Day is a security
conference entirely dedicated to web application security. The
conference is once again being hosted by the University of Auckland
with their support and assistance. OWASP New Zealand Day 2011 is a
free event, but requires sponsor support to help be an instructive and
quality event for the New Zealand community. OWASP is strictly non for
profit. The sponsorship money will be used to help make OWASP New
Zealand Day 2011 a free, compelling and valuable experience for the
audience.


The sponsorship funds collected are to be used for things such as:

* Refreshments (coffee break/lunch) - we want to keep people refreshed
during the day; while we certainly bring good and interesting
speakers, we don't want people to go home when they become hungry.
* Name tags - we feel that getting to know people within the New
Zealand community is important, and name tags make that possible.
* Promotion - up to now our events are propagating by word of mouth.
We would like to get to a wider audience by advertising our events.
* Printed Materials - printed materials will include brochures, tags
and lanyards.


-- Facts --

Last year, the event was supported by 3 sponsors and attracted more
than 150 participants. A lot of good feedback from the audience was
received and this is the reason why we are re-organising the event.

The OWASP New Zealand community is strong and there are more than 160
people currently subscribed to the mailing-list. OWASP New Zealand Day
is expected to attract a number between 150 and 200 attendees during
the conference.

OWASP regular attendees are IT project managers, IT security managers,
IT security consultants, web application architects and developers, QA
managers, QA testers and system administrators.
