<PRE>Hi everyone,


We are happy to announce that training will run alongside OWASP Day
this year, on July 7th 2011. The training venue will be an auditorium
kindly provided by the University of Auckland, in the same building as
the OWASP Day conference itself. Classes will contain up to 20
students, and each seat has a power point for laptop usage.

Two 3-hour slots will be available for training, one from 9am-12noon
and a second from 2pm-5pm. As the slots are quite short, we're looking
for training events that will be providing either introductory lessons
in web app security, or sessions dedicated to a particular topic.

Examples of training topics:

+ Input filtering 101
+ Securing web services
+ Introduction to the OWASP Top 10
+ Hardening web servers
+ Mobile app security
+ Web App Security for Project Managers


If you are interested in running one of the training sessions, please
contact myself or Scott Bell with the following information:

- Trainer name
- Trainer organisation
- Telephone + email contact
- Training title
- Trainer requirements (e.g. a projector)
- Trainee requirements (e.g. laptop, VMWare/Virtualbox etc)
- Training summary (less than 500 words)
- Target audience (e.g. testers, project managers, security managers,
web developers)
- Skill level required (Basic / Intermediate / Advanced)
- A few sentences about why you think this training is important to
web application security
- What attendees can expect to learn (key objectives)
- Short Trainer bio
- List of published papers/presentations
- Course outline E.g.,
	1. Topic 1
		&gt; Sub Topic 1.a
		&gt; Sub Topic 1.b
		&gt; Exercise 1
	2. Topic 2
	3. Topic 3
	&gt; Sub Topic 3.a
	&gt; Demo
	&gt; Sub Topic 3.b



The fixed price per head for training will be $250. As this training
is part of an OWASP event, part of the proceeds go back to OWASP. The
split is as follows:
- 25% to OWASP Global - used for OWASP projects around the world
- 25% to OWASP NZ Day - used for expenses such as catering during the conference
- 50% to the training provider.


If you have any further queries, or wish to submit a training course,
please send the above information to the following email addresses:
- <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">nick.freeman at owasp.org</A>
- <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">scott.bell at owasp.org</A>

Accepted training sessions will be announced on June 15th, together
with the presentations.


Kind Regards,

Nick Freeman &amp; Scott Bell
