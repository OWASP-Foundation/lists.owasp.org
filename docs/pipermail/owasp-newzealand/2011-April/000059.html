<PRE>Hi everyone,

It is with great pleasure that I announce OWASP New Zealand Day's
return in 2011, continuing the tradition started by Roberto in 2009.
The third OWASP New Zealand Day will be happening thanks to the
support provided by the University of Auckland, which will kindly
offer the same conference venue of the last two years. Entry to the
event will, as in the past, be free.

OWASP New Zealand Day 2011 will be held on Thursday July 7th, 2011. If
you wish to attend OWASP New Zealand Day 2011, please register your
attendance:

<A HREF="http://www.regonline.com/owaspnzday2011">http://www.regonline.com/owaspnzday2011</A>

Please remember that registration is mandatory and only available
online. Registration will be closing on the 15th June 2011. For those
of us who like to procrastinate, a reminder will be sent closer to the
time - but it would help planning if you registered sooner rather than
later.

The event web site is available at the following address:

<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2011">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2011</A>

For people who missed out on the first two events, OWASP New Zealand
Day is a single day security conference entirely focused on web
application security. Talks are given both by developers and
penetration testers, giving a rounded view on the threats facing web
applications - and how to mitigate them.
In 2009 &amp; 2010, the event had a panel of 9 speakers and attracted more
than 150 participants from all over New Zealand.

For more information, please visit last year's event conference web site:

<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2010">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2010</A>

In the past, sponsors have offered coffee and lunch to all the
participants. Hopefully, we should be able to do the same this year.
New sponsors are always welcome so if you know of a company or anyone
willing to sponsor, please contact us directly at
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">nick.freeman at owasp.org</A> and <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">scott.bell at owasp.org.</A>

The Call For Papers (CFP) and Call For Sponsors (CFS) will be released
later on today - so if you have something you'd like to present, or
would like to speak but don't know what about, now is the time to
start preparing. More details regarding presentation requirements will
be given in the CFP.

Finally, we would also like to call for volunteers to help during the
event. If you can spare a few hours to help out on the day, please let
either Scott or myself know.


Happy hacking,

Nick Freeman &amp; Scott Bell
OWASP New Zealand Chapter Leaders
