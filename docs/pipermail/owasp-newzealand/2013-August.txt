Hi All,

We have confirmed our sponsors for this year's conference, and our very big
thanks go out to them. These organisations help us keep the conference free
(and you fed and caffeinated!) and without them we would not be able to
make the conference a success.

Our Gold Sponsors are Insomnia Security (http://www.insomniasec.com/) and
Security-Assessment.com (http://www.security-assessment.com/).

And our Silver Sponsors are Orion Health (http://www.orionhealth.com/) and
Qualys (https://www.qualys.com/).

Finally of course, our thanks go to the University of Auckland Business
School who have provided us a fantastic venue for the past five years.


We are also happy to announce that training will run on Wednesday September
11th 2013, the day before the OWASP Day conference. The training venues
will be auditoriums kindly provided by the University of Auckland, in the
same building as the OWASP Day conference itself. Both courses will run
from 9AM to 5PM.

Classes will contain up to 20 students, and each seat has power for laptop
usage. Both courses will be run by Aura Information Security, and there is
both a basic and advanced course available. Feedback from previous training
has been very positive - so get in quick! Brief details are below, for more
information please see the page at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2013#tab=Training

*Basic Web Application Security*

These days websites are under constant attack and it's incredibly easy for
a developer or administrator to make seemingly minor mistakes that
introduce security vulnerabilities.

You can't fight a war that you don't know you're waging. You can't defend
your websites against attack unless you know the tricks the attackers are
using to infiltrate. By the end of this workshop you'll have a good
understanding of the OWASP Top 10.

This is a hands on workshop where attendees must bring their own laptops.
It is required that users are local admins or root on their own machines.

*Advanced Web Application Security*

This advanced web security course is for senior or experienced developers
who are looking for a deeper understanding of web security, beyond the
OWASP Top 10. By the end of this workshop you'll have a good understanding
of advanced attacks as well as advanced design and defense.

This is a hands on workshop where attendees must bring their own laptops.
It is required that users are local admins or root on their own machines.

Registration has now opened, and the registration link can be found from
the OWASP page above.


Last of all, we would like to announce a networking event after the
conference finishes. The venue is TBC but expect a few beers to be had at
one of the locals in the Auckland CBD. Details will be forthcoming in the
next couple of weeks.

For any questions, please don't hesitate to contact myself or Adrian Hayes.


Kind Regards
Nick Freeman & Adrian Hayes
