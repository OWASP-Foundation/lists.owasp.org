Speaker 2: Quintin Russ (SiteHost)
Title: Hardened Hosting
Abstract: Every day web applications are measured and found
vulnerable. Developers and end users get the blame, while the server
is completely ignored and the role it can play in reducing the attack
surface. We will look at what real world bugs can be mitigated today
while maintaining the functionality of today's web applications.
