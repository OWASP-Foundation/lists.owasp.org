<PRE>I'm forwarding this notification to our mailing list, so you're aware of
what's coming.

As you're currently subscribed to our Mailman-managed mailing list, you
will be seeing the three messages to which Matt refers.

The important part: In order to continue receiving messages after 22 March,
you'll need to follow the instructions Matt will be sending, so you're part
of the new Google Groups list when we cut over. This is an OPT-IN process,
so you will not continue to receive messages unless you complete the
required steps.

Thank you--
      John D.

Subject: [mailman-list-owners] Plan of action for retiring mailman

FYI: Full details will always be at
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Staff-Projects/Mailman-EOL">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Staff-Projects/Mailman-EOL</A>

*What's the high level plan/overview?*

   - All inactive/unused lists have been archived and 139 remain on
   lists.owasp.org as of March 1st, 2019
   - For each of those remaining lists, a new Google Group will be created
   with the same ownership as Mailman.  This will be complete by March 8th,
   2019
   - On March 8th, we'll start sending emails to the remaining lists
   letting your members know about the move to Google Groups and providing
   instructions/links to opt into the new mail list on Google Groups.
      - Continue to send messages to lists.owasp.org during the transition
      period
   - We'll repeat that message to your list(s) 3 times ending on March
   22nd, 2019
      - This will be the last day that we cut over to Google Groups.
      Starting March 22nd, send to your new Google Group list to keep
in contact
      with your list's community
   - March 24, 2019 - the Mailman service on lists.owasp.org will be turned
   off
   - March 27, 2019 - the Mailman list archives will be moved to a static
   web host

*What should I tell my list members?*

You're welcome to share this email and the link to the wiki page to give
your list members early warning of the upcoming changes.

*What if I want to move my list sooner or right now?*

Fill out this form &lt;<A HREF="https://goo.gl/forms/e0C1r9SfXizp83AM2">https://goo.gl/forms/e0C1r9SfXizp83AM2</A>&gt; and will
migrate you early.

*What will my new list address be?*

The format we're using for the Google Groups is the following [name]-[type]@
owasp.org so

   - For projects, the Google Group would be like
   <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">testing-guide-project at owasp.org</A>
   - For chapters, the Google Group would be like <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">london-chapter at owasp.org</A>
   - We also expect to have [name]<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">-event at owasp.org</A>, [name]-
   <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">committee at owasp.org</A>, and other types gong forward

*My list is getting SPAM currently, what do I do?*

To be brief, there's going to be some amount of SPAM on the lists until
after the migration - it couldn't be avoided for a whole bunch of reasons.
That said, you've got some choices:

   1. Migrate your list early (see previous question above)
   2. Make some changes to your list configuration to help reduce the SPAM
   traffic.  Bjorn made a post
   &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2019-February/019695.html">https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2019-February/019695.html</A>&gt;
   on the Leaders List  with some advice on setting to help out with this
   including this screenshot
   &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/attachments/20190222/1bbda485/attachment-0004.png">https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/attachments/20190222/1bbda485/attachment-0004.png</A>&gt;.
   I'd recommend the advice on that thread
   &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2019-February/019694.html">http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2019-February/019694.html</A>&gt;
   .
   3. You can always turn on emergency moderation
   &lt;<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-admin/node14.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-admin/node14.html</A>&gt; for your
   list an only let legit posts through during the migration period.

*To sum up:*
If you have questions, please reply to this Google Group (
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">mailman-list-owners at owasp.org</A>) - all correspondence will also be available
via a browser at

Thanks for your patience and understanding as we make this improvement to
our infrastructure.

Cheers!
