Hi all,

Yesterday's meeting was good and thanks again to Adrian Hayes and Kirk
Jackson for their presentations.

For those interested, Kirk's presentation is available online at the
following link:

Yesterday, I also made an announcement regarding the new structure of
the OWASP New Zealand Chapter.

I have resigned from my current position as OWASP New Zealand leader
and announced the new leaders: Nick Freeman and Scott Bell, who are
copied in this email.

Nick Freeman will help with the chapter organisation in Auckland,
while Scott Bell will do the same from Wellington.

I took this decision as I thought it is time for me to leave and let
someone else run the chapter, after four years spent on running it.

It has been a very interesting experience and I learnt a lot on the way.

I am sure Nick and Scott will do a great job so please join me in
congratulating them on their new role.

Regarding myself, I will keep contributing to the chapter as a member.

To summarise the activities during my leaderships, below is a short
description of what was done since May 2007:

- Founded the OWASP New Zealand chapter;
- Organised 10 meetings with 18 presentations (7 of which I presented);
- Organised 2 free OWASP Day conferences (2009 and 2010) with an
average of 150 participants and 7 presentations;
- Increased number of OWASP NZ Mailing-list members to 161 members;
- Contributed to the OWASP Education project and OWASP Testing Guide.

For more information, please visit the OWASP NZ Chapter page, which
has been updated to reflect the new changes:

Thanks again to everyone who helped the chapter during these years.

It has been great to see the chapter growing so quickly.

Cheers,

Roberto Suggi Liverani
