Just wondering what the status of things is for OWASP New Zealand. I see there was some planned press, but maybe I missed it?
 
I know a number of people that are interested in what is happening, and there are a lot of people involved in web app security on the ISIG mailing list that would be interested as well (www.isig.org.nz). 
 
Thanks

Darren,

Thanks for your enquiry. We are happy to announce that everything is now on
track after some initials delays. A date and venue for May are in place and
communication for the event are due to commence within the next 10 days.
We will advise people on this mailing-list, the ISIG mailing list and update
the wiki page so that there is no risk of anyone missing the communications.

Cheers,

Roberto
