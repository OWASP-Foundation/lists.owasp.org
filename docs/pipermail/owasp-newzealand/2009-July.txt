Hi everyone,

OWASP NZ Day 2009 has been great!

We had more than 150 attendees from all over the country, an iPod draw
and seven presentations covering a wide range of web application
security topics.
Audience raised a good number of questions and eventually provided
very positive feedback. As a result, the OWASP NZ mailing-list has now
98 members. Not bad for the first OWASP Day in New Zealand! ;-)

I would like to remember that entry to the conference was free and
sponsors also offered coffee, lunch and snack breaks to most of the
attendees.

The presentations have been published and can be downloaded from:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2009#tab=Presentations

Some pictures of the conference have been uploaded to the site. Audio
recordings will be published soon.

OWASP Day had also some blogs/media coverage:

- Kirk Jackson wrote an excellent article covering all the key points
raised during the conference:
http://pageofwords.com/blog/CategoryView,category,OWASP.aspx

- NetGuide (August) included a couple of articles referring to two of
the presentations given at the OWASP Day

Again, big thanks to the sponsors (Security-Assessment.com, Lateral
Security and University of Auckland), the speakers and the conference
committee for their great contribution to this conference.

Cheers,

Roberto Suggi Liverani
OWASP NZ Leader
