 Agile Security Training Announcement
Message-ID: <54C5AA3E.3010407@owasp.org>

Hi Everyone,


We're proud to announce the full day training session to take place on the 26th of February, the day before the main conference. The training is to be provided by Laura Bell from SafeStack and is looking pretty awesome. Please see the conference website for registration details: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2015


Training Outline

Agile development is often seen as a delicate balance of ritual and roles allowing for rapid development, continuous deployment and the expansion of the post-it note industry. Security is often seen as a lumbering giant of process, governance and technology allowing for increased control, reduced risk and the expansion of the technology vendor industry.

What if you could merge the two?

The world of security is changing to meet the needs of agile software development. Organisations around the world are coming up with tools, techniques and processes to make security a continuous presence to support developers. This hands on, fast-paced course will not only give students a solid grounding in how to bring security into agile software development life-cycles, but also give a range of tools, techniques and practical skills to make it happen.

Laura Bell is the founder and lead consultant at SafeStack, a specialist New Zealand agile security firm. With almost a decade of experience in software development and information security, Laura specialises in bringing security practices and culture into organisations of every shape and size. Her recent research into agile security practices has
generated a set of tools and processes that can enable the management of security risk without compromising innovation or speed.

This full day training will cost $380 USD per person (roughly $500 NZD) and will be held at the The University of Auckland Engineering Department.



We'd also like to mention our fantastic sponsors, because there's no conference without them: Insomnia Security, Aura Information Security, Security-Assessment.com, Beca, Wynyard, and BinaryMist.

Cheers,
OWASP New Zealand
