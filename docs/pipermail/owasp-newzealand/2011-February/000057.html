<PRE>Hi all,

This is a reminder for the OWASP NZ Meeting - Wed 2nd March 2011,
6.00pm @ Auckland: Level 1, Building 2, 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell -
Wellington: Datacraft House Level 1, 99-105 Customhouse Quay
Wellington 6011. Please RSVP as we are organising catering based on
the number of attendees.

Kirk Jackson will also join us with a presentation on &quot;I know what you
did last summer: The latest from the world of web hacks&quot;. I am sure it
is going to be an interesting night.

More details below:

Abstract:

While we were on holiday, facebook accounts got hijacked, conferences
happened and javascript ran without permission.

In this short talk, Kirk will cover some of the latest hacks and how
they worked.

Bio:

Kirk Jackson is a Security Consultant who has recently joined Aura
Software Security after previously working for Xero.

Kirk has been awarded a Microsoft Developer Security MVP, and for the
past seven years has organised the Wellington .NET Users Group, and
presented at TechEd, OWASP and other conferences.
