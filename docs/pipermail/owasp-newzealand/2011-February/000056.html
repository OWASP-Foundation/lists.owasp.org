<PRE>Hi all,

The OWASP New Zealand chapter is organising the next chapter meeting
for the 2nd of March 2011.

An important announcement regarding the structure and future of the
chapter will be made during the meeting.

Adrian Hayes from Security-Assessment.com will talk
about: &quot;Crazy Insecure Web Apps Google Didn't Tell You About&quot;

_Abstract_
There is no such thing as a completely secure web application, but
completely insecure web applications are more common than you might
think. Join us on a tour of some of the worlds most insecure web apps
where passwords are frowned upon and unauthenticated arbitrary file
uploads are welcomed with open arms. This presentation will highlight
some of the security blunders people make every day when deploying their
web applications. I mean, why not set your web root to C:\?

_Bio_
Adrian Hayes is a security consultant for Security-Assessment.com in
Wellington. Adrian comes from a web app development background but has
now jumped the fence and spends his time hacking them.


There is still an open slot for presentation, so if you want to
present, or start
a discussion about web app sec topics, please drop me an email
at robertosl (at) owasp.org .

Food and drinks will be provided as usual. Please confirm your
attendance so we can
arrange food/drinks according to number of attendees. Again, this is a
no-profit event,
so entry, food/drinks are provided for free by the sponsor.
