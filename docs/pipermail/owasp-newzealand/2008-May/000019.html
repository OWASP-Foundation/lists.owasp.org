<PRE>Hi everyone,

Good news for OWASP NZ! Other people are starting to present!! :-) That's a
very good result and if there are other people who feel to talk about web
app security at the next meetings, please don't be afraid and let me know.

Okay... the next meeting will have Dean Jerkovich, Security Analyst from
ASB, presenting on &quot;Fuzz the Web&quot; and Paul Craig, Principal Security
Consultant from Security-Assessment.com, on &quot;Hacking The World With Flash
Part #2: The Results&quot;.
I am sure it is going to be an exciting evening...

We should also receive some OWASP materials (books, t-shirts, cds, etc) and
I hope to have them before the meeting.

Please also note that the OWASP NZ web page has been re-designed (
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/New_Zealand">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/New_Zealand</A> ) (credits to Mark Piper). Let us
know what you think :-) .

and drinks will be provided as usual. Teleconference between Auckland and
Wellington will be setup as previously. Auckland people please confirm
attendance to myself or to Rob Munro. Wellington people please confirm
attendance to Mark Piper. (Contact details at the bottom)
