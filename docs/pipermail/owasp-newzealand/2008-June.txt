Hi everyone,

Good news for OWASP NZ! Other people are starting to present!! :-)
That's a very good result and if there are other people who feel to
talk about web app security at the next meetings, please don't be
afraid and let me know.

Okay... the next meeting will have Dean Jerkovich, Security Analyst
from ASB, presenting on "Fuzz the Web" and Paul Craig, Principal
Security Consultant from Security-Assessment.com, on "Hacking The
World With Flash Part #2: The Results".
I am sure it is going to be an exciting evening...

We should also receive some OWASP materials (books, t-shirts, cds,
etc) and I hope to have them before the meeting.

Please also note that the OWASP NZ web page has been re-designed (

Let us know what you think :-) .

Date for the next OWASP NZ meeting is the 25th June at 6.30 pm. Food
and drinks will be provided as usual. Teleconference between Auckland
and Wellington will be setup as previously. Auckland people please
confirm attendance to myself or to Rob Munro. Wellington people please
confirm attendance to Mark Piper. (Contact details at the bottom)
