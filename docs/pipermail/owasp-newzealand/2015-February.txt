Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] Auckland ISIG Thursday February 26th - Empire
	Tavern
Message-ID: <CAMRtL25_ZOSbU3ZrKS8wFuqqyRVXoS5qwhnhqxXRPCcBo_Qc8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

As ISIG this month falls on the night before OWASP day, I've discussed with
the ISIG folks and we'd like to propose a gathering of both ISIG and OWASP
in the main bar at the Empire Tavern tomorrow night. No formal talk is
planned, but the usual ISIG tradition of a post-pub steak will most likely
be observed.

The Information Security Interest Group is a professional interest group
run for folks involved in information security, with informal meetings on
the last Thursday of every month.

Cheers!
-Denis
OWASP NZ
