<PRE>Hi everyone,


With OWASP NZ Day 2011 less than 3 weeks away, now is the time to
register if you haven't already. The registration deadline has been
pushed back to June 23rd (that's COB next Thursday) so if your
colleagues, clients and/or friends are forgetful or always busy, now
would be the ideal time to remind them. Register here:
<A HREF="http://www.regonline.com/owaspnzday2011">http://www.regonline.com/owaspnzday2011</A> for OWASP NZ Day 2011 on July
7th.

We have just announced the selected speakers, trainers, and the
schedule. A concise list of speakers can be found below:

Secure Development: What The OWASP Guide Didn't Tell You - Blair
Strang, Security-Assessment.com
I &lt;3 Reporting - Managing Effective Web Application Assessments -
Andrew Evans, Kiwibank
Testing Mobile Applications - Nick von Dadelszen, Lateral Security
Web Crypto for the Developer Who Has Better Things to Do - Adrian
Hayes, Security-Assessment.com
Concurrency Vulnerabilities - Brett Moore, Insomnia Security
A Day in the Life of a WAF - Sam Pickles, F5
HTML5 Security - Mike Haworth &amp; Kirk Jackson, Aura Information Security
File Uploads are Evil - Kirk Jackson, Aura Information Security
Sleeping Easy: Architecting Web Applications Securely - Mark Young, Datacom
Real Applications, Real Vulnerabilities, Really Exploited - Quintin
Russ, SiteHost


In addition to the speakers, we will also have two 3-hour training
sessions running at the same time as the conference - one in the
morning and one in the afternoon. Seats for training are strictly
limited - so book soon! The two courses are:
- Codefather (9am-12pm) - Run by Aura Information Security
- Secure Development 101 (2pm-5pm) - Run by Security-Assessment.com

Much more information about the speakers, trainers, and of course the
shedule can be perused on the OWASP NZ Day 2011 website:
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2011">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2011</A>


We would again like to thank our sponsors for the event;
Security-Assessment.com, Lateral Security and F5, as well as the
University of Auckland which has very kindly provided us a venue for
the third year in a row.


If you have any questions regarding the conference, please email
myself (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">nick.freeman at owasp.org</A>) or Scott (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">scott.bell at owasp.org</A>).


See you on the 7th!
