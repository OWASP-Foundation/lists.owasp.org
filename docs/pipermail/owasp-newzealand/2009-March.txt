Hi everyone,

I am glad to officially announce that the OWASP New Zealand Day will
be held the 13th July 2009 in Auckland. The conference venue will be
kindly provided by the University of Auckland. A wiki site has been
created and includes all the event details. The event web page is
available at the following address:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2009

For people who missed my previous posts, this is the first *free* all
day security conference in New Zealand entirely dedicated to web
application security.

If you wish to attend, please register by clicking on the
"Registration" button on the event web page (above URL). Please
remember that registration is mandatory and only available online.
Registration will be closing on the 20th June 2009. I will be sending
a couple of reminders before the registration closing date.

Please invite as many people you think are interested. Many resources
are involved to organise this event and if a good number
of people attends, I am sure I won't have any issues to re-organise it
next year! ;-)

Feel free to have a link from your organisation/site to the event
page. If you want, you can use the banner available from the event
page.
Feel also free to use your email signature and have a link.

Depending on the number of sponsors and budget available, free coffee
and lunch for the attendees might be provided as well.
If you know a company or anyone willing to sponsor, please contact me
directly. I will soon publish a Call For Sponsor (CFS) including more
details.

I will also publish CFP (Call For Paper), so if you wish to talk or
you know someone who does, then you are more than welcome to contact
me.

If there is anyone who has contacts with media, please let me know as
Rob and myself will be promoting the event from now on.

Last but not least, if anyone feels to help/volunteer during the
event, please drop me an email.

Again thanks very much for your attention,

Roberto Suggi Liverani
OWASP NZ Leader

OWASP Day New Zealand 2009

CALL FOR SPONSOR

Proposal

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Day New Zealand Call for
Sponsor (CFS) is out!

The OWASP day New Zealand is the first all day security conference
entirely dedicated to web application security in New Zealand.
The event is free, and is in line with the OWASP open source and not
for profit model.

The OWASP New Zealand Day 2009 will be held on 13th July 2009. The
conference venue will be provided by the University of Auckland. The
OWASP Day Auckland 2009 will be a free for entry event. Sponsors are
invited to help the OWASP New Zealand Day to be a free, instructive
and quality event for the New Zealand internet community.

The sponsorship funds collected will be used for things such as:

- Lecture videos ? the filmed presentations can be shared online and
made available also to people who cannot make it to the conference.
- Refreshments - we want to keep people at the event for an extended
period, and we certainly bring in a variety of speakers keeping the
event interesting and informative, therefore we don't want people to
go home when they become hungry.
- Name tags ? a lot of social networking is done at these events so we
feel that getting to know each other is important and name tags make
this easier.
- Promotion - Until now our events have been propagated by word of
mouth. We would like to reach a wider audience by advertising the
OWASP events.
- Printed Materials - We would like to start handing out printed
material at our conferences.
- International Speaker(s) - With sufficient funds we aim to be able
to invite quality international speakers who add real value to the
OWASP event.

Facts

The OWASP NZ community is strong and there are 78 people currently
subscribed to the mailing-list.
We have an average of 50 people attending in Auckland and 10/15 people
in Wellington at our regular meetings. This event is expected to
attract at least 100 attendees for the conference which will be hosted
by the University of Auckland.
OWASP regular attendees are IT project managers, IT security managers,
IT security consultants, web application architect and developers, QA
managers, QA testers, system administrators and students.
The OWASP NZ chapter meetings have received some excellent feedback
and a lot of work has been done over the last year making improvements
as can be seen at:

Regarding Auckland, please confirm your registration. Later today, I

Happy New Year everyone!

2008 has been a very productive year for OWASP NZ and our OWASP NZ web
page just speaks for itself
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/New_Zealand) with a total of ten
presentations and five meetings. The OWASP Board is really happy with
the good work done.

The number of attendees increased considerably reaching the number of
50 people in the last meeting. Undoubtly, this is a sign of positive
feedback from the NZ IT security community. Again, I really thank
everyone and especially the speakers, the sponsors, the attendees and
all the people who proactively helped myself and Rob Munro to organise
the meetings.

Considering the successful results in 2008, I thought that it will be
great to have an OWASP Day conference this year! The first OWASP Day
in NZ!

OWASP Day is an all-day security conference event dedicated entirely
to web application security. At this stage, myself and Rob are
planning the venue and the date most probably is the 13th July 2009.
The event will be held in Auckland. At the end of the next week, I
should be able to give an update including more details. A CFP (Call
for Paper) and CFS (Call For Sponsor) will also be published soon if
everything goes well and we will then focus on the promotion of the
event.

Before the OWASP Day, we are going to have a chapter meeting on the
19th of March (Thursday). In Auckland, we will be kindly sponsored by
Vodafone New Zealand and Security-Assessment.com. Again, thanks very
much to Andrew Davey for supporting OWASP. Security-Assessment.com
will also be sponsoring the event in Wellington.

The meeting will be held at 6.30 pm. An audio-conference will be setup
between Auckland and Wellington as the previous time.

Auckland people: please note that PRE-REGISTRATION is mandatory.
Please send an email to robertosl (at) owasp.org with your first name
and last name. **People who fails to pre-register will not be granted
access to the Vodafone building**.

Wellington people: location remains the same as the previous one and
please reserve your attendance to Blair Strang ( 021 229 7231 ).

Speakers will be Paul Craig and Muhaimin Dzulfakar from Security-Assessment.com.

Paul will be speaking about ActiveX Exploitation in 2009. The talk
will cover the who, how, what, where, when, wtf? of ActiveX technology
and ActiveX Exploitation in 2009.

Muhaimin (Emmy) will talk about his new *beta* SQL injection tool
"Mysqloit". Mysqloit exploits SQL injection flaws to get remote shell
on systems running Mysql database server. Demo will also be included.

Regarding the next OWASP meeting, food and drinks will be provided as usual.

Meeting co-sponsor: Vodafone New Zealand/Security-Assessment.com
(Auckland) and Security-Assessment.com (Wellington)
