Hi everyone,

The OWASP New Zealand Day 2010 conference was great and it was cool to
see 160 delegates gathering for the event! At the end, we had 7
presentations including an impromptu one ;-).

Feedback forms returned indicate audience was satisfied with the
overall quality of the event and I believe this feedback recognised
all the efforts to make this conference happen. In fact, I must thank
again all the speakers for the time spent and their contribution to
the OWASP community. Without them, there won't be a conference.

I would also like to remember that entry to the conference was free
and sponsors Security-Assessment.com and Lateral Security offered
coffee, lunch and snack breaks to all the attendees.

Some of the presentations have been published and can be downloaded from:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2010#tab=Presentations

Remaining presentations will be probably published later next month.

OWASP NZ Day 2010 had also some blog coverage:

- Kirk Jackson wrote an excellent article covering all the key points
raised during the conference:

If anyone is planning to write or wrote articles/stories on the
conference/talks, please let me know.
