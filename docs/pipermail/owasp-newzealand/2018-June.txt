Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] Elevation of Privilege Card Game - Limited
	Local Print Run
Message-ID: <CAPWan0RKd0fz0ORr-2hhyDSjVLo34qf2QLFd7xkjef3mQAgDuA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, All--

My apologies if you've received this through multiple channels - I'm trying
to get the word out as widely as I can.

I'm interested in having a few copies of the *Elevation of Privilege* threat
modelling card game, for my use in training developers to do threat
modelling on their applications.

If you're not familiar with *EoP*, the game was developed by Adam Shostack
at Microsoft, and its use is described in his book *Threat Modeling:
Designing for Security *(2014). Microsoft had a quantity of the card decks
produced, and they were a frequent give-away item at conferences for a
while.

Although the decks are out of print from Microsoft, they made all of the
card images, score sheets, etc., publicly available under the Creative
Commons license (see https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?i
d=20303 for downloads and further information).

To get a few professional-quality decks for my own use, I'm planning to
have a local printer in Auckland do a print run from the InDesign files
provided by Microsoft. It's an 84-card "tarot"-size deck (70mm x 120mm),
printed in colour on both sides. There's a fixed cost to set up the print
run, so I can reduce the cost per deck by ordering more decks. If I order a
total of 20 decks, the cost per deck will be $11.70; the cost will go down
further for higher quantities.

If you're interested in getting some decks, please contact me directly (
john.dileo at owasp.org). After the final price is set, I'll need to get
pre-payment for the printing, and can ship them for actual postage cost, or
arrange pickup in central Auckland.

Full Disclosure: I found out last week that Adam is working with OWASP
staff to do a new print run (which will probably include the box), with
sales benefitting the OWASP Foundation. I'm proceeding with a local print
run (at cost), because there's still no solid date for getting them into
the OWASP Store.

Thanks--
