Hi all,

I am forwarding an email from Kirk Jackson about the upcoming Code
Camp conference in Auckland. It is free and they also have a security
workshop on Threat Modelling and SDL. The event will be held the 13th
September.

Here is the email:

Hi,

I'm organising a free Code Camp on 13 Sept, and we've managed to get
Michael Howard to run a 3 hour workshop in the morning:
http://www.codecamp.net.nz

It's free to attend, so if you (or your clients) want some free
training with Michael, we'd be happy to have you along! Please sign up
soon, because we'll be figuring out which room to use soon.

Cheers,

Kirk
