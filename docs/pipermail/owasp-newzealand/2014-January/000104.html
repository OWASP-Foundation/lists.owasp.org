<PRE>Just a small update.

Auckland class is almost full; a few seats are available in Wellington
class. Fore more details and registration please visit:
<A HREF="https://www.insomniasec.com/secure-training">https://www.insomniasec.com/secure-training</A>

Some Highlights from the course:
----
* Covers latest industry standards such as OWASP Top 10 (2013)
* Insight into latest security vulnerabilities (such as mass assignment bug
in MVC Frameworks)
* Thorough guidance on security best practices (like HTTP header such as
CSP, HSTS header etc).
* References to real world analogy for each vulnerability
* Hands-on labs
* Taught by the Industry's leading expert and Black Hat Trainer.
----

Even if you are not attending the training but going to be around, come and
have a few beers. I will be handing out some discount vouchers for the SQLi
Lab.

Cheers
Sid
