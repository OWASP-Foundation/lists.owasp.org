<PRE>Hi everyone,

Today we are proud to announce the fourth annual OWASP New Zealand Day
conference, to be held at the University of Auckland on Friday August
31st, 2012. OWASP New Zealand Day is a one-day conference dedicated to
web application security, with an emphasis on secure development
techniques to help Kiwi developers build more secure applications.

Based on feedback from last year, the structure of the conference will
be slightly different this time.

* We will be offering training on the day before the conference
(Thursday August 30th) rather than at the same time as the conference.
* After lunch on the conference day, we will split to two tracks - one
focused on deep technical topics, the other on policy, compliance and
risk management.

The Call For Papers, Trainers and Sponsors is now open, the details of
which can be found below - as well as details for registration!



###
REGISTRATION AND VENUE
###

As with last year, registration will be performed through the
RegOnline system. Registrations will be limited to 300 people, so

CALL FOR PAPERS
###

OWASP New Zealand Day conferences attract a high quality of speakers
from a variety of security discliplines including web developers,
system administrators, penetration testers, policy specialists and
more. There tends to be a bias towards talks aimed at developers in an
effort to provide as much assistance to Kiwi development houses,
however this year the conference will consist of three tracks covering
both technical and risk management topics. We are looking for
presentations on a wide variety of web application security topics,
including but not limited to:

* OWASP Project Presentation (i.e Tool Updates/Project Status etc)
* Threat modelling of web applications
* Privacy Concerns with Applications and Data Storage
* Vulnerability analysis of web applications (code review, pentest,
static analysis, scanning)
* Baseline or Metrics for Application Security
* Countermeasures for web application vulnerabilities - secure coding practices
* Web application security
* Platform or language (e.g. Java, .NET) security features that help
secure web applications
* Secure application development
* How to use databases securely in web applications
* Security of Service Oriented Architectures
* Access control in web applications
* Web services security
* Browser security
* PCI
* Risk management
* Security concepts for C*Os, project managers and other non-technical attendees

The timeline for submissions is as follows:

15th Jul 2012: The official closing date for receiving a synopsis of
the presentation.
31st Jul 2012: Announcements on selected candidates will be provided.
20th Aug 2012: Complete presentations will need to be submitted.

The email subject must be &quot;OWASP New Zealand 2012: CFP&quot; and the email
body must contains the following information/sections:

* Name and Surname

* List of the author's previous papers/articles/speeches on the same topic

* Abstract (up to 500 words)
* Why the contribution is relevant for OWASP New Zealand 2012
* If you are not from New Zealand, will your company support your
travel/accomodation costs - Yes/No

The submission will be reviewed by the OWASP New Zealand Day CFP
Review Board and the highest voted talks will be selected and invited
for presentation.

PLEASE NOTE:
** Due to limited budget available, expenses for international
speakers cannot be covered.

the company will become &quot;Support Sponsor&quot; of the event.

Please submit your presentation topics and an abstract of up to 500
words to Nick Freeman and Adrian Hayes - <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">nick.freeman at owasp.org</A> &amp;

###
CALL FOR SPONSORS
###


As mentioned above, OWASP New Zealand Day 2012 will be held in
Auckland on the 31st of August, 2012. OWASP New Zealand Day is a
security conference entirely dedicated to web application security.
The conference is once again being hosted by the University of
Auckland with their support and assistance. OWASP New Zealand Day 2012
is a free event, but requires sponsor support to help be an
instructive and quality event for the New Zealand community. OWASP is
strictly non for profit. The sponsorship money will be used to help
make OWASP New Zealand Day 2012 a free, compelling and valuable
experience for the audience.


The sponsorship funds collected are to be used for things such as:

* Refreshments (coffee break/lunch) - we want to keep people refreshed
during the day; while we certainly bring good and interesting
speakers, we don't want people to go home when they become hungry.
* Name tags - we feel that getting to know people within the New
Zealand community is important, and name tags make that possible.
* Promotion - up to now our events are propagating by word of mouth.
We would like to get to a wider audience by advertising our events.
* Printed Materials - printed materials will include brochures, tags
and lanyards.


-- Facts --

Last year, the event was supported by 5 sponsors and attracted more
than 200 participants. Plenty of constructive (and positive!) feedback
from the audience was received and we are using this to make the
conference more appealing to more people. For more information on last
year's event, please visit:
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2011">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2011</A>

The OWASP New Zealand community is strong and there are more than 220
people currently subscribed to the mailing-list. OWASP New Zealand Day
is expected to attract between 200 and 250 attendees this year.

OWASP regular attendees are IT project managers, IT security managers,
IT security consultants, web application architects and developers, QA
managers, QA testers and system administrators.
