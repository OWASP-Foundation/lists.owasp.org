Hi everyone,


With OWASP NZ Day 2011 less than 3 weeks away, now is the time to
register if you haven't already. The registration deadline has been
pushed back to June 23rd (that's COB next Thursday) so if your
colleagues, clients and/or friends are forgetful or always busy, now
would be the ideal time to remind them. Register here:
http://www.regonline.com/owaspnzday2011 for OWASP NZ Day 2011 on July
7th.

We have just announced the selected speakers, trainers, and the
schedule. A concise list of speakers can be found below:

University of Auckland which has very kindly provided us a venue for
the third year in a row.

Message-ID: <BANLkTin6m14mS=nB9DX7GHgA1Sh+mABAEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Aura Information Security and Security-Assessment.com have graciously
offered to forfeit their share of the training fee in order to lower
the cost of the training sessions at OWASP NZ Day 2011. Both
organisations believe in the importance of training developers in New
Zealand, and have sacrificed almost all cost recovery of the training
sessions to make them more accessible to you, the OWASP NZ Day 2011
attendees.

This halves the cost of training at the conference, bringing it down
to just NZD$125 per person for an excellent and informative 3 hour
training session. For more information about the available training
sessions, please see the OWASP NZ Day 2011 website at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2011#tab=Training_.28NEW.21.29

All trainees who have already registered will be refunded NZD$125 to
match the new cost of training.

Seats are limited to 20 per training session - so register soon! You
can sign up at the following URL:
https://www.regonline.com/owaspnzday2011

The registration cut-off for training has been extended to COB Jun 30
- that's next Thursday. Standard attendee registration will close at
COB today.

Please direct any queries to nick.freeman at owasp.org and scott.bell at owasp.org.


Kind Regards


Nick Freeman & Scott Bell
