<PRE>Hi everyone,

As mentioned during the last OWASP New Zealand Chapter meeting, it was
our intention to re-organise the OWASP New Zealand day event this
year, considering the success of the previous edition.

Today, I am glad to announce that the second OWASP New Zealand Day
2010 will be happening thanks to the support provided by the
University of Auckland, which will kindly offer the same conference
venue of last year. Entry to the event will be free.

The conference date has been set for the 15th of July 2010 (Auckland).

If you wish to attend OWASP New Zealand 2010, please register your attendance:

<A HREF="http://owaspnzday2010.eventbrite.com/">http://owaspnzday2010.eventbrite.com/</A>

Please remember that registration is mandatory and only available
online. Registration will be closing on the 20th June 2010.

The event web site is available at the following address:

<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2010">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2010</A>

For people who missed the first event, OWASP New Zealand Day is a
single day security conference entirely focused on web application
security. In 2009, the event had a panel of 9 speakers and attracted
more than 150 participants from all over New Zealand.

For more information, please visit last year's event conference web site:

<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2009">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2009</A>

In 2009, sponsors offered coffee and lunch to all the participants.
Hopefully, we should be able to do the same this year. However new
sponsors are always welcome so if you know of a company or anyone
willing to sponsor, please contact me directly at: robertosl AT
owasp.org.

I will publish a CFP (Call For Papers) soon so if you would like to
present a paper or you know someone who does, then please contact me.

Also, if there is anyone who has contacts with media, please let me
know as Rob and myself will be promoting the event from now on.

Last but not least, if anyone would like to volunteer to help during
the event please drop me an email.

Last year, we had volunteers helping during the whole day and that was
really appreciated.

Again thanks very much for your attention,

Roberto Suggi Liverani
OWASP New Zealand Chapter Leader
