Hi all,

Thanks for coming yesterday evening. It has been a good security session.
Really happy to see new faces :) and, guys, thanks for the drinks ;)

I have uploaded the presentation to the OWASP web site and it is available
here:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:Xpath_Injection.ppt

For those of you who want to play a little bit more with Xpath, here are
some tools you can try:

If you want to talk about a specific subject at the next OWASP meeting,
let's discuss it here.

Next meeting is going to be probably on April. For those who wanted to
contact me, just write me at this email address and I will be happy to
respond.

Thanks again,

Roberto
