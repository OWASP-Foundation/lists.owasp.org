Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] OWASP NZ Day 2015 - Call for Presentations,
	Training, and Sponsors
Message-ID: <546D378E.6010403@owasp.org>

Hi Everyone,


Today we are proud to announce the sixth OWASP New Zealand Day
conference, to be held at the University of Auckland on Friday February
27th, 2015. The call for presenters, trainers, and sponsors is now open.
We will open registration for general attendees in the coming weeks, so
stay tuned as registrations will be limited.

OWASP New Zealand Day is a free, one-day conference dedicated to web
application security with an emphasis on secure development techniques
and management to help Kiwis build more secure applications.

Similarly to last year:

* We will be offering training on the day before the conference
(Thursday Feb 26th) similar to previous years.
* After lunch on the conference day, we hope to split into two tracks -
one focused on deep technical topics, the other on policy, compliance
and risk management.


We have a large amount of presenter slots that we need to fill, on
everything from deeply technical topics to risk and compliance.
Presentation submissions are welcome from all interested parties, we're
especially interested in hearing from the developer and other technical
communities, not just security professionals. Keep in mind we will not
consider vendor pitches or commercial content. More information is
available here:

We also have a number of training slots we'd like to fill. If you have a
security related training you'd like to give the day before the main
conference, please make a submission. More information is available
here:

OWASP is strictly not for profit and to keep our conference free we need
sponsors to support us. The sponsorship money is used to help make OWASP
New Zealand Day 2015 a free, compelling, and valuable experience for the
audience. More information about sponsorship is available here:
