<PRE>Hi everyone,

Yesterday we had the 1st OWASP NZ meeting and it was enjoyable and an
interesting session. Our big thanks to the people who joined us although some
struggled to find the place. We fear other people may have attempted and
failed to find the location so we are really sorry for any inconvenience
caused.

For all future meetings more detailed directions will be provided.

For the people interested in getting a soft copy of the presentation delivered
yesterday, please send me an email.

Presentation main topics were:

* OWASP introduction
* NZ OWASP Strategy expanded
* Overview of the Top 10 web application vulnerabilities

Please feel free to come back with any feedback and/or questions.

With regard to the next meeting:

We are currently discussing whether to have monthly or bimonthly meetings. We
can carry on this discussion through this mailing-list.

We are also discussing how to get other people involved. It would be nice to
have  a variety of people  delivering  presentations and/or sharing their
experiences  in the web security field as well.

We will put more effort into contacting universities and government
institutions . If any of you know people who might be interested, please
invite them on to this mailing list.

Regarding sponsorship:

Companies who would like to sponsor the event are welcome to contact us. This
is a not for profit event and sponsorship is pretty inexpensive

and used merely to cover costs, mostly  in the area of venues and
refreshments.

Thanks,

Roberto / Antonio

</PRE>
