Greetings--

I'm happy to announce the Call for Presentations and Call for Trainers are
now open for the upcoming OWASP New Zealand Day. Up-to-date information can
always be found on the event's Web page -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2019.

The event will be held on Thursday and Friday, February 21 and 22. The main
conference is a two-track, one-day event on Friday; training will be held
on the preceding day (Thursday).

We will once again be hosted by the University of Auckland Business School.

For those interested in sponsoring the event, details on sponsorship levels
will be available soon. Please feel free to contact me if you're interested
in getting in early on sponsorship.
