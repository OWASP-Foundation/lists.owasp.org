Hi Folks,

We're having a RoR-focussed OWASP meetup in Wellington next Monday, and it
would be great if you could come -- and spread the word to your friends and
colleagues!

http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-New-Zealand-Chapter-Wellington/events/233954065/

If you're a Ruby on Rails developer, and want to learn more about security,
then this is the talk for you.

Technology-willing, the session will be livestreamed and recorded, and
available at this url from 6pm:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hez1QYc9yo8

*Date:* Monday 10 October

*Time: *5:45pm for a 6pm start

*Title: *Introduction to Ruby on Rails security

*Audience:* Rails developers, or those willing to learn

*Location:* Snapper, Level 11, Kordia House, 109-125 Willis Street,
Wellington

*Synopsis:*

Tim Goddard is a security consultant and trainer at Aura Information
Security. This session will be an introduction to web security concepts as
applied to the popular web framework Ruby on Rails.

This session is suitable for beginners who haven't learnt much about web
security, but know a bit about Ruby on Rails, and who want to make sure
that their applications are secure against common web attacks such as the
OWASP Top Ten.

Rails has built-in protections for some web attacks, but others require
configuration or custom code. Tim will cover these, and edge cases that
might trip you up.

*Signup:*
