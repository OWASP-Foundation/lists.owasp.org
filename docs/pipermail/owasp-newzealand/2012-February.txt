Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] Notice:  Disregard Spam Message
Message-ID: <4F432BBF.1010109@owasp.org>

Hi all,

As you may have seen, there was a spam message sent to the OWASP New
Zealand mailing list impersonating the list address
(owasp-newzealand at lists.owasp.org).

The subject of this message is ?owasp-newzealand at lists.owasp.org Nacha
Alert ID07340?. Please disregard this message and do not click on the
links.

We have identified the cause of this and notified OWASP about the
configuration issue with Mailman and hope to get this resolved ASAP.


Our Apologies,

Scott Bell & Nick Freeman
