<PRE>Hi all,

Following on from OWASP New Zealand Day in July, the next OWASP New
Zealand chapter meeting will be held on Tuesday September 20, 2011
held in both Auckland and Wellington via video conference. The meeting
will start at 6.30pm this time - a little bit later than previous
meetings, as a number of attendees (and speakers..) have had trouble
reaching the venues due to traffic at this hour.

Speakers
---
We are looking for talks for the meeting, so if anyone is interested
in speaking at the next meeting, please send an email through to
myself and Scott Bell (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">scott.bell at owasp.org</A>). Talks can be any length,
and we welcome new speakers and talks aimed at those new to OWASP and
web application security. Please let us know by the end of next week
(Friday September 2nd) so we can put together an agenda.

Wellington, please respond to this email so we can get an idea of
