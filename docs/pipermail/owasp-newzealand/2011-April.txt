Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] Announcement: OWASP New Zealand Day 2011
Message-ID: <BANLkTimYsWwoSAXuOwdbsTcFJ+pnx3ChZg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

It is with great pleasure that I announce OWASP New Zealand Day's
return in 2011, continuing the tradition started by Roberto in 2009.
The third OWASP New Zealand Day will be happening thanks to the
support provided by the University of Auckland, which will kindly
offer the same conference venue of the last two years. Entry to the
event will, as in the past, be free.

OWASP New Zealand Day 2011 will be held on Thursday July 7th, 2011. If
you wish to attend OWASP New Zealand Day 2011, please register your
attendance:

http://www.regonline.com/owaspnzday2011

Please remember that registration is mandatory and only available
online. Registration will be closing on the 15th June 2011. For those
of us who like to procrastinate, a reminder will be sent closer to the
time - but it would help planning if you registered sooner rather than
later.

The event web site is available at the following address:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2011

For people who missed out on the first two events, OWASP New Zealand
Day is a single day security conference entirely focused on web
application security. Talks are given both by developers and
penetration testers, giving a rounded view on the threats facing web
applications - and how to mitigate them.
In 2009 & 2010, the event had a panel of 9 speakers and attracted more
than 150 participants from all over New Zealand.

For more information, please visit last year's event conference web site:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2010

In the past, sponsors have offered coffee and lunch to all the
participants. Hopefully, we should be able to do the same this year.
New sponsors are always welcome so if you know of a company or anyone
willing to sponsor, please contact us directly at
nick.freeman at owasp.org and scott.bell at owasp.org.

The Call For Papers (CFP) and Call For Sponsors (CFS) will be released
later on today - so if you have something you'd like to present, or
would like to speak but don't know what about, now is the time to
start preparing. More details regarding presentation requirements will
be given in the CFP.

Finally, we would also like to call for volunteers to help during the
event. If you can spare a few hours to help out on the day, please let
either Scott or myself know.


Happy hacking,

Nick Freeman & Scott Bell

CALL FOR SPONSORS

As mentioned above, OWASP New Zealand Day 2011 will be held in
Auckland on the 7th of July, 2011. OWASP New Zealand Day is a security
conference entirely dedicated to web application security. The
conference is once again being hosted by the University of Auckland
with their support and assistance. OWASP New Zealand Day 2011 is a
free event, but requires sponsor support to help be an instructive and
quality event for the New Zealand community. OWASP is strictly non for
profit. The sponsorship money will be used to help make OWASP New
Zealand Day 2011 a free, compelling and valuable experience for the
audience.


The sponsorship funds collected are to be used for things such as:

* Refreshments (coffee break/lunch) - we want to keep people refreshed
during the day; while we certainly bring good and interesting
speakers, we don't want people to go home when they become hungry.
* Name tags - we feel that getting to know people within the New
Zealand community is important, and name tags make that possible.
* Promotion - up to now our events are propagating by word of mouth.
We would like to get to a wider audience by advertising our events.
* Printed Materials - printed materials will include brochures, tags
and lanyards.


-- Facts --

Last year, the event was supported by 3 sponsors and attracted more
than 150 participants. A lot of good feedback from the audience was
received and this is the reason why we are re-organising the event.
For more information on last year's event, please visit:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2010

The OWASP New Zealand community is strong and there are more than 160
people currently subscribed to the mailing-list. OWASP New Zealand Day
is expected to attract a number between 150 and 200 attendees during
the conference.

OWASP regular attendees are IT project managers, IT security managers,
IT security consultants, web application architects and developers, QA
managers, QA testers and system administrators.

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=vvOKP_gZ=tqj0SCo4_jMGg0doEg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,


We are happy to announce that training will run alongside OWASP Day
this year, on July 7th 2011. The training venue will be an auditorium
kindly provided by the University of Auckland, in the same building as
the OWASP Day conference itself. Classes will contain up to 20
students, and each seat has a power point for laptop usage.

Two 3-hour slots will be available for training, one from 9am-12noon
and a second from 2pm-5pm. As the slots are quite short, we're looking
for training events that will be providing either introductory lessons
in web app security, or sessions dedicated to a particular topic.

Examples of training topics:

+ Input filtering 101
+ Securing web services
+ Introduction to the OWASP Top 10
+ Hardening web servers
+ Mobile app security
+ Web App Security for Project Managers


If you are interested in running one of the training sessions, please
contact myself or Scott Bell with the following information:

- Trainer name
- Trainer organisation
- Telephone + email contact
- Training title
- Trainer requirements (e.g. a projector)
- Trainee requirements (e.g. laptop, VMWare/Virtualbox etc)
- Training summary (less than 500 words)
- Target audience (e.g. testers, project managers, security managers,
web developers)
- Skill level required (Basic / Intermediate / Advanced)
- A few sentences about why you think this training is important to
web application security
- What attendees can expect to learn (key objectives)
- Short Trainer bio
- List of published papers/presentations
- Course outline E.g.,
	1. Topic 1
		> Sub Topic 1.a
		> Sub Topic 1.b
		> Exercise 1
	2. Topic 2
	3. Topic 3
	> Sub Topic 3.a
	> Demo
	> Sub Topic 3.b



The fixed price per head for training will be $250. As this training
is part of an OWASP event, part of the proceeds go back to OWASP. The
split is as follows:
- 25% to OWASP Global - used for OWASP projects around the world
- 25% to OWASP NZ Day - used for expenses such as catering during the conference
- 50% to the training provider.


If you have any further queries, or wish to submit a training course,
please send the above information to the following email addresses:
- nick.freeman at owasp.org
- scott.bell at owasp.org

Accepted training sessions will be announced on June 15th, together
with the presentations.
