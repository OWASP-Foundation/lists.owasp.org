Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] OWASP Wellington next Monday: Developer's guide
	to preventing XSS
Message-ID: <CAAO0q_G=SNE6cAeQTuwoG5SCB+U-57fMq4BkWcR4hxT6DN=HeQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We've got a great session at the Wellington OWASP chapter next Monday night:

https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-New-Zealand-Chapter-Wellington/events/239202702/


Felix Shi, a product security specialist at Xero will be giving a
developers guide to preventing XSS. This will be a great introduction to
XSS if you are new to the web security space and want to find out more
about how to defend against this issue in your applications.

See you on Monday!

Kirk
