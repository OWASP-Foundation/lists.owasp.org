<PRE>Hi everyone,

I am glad to officially announce that the OWASP New Zealand Day will
be held the 13th July 2009 in Auckland. The conference venue will be
kindly provided by the University of Auckland. A wiki site has been
created and includes all the event details. The event web page is
available at the following address:

<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2009">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2009</A>

For people who missed my previous posts, this is the first *free* all
day security conference in New Zealand entirely dedicated to web
application security.

If you wish to attend, please register by clicking on the
&quot;Registration&quot; button on the event web page (above URL). Please
remember that registration is mandatory and only available online.
Registration will be closing on the 20th June 2009. I will be sending
a couple of reminders before the registration closing date.

Please invite as many people you think are interested. Many resources
are involved to organise this event and if a good number
of people attends, I am sure I won't have any issues to re-organise it
next year! ;-)

Feel free to have a link from your organisation/site to the event
page. If you want, you can use the banner available from the event
page.
Feel also free to use your email signature and have a link.

Depending on the number of sponsors and budget available, free coffee
and lunch for the attendees might be provided as well.
If you know a company or anyone willing to sponsor, please contact me
directly. I will soon publish a Call For Sponsor (CFS) including more
details.

I will also publish CFP (Call For Paper), so if you wish to talk or
you know someone who does, then you are more than welcome to contact
me.

If there is anyone who has contacts with media, please let me know as
Rob and myself will be promoting the event from now on.

Last but not least, if anyone feels to help/volunteer during the
event, please drop me an email.

Again thanks very much for your attention,

Roberto Suggi Liverani
OWASP NZ Leader
</PRE>
