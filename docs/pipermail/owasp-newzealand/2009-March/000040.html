<PRE>OWASP Day New Zealand 2009

CALL FOR SPONSOR

Proposal

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Day New Zealand Call for
Sponsor (CFS) is out!

The OWASP day New Zealand is the first all day security conference
entirely dedicated to web application security in New Zealand.
The event is free, and is in line with the OWASP open source and not
for profit model.

The OWASP New Zealand Day 2009 will be held on 13th July 2009. The
conference venue will be provided by the University of Auckland. The
OWASP Day Auckland 2009 will be a free for entry event. Sponsors are
invited to help the OWASP New Zealand Day to be a free, instructive
and quality event for the New Zealand internet community.

The sponsorship funds collected will be used for things such as:

- Lecture videos &#8211; the filmed presentations can be shared online and
made available also to people who cannot make it to the conference.
- Refreshments - we want to keep people at the event for an extended
period, and we certainly bring in a variety of speakers keeping the
event interesting and informative, therefore we don't want people to
go home when they become hungry.
- Name tags &#8211; a lot of social networking is done at these events so we
feel that getting to know each other is important and name tags make
this easier.
- Promotion - Until now our events have been propagated by word of
mouth. We would like to reach a wider audience by advertising the
OWASP events.
- Printed Materials - We would like to start handing out printed
material at our conferences.
- International Speaker(s) - With sufficient funds we aim to be able
to invite quality international speakers who add real value to the
OWASP event.

Facts

The OWASP NZ community is strong and there are 78 people currently
subscribed to the mailing-list.
We have an average of 50 people attending in Auckland and 10/15 people
in Wellington at our regular meetings. This event is expected to
attract at least 100 attendees for the conference which will be hosted
by the University of Auckland.
OWASP regular attendees are IT project managers, IT security managers,
IT security consultants, web application architect and developers, QA
managers, QA testers, system administrators and students.
The OWASP NZ chapter meetings have received some excellent feedback
and a lot of work has been done over the last year making improvements
as can be seen at:
