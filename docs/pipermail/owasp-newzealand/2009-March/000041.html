<PRE>Hi all,

This is a reminder for the OWASP NZ Chapter meeting which will be held
this Thursday, the 19th March. Please read the email below for venue
location and contact details.

Regarding Auckland, please confirm your registration. Later today, I
will send the list of registered people to Vodafone. If someone hasn't
registered yet, please do so.

Note that there is a change in the meeting agenda as Muhaimin
Dzulfakar will not be able to talk due to another commitment. I will
be speaking instead about JavaScript reversing and JavaScript malware.

See you all there,

Cheers,

Roberto Suggi Liverani
OWASP NZ Leader

Happy New Year everyone!

2008 has been a very productive year for OWASP NZ and our OWASP NZ web
page just speaks for itself
(<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/New_Zealand">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/New_Zealand</A>) with a total of ten
presentations and five meetings. The OWASP Board is really happy with
the good work done.

The number of attendees increased considerably reaching the number of
50 people in the last meeting. Undoubtly, this is a sign of positive
feedback from the NZ IT security community. Again, I really thank
everyone and especially the speakers, the sponsors, the attendees and
all the people who proactively helped myself and Rob Munro to organise
the meetings.

Considering the successful results in 2008, I thought that it will be
great to have an OWASP Day conference this year! The first OWASP Day
in NZ!

OWASP Day is an all-day security conference event dedicated entirely
to web application security. At this stage, myself and Rob are
planning the venue and the date most probably is the 13th July 2009.
The event will be held in Auckland. At the end of the next week, I
should be able to give an update including more details. A CFP (Call
for Paper) and CFS (Call For Sponsor) will also be published soon if
everything goes well and we will then focus on the promotion of the
event.

Before the OWASP Day, we are going to have a chapter meeting on the
19th of March (Thursday). In Auckland, we will be kindly sponsored by
Vodafone New Zealand and Security-Assessment.com. Again, thanks very
much to Andrew Davey for supporting OWASP. Security-Assessment.com
will also be sponsoring the event in Wellington.

The meeting will be held at 6.30 pm. An audio-conference will be setup
between Auckland and Wellington as the previous time.

Auckland people: please note that PRE-REGISTRATION is mandatory.
Please send an email to robertosl (at) owasp.org with your first name
and last name. **People who fails to pre-register will not be granted
access to the Vodafone building**.

Wellington people: location remains the same as the previous one and
please reserve your attendance to Blair Strang ( 021 229 7231 ).

Speakers will be Paul Craig and Muhaimin Dzulfakar from Security-Assessment.com.

Paul will be speaking about ActiveX Exploitation in 2009. The talk
will cover the who, how, what, where, when, wtf? of ActiveX technology
and ActiveX Exploitation in 2009.

Muhaimin (Emmy) will talk about his new *beta* SQL injection tool
&quot;Mysqloit&quot;. Mysqloit exploits SQL injection flaws to get remote shell
on systems running Mysql database server. Demo will also be included.

Regarding the next OWASP meeting, food and drinks will be provided as usual.

Meeting co-sponsor: Vodafone New Zealand/Security-Assessment.com
(Auckland) and Security-Assessment.com (Wellington)

Meeting Locations:

Auckland Venue location:
Vodafone New Zealand
Ground Floor
20 Viaduct Harbour Avenue
