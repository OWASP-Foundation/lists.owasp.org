Hi everyone,
This is a reminder for OWASP NZ meeting tonight.

Update:

We also got another speaker, Muhaimin Dzulfakar, who will talk about "Time
based blind SQL injection" from Wellington.

Auckland people: I will be the only onsite contact (021 928 780)
Wellington people: for onsite contact and access to building please refer to
Muhaimin Dzulfakar (021776410) or Blair Strang (0277106450). Thanks.

The original meeting email above:

We have another sponsor (Microsoft) who will provide venue, food and drinks
in Auckland. Microsoft will provide us a larger meeting room considering
that the previous meeting room in Auckland is usually crowded.

The meeting will be held the 3rd September at 6.30 pm.

Auckland people: please note the venue location is changed. (Location
details at the bottom)
Wellington people: location remains the same as the previous one.

I will be speaking briefly about browser security. If anyone else wants to
present, please let me know.

Also, I really strongly recommend people in this mailing-list to attend the
next Kiwicon (www.kiwicon.org) security conference at the end of September.
Believe me when I tell you this is a unique security event in NZ with very
good content - so don't miss it.

Regarding the next OWASP meeting, food and drinks will be provided as usual.
Teleconference between Auckland
and Wellington will be setup.

Auckland people please confirm attendance to myself or to Rob Munro.
Wellington people please confirm attendance to Mark Piper. (Contact details
at the bottom)

Meeting Locations:

So what do you expect from a digest? You chose digest mode so you
wouldn't be bothered by every little email. Don't complain about your
own choices.

Hi everyone,
Thanks for attending the OWASP meeting yesterday. I am sorry we couldn't
have video-conference but next time, hopefully, it is going to be better.
Big thanks to Muhaimin Dzulfakar for his very good presentation.

Also, I want to thank Microsoft for sponsoring the event in Auckland and
especially Alec Lawton and Dave Gautrey for setting up everything.

Unfortunately, we had a problem yesterday. Someone took a Microsoft access
card and did not return it. Multiple access cards were kindly made available
to access bathrooms and to enter/exit from the building.

Honestly, I don't think it has been lost and I do not understand and do not
tolerate this type of immature attitude.

Sponsors offer us food/drinks/venue for free and that should be respected
and appreciated. People who fail to understand this simple concept should
not be part of the OWASP chapter.

We have informal/friendly meetings but this is not a reason/occasion to
downgrade the quality of what we do. At the opposite, this atmosphere should
help people socialise, interact and contribute to OWASP.

Finally, as I don't like to repeat myself, I am pretty confident this type
of issue won't happen in the future again.

Regards,

Roberto Suggi Liverani
OWASP NZ Leader

Hi everyone,

Just a follow-up from yesterday. I have spoken with Microsoft and they are
keen to sponsor the event only if the card is returned.

So if anyone feels compelled to return this card, and (for whatever reason)
wishes to keep their anonymity then simply post the card to:
