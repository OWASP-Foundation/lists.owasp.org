<PRE>Hi everyone,

Thanks for attending the meeting yesterday. It was great and we really
had good fun. Big thanks to Dean Jerkovich and to Paul Craig for their
presentations. Thanks to Mark Piper and Rob Munro for helping me in
setting up the meetings.

I heard that some other people would like to present at the next
meetings. That's good. Anyone is more than welcome to do so. If you
have a topic in mind, please let me know.

Our activities and previous presentations can be found at:

Please also note that our chapter is contributing to the OWASP
Education project as well. Link:

Cheers,
