Hi all,

With under a week til the next chapter meeting, it's about time for an
update. Thanks to everyone who has registered so far on Meetup. For those
that haven't, please click the link and do the form-filling thing here:
http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-New-Zealand-Chapter/events/115108982/

Expect an update next week for details regarding our web cast of the event.

Please find below our venerable speakers!


Speaker 1: Adrian Hayes
Talk: The New OWASP Top 10
A release candidate for the new OWASP Top 10 Web Risks has been made
publicly available. The OWASP Top 10 is widely regarded as the best
starting point when it comes to web application security. We'll cover what
has changed, including new risks that are now encompassed as part of the
top 10.

Bio: Adrian is a security consultant for the Security-Assessment.com,
providing clients with security penetration testing services and security
related advice. He has deep knowledge of secure design and architecture,
mobile device & application security, cryptography, and social engineering
based attacks. Adrian is an active security researcher, and leads the
Wellington OWASP chapter.

Speaker 2: Simon Burson
Talk: "Secure By Design" considers a practical approach to building
security into an organization.  Having read and written a whole lot of
idealistic papers and standards; I have come to realise most use them as a
gravity aided weapon for crushing those with an idea.  This is a case
example of an approach that is ensuring those pen test results are
pre-determined.  An approach that avoids the rolling of eyes when risks are
signed off.  It is a work in progress and while delivering some benefits,
it is certainly open to heckling from the crowd.  Of course it could be
that the approach is perfect and there is no room for improvement... baited
yet?

Bio: Simon a.k.a taz, the ever argumentative telco flipping lobbyist for
all things that bring down PCI.  As the man who once did a SLA for the
Internet, I am a creative chap who builds wondrous clouds during the week
and destroys lil critters in the weekends.


Thanks go out as always to our chapter sponsors, Touchpoint and
Security-Assessment.com for providing refreshments and venue.

If you have any questions please ask Adrian or myself - and we'll see you
next week!


Regards
Nick Freeman & Adrian Hayes
