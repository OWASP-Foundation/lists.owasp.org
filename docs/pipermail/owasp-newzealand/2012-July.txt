Message-ID: <4FFE57F8.5050403@owasp.org>

Hi Everyone,

Space for OWASP Day 2012 coming up on the 31th August is quickly filling
up and we are over half way to capacity. If you have colleagues, friends, or
a development team that hasn't registered, please point them towards the
event page at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2012.

The Call for Papers and Call for Trainers is only open for another few
days and will be closing on the 15th of July. We welcome new speakers,
so if you have something you'd like to share please get your submissions
in to us ASAP. We have more speaking slots to fill this year than
previous years and time is running out, so don't hold back!

If you have any questions, please email myself (adrian.hayes at owasp.org)
and Nick Freeman (nick.freeman at owasp.org).

Kind Regards,
Nick Freeman and Adrian Hayes
OWASP New Zealand Chapter Leaders

Hi Everyone,

OWASP Day 2012 in Auckland on the 31st of August is shaping up to be
another great conference. We've had some excellent speaker submissions
so far but we know some of you are struggling to meet the deadline. We
have decided to extend the call for papers and trainers deadline by one
week. CFP and CFT will now close on the 22nd of July.

OWASP is about the free and open sharing of security information and we
are always delighted to be able to invite new speakers to present at the
conference. If you have something to say about security that will
benefit the app development community please fill out our CFP template
below and email it to myself (adrian.hayes at owasp.org) and Nick Freeman
(nick.freeman at owasp.org) by the 22nd.
