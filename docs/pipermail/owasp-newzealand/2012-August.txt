Hi Everyone,


Registrations have now closed for OWASP Day 2012 on the 31st of August
in Auckland. We are completely full for the main conference event, but
have a few spaces left in each of the training sessions so will be
extending the registration deadline until Sunday the 26th of August.

If you missed out you can still register for a training session on the
30th of August which also gains you access to the main conference event
the following day. This year we are hosting two training workshops:

 * Test Driven Security - PentesterLab
 * Teaching the Good-Guys Bad-Tricks - Aura Infosec

You can get all the details about these workshops including registration
