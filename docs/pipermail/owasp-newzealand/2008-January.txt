Hi All,



Apologies for the intrusion. I assume the offer of free drinks will get me off the hook. Prospective members are also welcome to come to these meetings (but please RSVP) and the presentations cover topics that may be of interest including the .nz domain name dispute resolution service and IDNs.



Regards,



Michael
