Hi all,

2009 has been an important year for the OWASP New Zealand chapter.
We have organised the first OWASP Day event in New Zealand, attracting
more than 150 people.

A lot of good feedback was received and I believe it is a great result
for this chapter.

Ideally, I would like to organise another OWASP Day event in July/August.
I am open to feedback regarding the organisation, so please feel free to
write in this mailing-list or send an email to myself.

For those people who have missed the first OWASP Day event,
please have a look to this page:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2009

Also, I am always looking for speakers for our regular chapter meetings.
OWASP meetings are informal and friendly, so please don't be afraid to talk
or suggest a new discussion topic.

Next week, we are going to have a chapter meeting on the
4th of March (Thursday). In Auckland, we will be kindly sponsored by
Vodafone New Zealand and Security-Assessment.com. Again, thanks very
much to Andrew Davey for supporting OWASP. Security-Assessment.com
will also be sponsoring the event in Wellington.

The meeting will be held at 6.30 pm. An audio-conference will be setup
between Auckland and Wellington.

Auckland people: please note that PRE-REGISTRATION is mandatory.
Please send an email to robertosl (at) owasp.org with your first name
and last name. **People who fails to pre-register will not be granted
access to the Vodafone building**.

Wellington people: location remains the same as the previous one and
please reserve your attendance to Blair Strang ( 021 229 7231 ).

Speaker will be Scott Bell from Security-Assessment.com.

Scott will be speaking about MS-SQL SQL injection. The talk will cover
different aspects of MS-SQL SQL injection. It will start off with an
overview of SQL injection and as the talk progresses, will get into the
technical side of it. Scott will talk about automated tools, their uses,
and also their failures and why the need to manually test is essential.

Food and drinks will be provided as usual.

Meeting co-sponsor: Vodafone New Zealand/Security-Assessment.com
(Auckland) and Security-Assessment.com (Wellington)

Meeting Locations:

Auckland Venue location:
