Hi everyone,
Good news for OWASP NZ!

We have another sponsor (Microsoft) who will provide venue, food and
drinks in Auckland. Microsoft will provide us a larger meeting room
considering that the previous meeting room in Auckland is usually crowded.

The meeting will be held the 3rd September at 6.30 pm.

Auckland people: please note the venue location is changed. (Location
details at the bottom)
Wellington people: location remains the same as the previous one.

I will be speaking briefly about browser security. If anyone else wants to
present, please let me know.

Also, I really strongly recommend people in this mailing-list to attend the
next Kiwicon (www.kiwicon.org) security conference at the end of
September. Believe me when I tell you this is a unique security event in
NZ with very good content - so don't miss it.

Regarding the next OWASP meeting, food and drinks will be provided as usual.
Teleconference between Auckland
and Wellington will be setup.

Auckland people please confirm attendance to myself or to Rob Munro.
Wellington people please confirm attendance to Mark Piper. (Contact details
at the bottom)

Meeting co-sponsor: Microsoft (Auckland) and Security-Assessment.com
(Wellington)

Meeting Locations:

Auckland Venue location:
Microsoft
Lift to the 5th Reception
22 Viaduct Harbour Avenue, adjacent to Vodafone

Wellington Venue location:

3rd Floor Lumley House
Hunter Street
