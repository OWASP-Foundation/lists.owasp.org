Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] OWASP New Zealand Chapter Leadership - Auckland
Message-ID: <CAMEy1Qi_9uNd1WjpAkmX2t23TeGpxHLzdae8xFHHX59y=Xo3xQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

As discussed at the last chapter meeting in 2013, I am stepping down as
chapter leader for Auckland. Taking my place is Denis Andzakovic - included
on this email. Denis has been helping out with the operation of chapter
meetings and OWASP day over the past couple of years and already has some
plans for this coming year. Please welcome him aboard!


Look forward to seeing you all at the next meeting.


Cheers,
Nick.
