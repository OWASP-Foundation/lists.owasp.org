Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] 2nd NZ Owasp meeting organization
Message-ID: <20070725075703.g74wk4kwgc0co8wk@202.180.66.4>

Hi everyone,

We would like to organize the 2nd NZ Owasp meeting the next month.
Before we decide a date we would like to invite people to make a
presentation/speech about web application security topics.

As we mentioned in the first meeting, the spirit of these initiatives is
interaction and knowledge exchange so anyone willing to talk about a subject
in the web application security area is more than welcome.

Please extend this invitation to anyone you know that might be interested. We
would also like to involve security professionals from government institutions
and from universities.

Please also consider this mailing-list as a web application security forum.

Thanks to Brendan Murray for the link about Top 10 Web Application Hack
Attacks. This is just an example of what we can talk about during our meetings.

Shekhar Aryan, welcome to this group!

Last point: if your company is willing to host us please let us know.

Thanks again,

Roberto Suggi Liverani
