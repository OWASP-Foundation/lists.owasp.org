<PRE>Hi everyone,

The Call For Papers (CFP) and Call for Trainers (CFT) are set to close
on May 31st - that's a week away. So if you have a talk in mind, get
your CFP response together and send it through to myself
(<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">nick.freeman at owasp.org</A>) and Scott (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">scott.bell at owasp.org</A>). For those
of you who have mentioned that you have something to talk about, now
would be a good time to send through a talk abstract, speakers bio etc
- as per the CFP on the website
(<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2011#tab=Call_for_Papers_and_review_process">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2011#tab=Call_for_Papers_and_review_process</A>).
We are looking for 30-45 minute talks as well as 10-15 minute
lightning talks - perfect if you have something worth talking about,
but not enough content for a full talk.Speakers and trainers will be
announced on June 15th, 2011.

Also, if you have been procrastinating, now would be a good time to
register. The registration form can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.regonline.com/Register/Checkin.aspx?EventID=967373.">http://www.regonline.com/Register/Checkin.aspx?EventID=967373.</A> Please
note that registration closes on June 20th.

Our thanks go out to Security-Assessment.com, Lateral Security and F5
for sponsoring OWASP NZ Day 2011. Sponsors help us keep OWASP NZ Day a
free conference, and we are very grateful for their continued support.

If you have any questions regarding the conference, please email
either Scott or myself.



Kind Regards,

Nick Freeman
OWASP New Zealand Chapter Leader (Auckland)
