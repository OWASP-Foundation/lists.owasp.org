Application Security for Web Developers

Course Abstract:

The 2 days hands-on course targets web developers, security auditors,
penetration testers, security managers and anyone else who wants to
learn to write secure code or to audit code against security flaws.

The course covers each and every vulnerability in depth and talks  about
a variety of best security practices and defence-in-depth approach which
developers should keep in mind while developing applications.

The attendees will be provided access to infrastructure on which they
will be practising to identify vulnerable code and subsequently discuss
patching approaches.

While the course covers industry standards such as OWASP Top 10 and SANS
top 25 security issues, it also talks about real world issues which
don't find a mention in these lists.

The course does not focus on any particular web development language  or
technology but focus on the principles. It includes examples from  PHP,
.NET, classic ASP and Java.
