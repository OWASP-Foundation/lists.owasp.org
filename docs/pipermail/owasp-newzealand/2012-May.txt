Hi,

Please remember to RSVP by this Friday, and state whether you will be
attending the Auckland or Wellington meeting for catering purposes.
Auckland RSVP: nick.freeman at owasp.org
Wellington RSVP: scott.bell at owasp.org

This month we will have Mark 'Pipes' Piper of Insomnia Security
presenting. Please find the details for the presentation below:


Abstract
---
In 2009 during a talk entitled "Application Bug Chaining" I demoed
some work made possible due to the development of BeEF (Browser
Exploitation Framework).

Since that talk, BeEF has undergone a massive re-architecture and
complete rewrite with a number of developers contributing a raft of
useful features and modules. This talk will focus on looking at what
some of the new features and modules provide and how they can be used
by both web application developers and application security testers.
We will also take some time to introduce the new BeEF RESTful API.

Time permitting, we might fire a live demo.


Bio
---
Mark works for Insomnia Security where his official job title is "To
Be Advised".

Building on a few years in the Information Security industry, his day
work primarily focuses on execution of red team exercises, source code
reviews, web application testing and wrangling crazy attack ideas into
reality.
