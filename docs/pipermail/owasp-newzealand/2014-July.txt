Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] OWASP Update and Security Workshops
Message-ID: <53BC75BA.1070106@owasp.org>

Good new everyone! [1]

OWASP NZ is holding a series of web app security workshops where we'll
show you the basics on how common web application vulnerabilities can be
exploited. These will be happening this month (wlg, alk) and in Sept
(chch). You should have a basic knowledge about web apps (HTML,
JavaScript, SQL, that kind of thing) and you MUST bring your own laptop.

Spaces are limited, so we'll be using meetup.com to organise everything.
We now have one meetup page per location, so if you've previously signed
up to the Auckland OWASP meetup page, but you're in Wellington or
Christchurch, best move yourself to the right one so can you can get
updates on what's happening in your area.

Auckland

Workshop Date: July TBA

Wellington

Finally, for those of you wondering when the OWASP Day conference is
going to happen, we've pushed back the date on that one for a number of
reasons and while exact dates are to be arranged, we expect to be
holding the next one in February next year. Keep an eye on the mailing
list for more details.


Cheers,
