<PRE>Hi All,



The OWASP NZ crew are pleased to announce the 8th OWASP New Zealand Day
conference, to be held at the University of Auckland. As per previous
years, OWASP NZ Day 2017 will be a free conference dedicated to application
security with an emphasis on secure dev techniques and management. The con
will be held on the 20th of April, with training being run the day before
(19th of April). Further information is available on the event wiki page
here: <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2017">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2017</A>



The registration link can be found here: <A HREF="https://owaspnz2017.eventbrite.com">https://owaspnz2017.eventbrite.com</A>
Please note that registration cut off is the 15th of April. We have plenty
of seats, and though we've come to expect the flood of last minute emails
from those of you that are either forgetful or just plain lazy, it messes
with our numbers. It also hurts our collective feelings. So register. Do it.



We have a large number of presenter slots to fill. We're interested in
topics covering everything from introductory topics, to deeply technical
subjects to risk and compliance. Presentation submissions are welcome from
all interested parties, and we're especially keen to hear from the
developers and other technical communities, not just the professional
infosec nerds. We will not consider vendor pitches, commercial content or
other such attempts to pedal your filthy, filthy wares. More info is
available here:

CFP Deadline: 18th of March



This year we have a number of training slots to fill. If you have a
security related training you'd like to give the day before the main con,
then please sub! More info is available here:

CFT Deadline: 28th of Feb



OWASP is strictly not for profit and to keep our conference free we need
sponsors to support us. The sponsorship cash is used to help make OWASP NZ
Day a free and valuable experience for the audience. More details on
sponsorship specifics available here:
