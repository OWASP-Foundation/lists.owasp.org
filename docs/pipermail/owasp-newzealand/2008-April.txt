Hi everyone,

There are some important news regarding the OWASP NZ chapter that I would
like to share with you.
We have a new sponsor which is Security-Assessment.com. The sponsor will not
just provide venue, food and drinks but also teleconference capability.
This will allow us to connect to Wellington's office and consequently people
from Wellington will be able to join Auckland's chapter meetings and vice
versa.
Food and drinks will also be provided in Wellington.

I personally believe this is a great achievement for OWASP NZ as we are now
able to cover two main cities of New Zealand.

Mark Piper will be responsible for organising the meeting in Wellington.
(Thanks again pipes ;-) ). People from Wellington, please confirm attendance
to Mark (email: mark.piper(AT)security-assessment.com or mobile: 021 590
598)

The other good news is that we have Paul Craig speaking about "Hacking The
World With Flash". I will also be presenting on "Web Spam Techniques".

The date for the next OWASP NZ meeting is the 29th April at 6.30 pm.

Auckland Venue location:

Corner Victoria and Queen Street
Phillip Fox Building,
7th Floor

Wellington Venue location:

3rd Floor Lumley Housed
Hunter Street

Participation is free and open to all but please confirm your attendance as
we need to order some food and drinks.

If you would like to speak at the next meeting please send us a title and
abstract of your proposed topic.

Hi all,

I would like to thank all people (about 35!) attending the NZ OWASP meeting
yesterday. We really had a great evening and the teleconference with
Wellington was also great . I am really satisfied about the result and the
quality of discussions arised by the presentations. New faces also showed up
and that's an indication that things are starting to get better.

Again, I would like to extend my invitation to all of you to talk/present at
the next OWASP meetings. Feel free to propose any topic related to web app
security in general as long it is not a sale speech. OWASP presentations
are detached from any vendor/sponsor.

Finally, special thanks goes to Paul Craig for showing us Flash and its
security features ;-) , to Rob Munro for helping me organising the meeting
and to Mark Piper for organising on Wellington side.

Cheers,

Roberto
