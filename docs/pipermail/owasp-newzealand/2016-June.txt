Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] [CROSS-POST] OWASP Wellington - Introduction to
 using a web application firewall
Message-ID: <CAAPk=ZYaq0uwZAUri9NcfxsQhqS5oi5jqbW9LPndAxo-kEGCiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We're having an OWASP meetup in Wellington next Monday, and it would be
great if you could come -- and spread the word to your friends and
colleagues!

http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-New-Zealand-Chapter-Wellington/events/232017285/

It would be great to have some regular web development folk attend, so if
you have contact with web dev teams in Wellington I'd appreciate if you can
forward the link to them.

We also intend to try and stream the event via a Youtube livestream, so at
approx 6pm next Monday this link _should_ give you access to Graeme's video
stream:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAPFf9Iqwos

A recording will be at the same location afterwards.

*Date:* Monday 27 June

*Time: *5:45pm for a 6pm start

*Title: *Understanding how to protect your site using a WAF

*Audience:* Anyone involved in web development

*Location:* RedShield offices - someone will let you up the lifts

*Synopsis:*

Deploying a website or application on the internet isn't the end... as soon
as it's on the internet, anyone with a browser can access it (and attack
it).

A popular approach to dealing with urgent security issues is to put a web
application firewall in front of your application. This process is normally
fraught with pain, and often doesn't lead to the the security benefits
expected.

Graeme and his team have a different approach to deployment, and the way
they approach using a WAF might be different to others you have heard
about. Graeme will discuss his approach, the benefits, and show how you
could implement a WAF yourself, successfully.

This talk assumes no knowledge of web application firewalls or security,
and will introduce the necessary concepts. Following this talk, Graeme may
delve deeper into the internals of how they build solutions, if people are
keen!

Cheers!

Kirk
OWASP Wellington Chapter Lead
