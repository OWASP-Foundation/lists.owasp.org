Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand]  OWASP NZ Day 2018 - Registration,
 call for presentations, trainers and sponsors
Message-ID: <92c2f2bd-c409-3a7a-47ff-6dde5c2ede66@owasp.org>

Hi All,

The OWASP NZ crew are pleased to announce the 9th OWASP New Zealand Day 
conference, to be held at the University of Auckland. As per previous 
years, OWASP NZ Day 2018 will be a free conference dedicated to 
information security with an emphasis on secure development techniques 
and management. The con will be held on the 5th of February, with 
training being run the day before (4th of February). Further information 
is available on the event wiki page here: 
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2018 
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2018>

The registration link can be found here: 
https://owaspnz2018.eventbrite.com/ 
<https://owaspnz2018.eventbrite.com/> Please note that registration cut 
off is the 29th of January. We have plenty of seats, and though we've 
come to expect the flood of last minute emails from those of you that 
are either forgetful or just plain lazy, it messes with our numbers. It 
also hurts our collective feelings. So register. Do it.

We have a large number of presenter slots to fill. We're interested in 
topics covering everything from introductory topics, to deeply technical 
subjects to risk and compliance. Presentation submissions are welcome 
from all interested parties, and we're especially keen to hear from the 
developers and other technical communities, not just the professional 
infosec nerds. We will not consider vendor pitches or commercial 
content. More info is available here:

OWASP is strictly not for profit and to keep our conference free we need 
sponsors to support us. The sponsorship cash is used to help make OWASP 
NZ Day a free and valuable experience for the audience. More details on 
sponsorship specifics available here:
