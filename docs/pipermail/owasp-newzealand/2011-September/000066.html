<PRE>Hi everyone,

This is a reminder to RSVP if you will be attending the upcoming OWASP
NZ Chapter meeting. The meeting details are:

Date: September 20th, 2011
Time: From 6.30PM
Locations: Auckland and Wellington (details can be found further down
in this email)

Please RSVP to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">nick.freeman at owasp.org</A> (Auckland) or
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand">scott.bell at owasp.org</A> (Wellington).
We will have two talks at this meeting, and the total presentation
time is expected to be approximately an hour.

Presentation 1
-
Title: Introduction to the OWASP Top Ten - Part 1
Presenter: Nick Freeman
Abstract: This is the first in a series of 3 presentations that will
introduce the OWASP Top Ten risks to developers. The target audience
for this presentation is developers new to OWASP or unfamiliar with
secure coding practices and the risks that web applications face on a
daily basis.
Part 1 will cover the first 3 of the OWASP Top Ten: Injection,
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Broken Authentication and Session
Management.

Presentation 2
-
Title: Clickjacking for Shells
Presenter: Andrew Horton
Abstract: Two years after the world was warned about clickjacking,
popular web apps are still vulnerable and no web app exploits have
been published. With many security pros considering clickjacking to
have mere nuisance value on social networks, the attack is grossly
underestimated. I will demonstrate step by step how to identify
vulnerable applications, how to write exploits that attack web apps
and also how to protect against  clickjacking. To demonstrate this
issue I will publish an 0day clickjacking exploit for WordPress v3.1.2
and earlier to gain a shell on the webserver. In May this year the
tech media reported and speculated upon clickjacking protection being
implemented in WordPress and now I will show you why it is so
important.


This meeting's food and drink will be sponsored by Security-Assessment.com.


If you have any questions, please email myself or Scott.

Kind Regards
