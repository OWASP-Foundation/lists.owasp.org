Hi all,

Due to mailing list issues we haven't been able to make any
announcements for a while. As this has now been resolved, here are
some brief announcements!

* Slides from OWASP Day 2012 are now available online at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2012 - thanks
everyone for coming along and making this a great day.

* Kiwicon 6 is just over 3 weeks away, and tickets are almost sold
out. If you haven't registered yet, you should do so - it's a great
conference with high quality talks. See https://kiwicon.org/ for more
details.

* We will have our last chapter meeting of the year in early December.
Registration for the event will open at a later date - for now, please
send an email to nick.freeman at owasp.org and adrian.hayes at owasp.org if
you have an idea for a talk.


That about sums it up. Hope to see you at Kiwicon!


Regards

Nick Freeman & Adrian Hayes
OWASP New Zealand Chapter Leaders
