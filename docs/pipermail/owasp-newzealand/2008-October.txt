Hi everyone,

The next OWASP NZ Chapter in Auckland will be kindly sponsored by Vodafone
New Zealand. Special thanks to Andrew Dawey for this.
Security-Assessment.com will be sponsoring the event in Wellington.

The meeting will be held the 5th November at 6.30 pm. An audio-conference
will be setup between Auckland and Wellington. Sorry no video-conference
this time.

Auckland people: please note that PRE-REGISTRATION is mandatory. Please send
an email to robertosl (at) owasp.org with your first name and last name.
**People who fails to pre-register will not be granted access to the
Vodafone building**.

Wellington people: location remains the same as the previous one and please
reserve your attendance to Mark Pipes.

Speakers will be Brett Moore from Insomnia Security and Beau Butler from
Security-Assessment.com.

Brett's presentation will be about "Common Application Flaws - Explain,
Detect, Prevent".

This presentation will cover a large number of common application
vulnerabilities that are often seen in web applications. Each flaw will be
explained and demonstrated and then advice will be provided on how to detect
these issues in your applications, and how to prevent them from been
exploited.

The OWASP Top Ten will be covered and whatever else decides to fall into the
slides. Topics will include authorisation and authentication, injection
flaws, file handling, cryptography and secret handling, server
configuration, logic flaws, and the most common mistakes in java, php, and
asp.net.

Beau will talk about the most recent Clickjacking vulnerability and the
various implications from a security point view.

I will also be giving a very short talk on the recent advisory I disclosed
to Opera and about the upcoming OWASP testing guide version 3.

Regarding the next OWASP meeting, food and drinks will be provided as usual.
