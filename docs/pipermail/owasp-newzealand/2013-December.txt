Application Security for Web Developers

Course Abstract:

The 2 days hands-on course targets web developers, security auditors,
penetration testers, security managers and anyone else who wants to
learn to write secure code or to audit code against security flaws.

The course covers each and every vulnerability in depth and talks  about
a variety of best security practices and defence-in-depth approach which
developers should keep in mind while developing applications.

The attendees will be provided access to infrastructure on which they
will be practising to identify vulnerable code and subsequently discuss
patching approaches.

While the course covers industry standards such as OWASP Top 10 and SANS
top 25 security issues, it also talks about real world issues which
don't find a mention in these lists.

The course does not focus on any particular web development language  or
technology but focus on the principles. It includes examples from  PHP,
.NET, classic ASP and Java.

As you can see, we have our first chapter meeting in Christchurch this

that we can now reach more of New Zealand than ever before. Details
regarding the webcast will be released closer to the meeting date.

Our previous chapter meeting saw us using Meetup for RSVPs. This is much
easier to manage than multiple mailboxes. All future meeting announcements
will be via Meetup and this mailing list. Please find our Meetup event

As with previous meetings, food and drink will be provided courtesy of our
sponsors, Security-Assessment.com and TouchPoint.

At this stage we have one presentation planned but are looking for more -
so if you have something you'd like to talk about, please let us know. Your
talk doesn't need to be any specific length, as long as it is related to
web & application security, we're keen to hear your idea!


Please contact us with any questions.

Regards
OWASP New Zealand Chapter Leaders
