Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] Christchurch Hacker Con (CHCon) 2016 - Call for
 Presentations Training and Sponsors
Message-ID: <15653f6b5ed.daaf098f127411.1465686684146237814@chcon.nz>



Hi Everyone


We are proud to announce the first Christchurch Hacker Conference (CHCon), to be held at the Ara Institute of Canterbury (formerly Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology, CPIT) on Sunday 13th November, 2016. The call for presenters, trainers, and sponsors is now open. We will open registration for general attendees in the coming weeks, so stay tuned as registrations will be limited.


CHCon is a one-day conference dedicated to technology security with an emphasis on both breaking and building.


We will be offering training on the day before the conference (Saturday 12th November).


We have a large amount of presenter slots that we need to fill, on everything from the [Suggested Topics](Link to CFP Session Types id). Presentation submissions are welcome from all interested parties, we're not interested in vendor pitches or commercial content. More information is available here: https://2016.chcon.nz/CALL4P~1.HTM


We also have a number of training slots we'd like to fill. If you have a security related training you'd like to give the day before the main conference, please make a submission. More information is available here: https://2016.chcon.nz/CALL4T~1.HTM


CHCon is strictly not for profit and to keep our conference fee as cheap as possible, we need sponsors to support us. The sponsorship money is used to help make CHCon, an instructive and quality event for the Canterbury &amp; NZ tech community. More information about sponsorship is available here: https://2016.chcon.nz/CALL4S~1.HTM


Event Website: https://2016.chcon.nz/


Thanks from the CHCon crew

Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] [CROSS-POST] OWASP Wellington - Intro to the
	OWASP Mobile Top 10
Message-ID: <CAAPk=ZbT_kf9eunSzqtrBVKhMfhxkQEHi9BCL=qQYHLOznDt-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We're having an OWASP meetup in Wellington on Monday 29 August, and it
would be great if you could come -- and spread the word to your friends and
colleagues!

http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-New-Zealand-Chapter-Wellington/events/232212284/


It would be great to have a wide range of mobile developers attend, so if
you know any in Wellington I'd appreciate if you can forward the link to
them.

We also intend to try and stream the event via a Youtube livestream, so at
approx 6pm on the 29th, this link _should_ give you access to Mike's video
stream:

*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbXO6wNvOM4
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbXO6wNvOM4>*

A recording will be at the same location afterwards.

*Date:* Monday 29 August

*Time: *5:45pm for a 6pm start

*Title: *Into to the OWASP Mobile Top 10

*Audience:* Anyone involved in mobile app development

*Location:* To be determined - keep an eye on Meetup

*Synopsis:*

If you're a mobile application developer, or interested in how to secure
applications, then this session is for you!

Mike Haworth from Insomnia will be introducing us to the OWASP Top 10 for
Mobile - a collection of mobile security issues that commonly occur in
applications.

This will be an introductory talk on the topic of mobile security, and so
should be suitable for anyone interested in the topic. Some concepts may
assume a bit of development knowledge, but Mike can elaborate on them if
they are unclear.

*Signup:*

Cheers!

OWASP Wellington Chapter Lead
