Please note that this is the same location of the previous meeting. An

Participation is free and open to all but please confirm your attendance
as we need to order some food and drinks.

If you would like to speak at the this meeting please send us a title
and abstract of your proposed topic. Currently there is only one
presentation for this meeting so it would be
ideal if someone would be able to bring another presentation as well.

the OWASP mission in NZ. If you want to join us, please let us know.

The proposed presentation for this meeting is about Xpath Injection.

Thanks,

Roberto Suggi Liverani
