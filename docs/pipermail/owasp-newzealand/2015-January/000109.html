<PRE>Hi All,

February at the University of Auckland is now open. The main conferences
is, as always, free and spaces are limited but we would love to see you
there. More details can be found here:

There is one week left to submit talks so time is running out! If you
have something you'd like to talk about and we'd love to hear from you.

We would also like to announce this years sponsors which allow us to
keep the conference free and accessible to as many as possible.
Our main sponsors are:

* Insomnia Security

Followed by Beca as a silver sponsor, Binary Mist as a support sponsor.


Keep an eye out for an announcement of the paid training sessions to be

interested!


Thanks,
