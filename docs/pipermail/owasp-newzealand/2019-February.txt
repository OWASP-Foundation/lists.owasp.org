Good morning--

This is a final reminder about OWASP New Zealand Day training classes,
which are taking place on Thursday, 21 February.

Registration for these classes will close at midnight tomorrow, 14
February, so this is your last chance to take part.

The Threat Modelling class is currently sold out, with a waiting list, but
spaces are still available in the remaining two classes:

   - *Real-World Penetration Testing* (full-day): Presented by Pentester
   Academy - due to problems obtaining travel visas, the trainers will be
   presenting remotely, with in-class assistance from conference volunteers.
   - *Are You a Secure Code Warrior? *(half-day) - Presented by Secure Code
   Warrior

To register, please visit EventBrite: http://owaspnz2019.eventbrite.com

Good afternoon, all--

OWASP New Zealand Day 2019 is just three days away!

We have 22 talks scheduled, in two parallel tracks, which we hope will make
for a great day of learning and networking for the New Zealand AppSec
community.

If you haven't already done so, get in quick...there are just 35 tickets
left. Registration site: https://owaspnz2019.eventbrite.com
