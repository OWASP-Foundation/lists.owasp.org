<PRE>Hi everyone,

It's time for another OWASP meeting, just before Kiwicon III.

This time we are going to setup a video conference between Auckland
and Wellington.

A note for people in Auckland: the meeting will be held at
Security-Assessment.com offices at 12-16 Nicholls Lane, Parnell.

The meeting will be held at 6.30 pm on the 10th November.

Please confirm your attendance by only replying to myself at robertosl
(at) owasp.org with your first name
and last name.

Wellington people: location remains the same as the previous one and
please reserve your attendance as well.

Blair Strang and Scott Bell are your contacts.

Contact details below:

(Blair Strang 021 229 7231, Scott Bell 021 045 6672).

==================================

Speakers will be Nick Freeman, Security Consultant from
Security-Assessment.com and Quintin Russ, Technical Director @
SiteHost.

Nick will be speaking about AMF/Flex security testing. Here is the abstract:

&quot;There aren't a great number of AMF/Flex implementations, but if you
haven't seen them before, you're gonna have problems when testing
them. Problems like headaches and sore eyes from looking at lots of
hex.

And pretty much every AMF/Flex implementation I've seen has serious
problems of its own. Reliance on security by obscurity means that
these apps are often very pwnable, suffering from problems like SQL
injection which most developers learnt the error of years ago.
So come along and hopefully I will provide solutions to your problems.
I will be presenting on testing Flash applications - specifically
those using Flex and AMF (Action Message Format).&quot;

Quintin will be giving a preview of his Kiwicon III talk &quot;Shared
Ownership&quot;, from a web security perspective.

&quot;Shared hosting&quot; is a fairly generic term used to describe hosting
multiple websites, often (but not always) running as a unique system
user on a single virtual or physical machine. They are often poorly set
up, and almost always host vulnerable versions of software.

We'll cover some widely known flaws that exist with a quick demo showing the
risks associated with using a shared service like Shared Hosting.

==================================

Food and drinks will be provided as usual.
