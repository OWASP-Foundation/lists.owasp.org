Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] OWASP New Zealand Day - Now Accepting Diversity
	Fund Applications
Message-ID: <CAPWan0Qw7_JuTs2=_VM+1fJU6q8vC2s8fV1VkdRw2N0r1VriQg@mail.gmail.com>

Now that we have secured sufficient sponsor funding, we are finally able to
open applications for support through the OWASP New Zealand Day's Diversity
and Financial Aid Fund.

If you are planning to, or would like to, attend the conference on 22
February, but need assistance with travel to and/or accommodation in
Auckland, you can submit an application for support. Funding is biased
toward, but not exclusively for, diverse and student applicants.

Due to the limited funding available, support can be provided only for
travel within New Zealand. If you are travelling from outside New Zealand,
the available assistance is limited to accommodation and airport taxis.

Apply here: https://goo.gl/forms/zZcK0TaFiGrnMWKF3. Information provided
will be kept in strict confidence.

Please pass this information on to others who may be interested. The first
round of reviews will be completed by 29 January.

Thank you--
      John D.
