<PRE>Hi everyone,

This is a reminder for those who would like to join us this evening at
the OWASP meeting.

We are also really glad to announce that we have another speaker at the
meeting this evening. Mark Piper, senior security consultant from
Wellington will be presenting &quot;On the job browser exploitation&quot;.

OWASP DVD will also be distributed. The DVD contains all the materials
from the recent OWASP Global Security Week conference. A copy of the
entire OWASP website is part of the package as well. So feel free to
grab a copy! ;)

Level 1, 12 Queen Street, Auckland.

Please note that this is the same location of the first meeting. An
indication will be placed in front of the main door of the Britomart
building as well. Please enter the building from Queen Street side.
