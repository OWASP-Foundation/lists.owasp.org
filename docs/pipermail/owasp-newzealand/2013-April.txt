Subject: [Owasp-New_Zealand] OWASP New Zealand Chapter Meeting - Wednesday
	22 May, 2012

Hi all,

It's been a while, but OWASP New Zealand is now back in action and we have
a chapter meeting coming up. Please add it to your calendars:


When : Wednesday 22 May, 6.30PM
Where:

Auckland
---
Dimension Data
48 Market Place (Contact Energy building, opposite O'Hagans)
Site contact: Nick Freeman (021 424 777 / nick.freeman at owasp.org)

Wellington
---
Dimension Data House, Level 1, 99-105 Customhouse Quay.
Site contact: Adrian Hayes (027 442 9632 / adrian.hayes at owasp.org)


We have moved to Meetup for RSVPs as it is easier to manage than two
separate mailboxes. All future meeting announcements will be via Meetup and
this mailing list. Please find our Meetup event here:
http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-New-Zealand-Chapter/events/115108982/

As with previous meetings, venue, food and drink will be provided courtesy
of our sponsors, Security-Assessment.com and TouchPoint.

We will also for the first time be offering webcasting for this meeting -
so those of you who are unable to make it (or who are in a city that isn't
Auckland/Wellington) can now join in to meetings. Details regarding this
will be available closer to the time.

At this stage we have no presentations planned, so if you have something
you'd like to talk about, please let us know. Your talk doesn't need to be
any specific length, as long as it is related to web & application
security, we're keen to hear your idea!


Please contact myself or Adrian with any questions.

Regards
Nick Freeman & Adrian Hayes
OWASP New Zealand Chapter Leaders
