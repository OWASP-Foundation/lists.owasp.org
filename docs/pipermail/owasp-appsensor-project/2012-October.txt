There is no change password function in AppSensor, you might be
thinking of ESAPI. In that case, ESAPI's default is to use a file
based authentication scheme where the user "data store" is a file on
disk. However, most people who actually use ESAPI build their own
authenticator for a given database or ldap or something, and then use
that as their backing data store.

Thanks,
John

Hi Leaders,

In terms of transparency you can see a link to the funding situation
for the projects undergoing the reboot.

thanks,

Dear Reboot 2012 Project Leaders,

As some of you may know, Eoin, Kate and I have been working hard to
get funding for OWASP's Reboot 2012 projects. We have come to a point
in our management efforts where we are in need of a status update from
each of the project leaders participating in Reboot 2012.

I would like to ask if all of you could provide us with a status
update for your project. The information we need is outlined below:

? Progress to Date.
? Funds you have spent: Please see the Reboot 2012 Budget document and
update your expenses there.
? Roadblocks you have encountered.
? Project Leader Availability to complete the Project: A yes or a no
will suffice.

The Reboot 2012 Budget spreadsheet will help us make sure we don't
overspend our awarded funds so please do update your relevant sections
accordingly.

As Eoin has suggested before, this is in no way a micro-management
effort. We just need to know if you are still able to complete the
project proposed to Reboot 2012, and if we can assist you in
eliminating any obstacles you may have encountered. We are here to
help, after all.

Thank you all for your assistance with this endeavour, and we look
forward to your updates.

AppSensor Team & OWASP Leaders,

Just over 4 years ago I created the AppSensor project as part of OWASP's
Summer of Code.  Since then, the project has amassed a talented volunteer
core, developed into a book, built a sample implementation, multiple
guides, been the topic for academic research projects and even participated
in the Google summer of code.  We've discussed the project around the world
at conferences, with corporations with governments and more.  We've even
been published in the Journal of Defense Crosstalk magazine (
http://www.crosstalkonline.org/issues/septoct-2011.html) and are featured
on the Department of Homeland Security's website for building resilient
software (https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/swa/resilient.html).

It's been a great ride to say the least.  Many thanks to all of our
contributors with a special shout out to Colin Watson, John Melton and
Dennis Groves.

Letting go of a project like this is always tough. But it's what is best
for the long term success of the AppSensor project.  As many project
creators know, you don't want to walk away entirely and disappear from the
project.  I propose the idea of a "Project Founder" status for OWASP
projects.  I'll continue to be involved, volunteer and advise, but the
direction forward will be built and led by our next AppSensor Project
Leader.

At this point it's time to set it free and let it grow.  Effective today,
I'm opening up the project for nominations for our next AppSensor project
leader. This individual will shepherd the project, be the go-to for key
items and will build and drive the project's roadmap.  They won't be alone
of course - our whole AppSensor team is still here of course! But the
project leader will be a huge voice and driver for the overall success of
AppSensor.


I look forward to seeing what happens next. Thanks again for all those that
have helped bring AppSensor to where it is today and I hope we can all
continue to drive it forward.

"Reins" not "Reigns" !!

I want to be the first to nominate Mayor Bloomberg. I've heard he now can
write "Hello world" in Javascript and he's rich too. (So maybe we wouldn't
need that Project Reboot $$.)

Seriously, Colin, John, & Dennis would all make excellent choices and I'd
be glad to work with any of them.

And BTW, sorry to see you step down.

It's been an honor being able to work with all of you.

Michael,

It is always nerve racking to see a project founder take a public step
back.

However, I certainly understand being over committed - and I sincerely hope
that is the main driver behind your actions. I too believe we should have
"project founders"; and it is fitting for AppSensor to be the first project
to instantiate this practice.

It has been amazing to work with you; on what I believe is such a
fundamental development pattern; that I believe it will one day be 'common
practice.'

I feel honored to have my name mentioned in the same company as Colin
Watson, John Melton and Michael Coates. Thank you for allowing me to
participate and contribute; on such a great project with such great
individuals.

It has been an pleasure to work with you Michael, and a great deal of fun,
I hope we have the opportunity to do so again.

I wish you all the best Michael, in your future endeavors;

I agree with Dennis' sentiments. Michael has done a great job coming up
with the AppSensor concept and leading the project. AppSensor will miss his
skills, but giving up being leader, doesn't necessarily mean you stop
participating.

Just in case there is any more fishing going on, I do not have time or
desire to be a leader of this project, and I think there are better people
for that. I want to continue as a contributor though (and intend to do some
more work on the v2 book soon!).

Hello All,

I currently have the time, and I believe strongly in
voluntaryism<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntaryism>.


However as I have not developed software in over a decade professionally,
and my relationship with code is really code-review, compile, and run. As
for architecture and research I am strong. Indeed I have some ideas, tons
of ideas - they come to me very easily. So I am always good for a sounding
board and I hope an injection of a tangential but fresh point of view. So,
my leadership can really only extend to the project management and perhaps
setting the vision; but then perhaps this is all that is required?

If everybody agree's, then this is my toe in the door for nomination.

Dennis

I'll second (or third/fourth) the thanks for Michael - he's done a great
job.

I'll throw my name in the project leader hat with Dennis. I've been working
on the project for a while, and am currently working on the next version of
the appsensor code portion of the project. Seems like it would be a fun
challenge.

Thanks,
John

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] I need help with the detection of the
	cookie modification
Message-ID: <5089336C.5090404@gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm looking to find a way to detect the modification of a cookie in a 
webapp,

as I saw in https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_DetectionPoints

it is the SE1 but I can't find a propriate function.

As I read here 
http://www.jarvana.com/jarvana/view/org/owasp/appsensor/AppSensor/0.1.3/AppSensor-0.1.3-javadoc.jar!/index.html?org/owasp/appsensor/ASObjFactory.html

the verifyCookiesPresent is for finding if a cookie is added or deleted, 
not if it modified.


Is there any advice on how I can detect the modifications of a cookie?

Message-ID: <CAOPE6Pi4rxadZxUZTdiEJ5wFZ4xa25kWFmxCgAwn9iyCL8e+Xw@mail.gmail.com>

I think how you would do that would depending on what cookie it was.
For any other cookie other than the "session" cookie (e.g., JSESSIONID,
ASPSESSIONID, etc.), you could store the original value of the session
in the associated HTTP session object and whenever you receive it,
compare it to what you have there.

If it is something like JSESSIONID though, storing it there won't work.
I'd recommend trying to detect something like that using a JavaEE
servlet filter or (in IIS, an HTTPModule).

Of course, you could always make the tampering self-evident by
adding an HMAC to it and then validate the HMAC whenever you
validate the cookies' value. That would be the best approach, but
if you are dealing with cookies from 3rd party libraries / applications
you may not be able to do that.

Hope that makes sense.

Thank you very much Kevin,

Actually I was wondering if there was an easiest way to do that.

For example if I want to detect an sql injection attack I could use the 
|||AttackDetectorUtils.verifySQLInjectionAttack(myString);|

and I thought that it was possible to exist a similar function for a 
cookie modification.

So A general question if there isn't any detection point function under 
the |||AttackDetectorUtils I should write my own?|

Not that I'm aware, but I will defer to John Melton or someone else on this
who knows the details of the AppSensor code much better than I.

I guess that depends on how useful you think it would be. When want
to prohibit tampering of a cookie, I use something like the HMAC approach
that I described to just flat out prevent it in the first place.

Sorry - I missed this one.

No, there is no current general purpose method for detecting cookie
modification. The AttackDetectorUtils class is where the current
detection points are generally covered. If you'd like to build
something general purpose and contribute it, that'd be great. For lots
of detection points, we've found they are going to be application
specific, so we don't add example code for them. I'd also recommend
Kevin's HMAC approach as it's going to be reliable and fairly simple
and clean. Other cookie modification detection approaches add
complexity by trying to be clever.

Thanks,
John

Another 5am, another all nighter. And, I think the results are worth
sharing. Your thoughts are most appreciated.
