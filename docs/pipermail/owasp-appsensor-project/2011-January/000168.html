<PRE>Hi all

I came across the &quot;Global Security Challenge&quot; website:

   <A HREF="http://globalsecuritychallenge.com">http://globalsecuritychallenge.com</A>
   <A HREF="http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/gsc_about.php">http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/gsc_about.php</A>

They have a current worldwide competition &quot;IFSEC Future of Security
Competition 2011 for &quot;seeking technological innovations that can be
used to prevent, defend against, recover from or cope with any kind of
terrorist incidents or other criminal acts&quot;.

   <A HREF="http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/blog_detail.php?id=365">http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/blog_detail.php?id=365</A>
   <A HREF="http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/gsc_competitions.php#ifsec">http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/gsc_competitions.php#ifsec</A>

They say &quot;This newly launched annual competition aims to find the next
generation security innovations.  We aim to challenge the brightest
minds in security technology from around the world to submit radically
new ideas and game-changing technologies. The competition aims to
uncover the creative capabilities of innovators in universities and
small to medium sized enterprises that apply to security needs.&quot; and
&quot;This competition brings together the world&#8217;s most promising
technological innovations at IFSEC 2011 who will compete against each
other in a live judging session. This is a unique opportunity for the
chosen entrepreneurs to find capital, industry partners and government
customers.&quot;

I just wondered whether we ought to submit AppSensor, with the aim to
raise $10,000 towards, for example, developing ESAPI code and
demonstrators e.g. ESAPI Swingset?  It would raise awareness, even if
we didn't win.

I'd be happy to draft some answers (see application questions below),
if others on here are willing to participate?  Deadline 31 Jan 2011,
finalists announced after 28 Feb, with final judging (incl live pitch)
mid-May in Birmingham (UK?).
