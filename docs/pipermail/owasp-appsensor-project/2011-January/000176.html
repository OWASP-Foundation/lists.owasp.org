<PRE>John:

&gt;<i> Colin, Yep, that's exactly what I was thinking of.
</I>
Okay, I'll write that up.


Everyone:

Regarding &quot;approval&quot; for our application, I've put together a draft
email for the Global Projects Committee:

------------------------------------
Brad, Jason and Tom

Contributors to the AppSensor Project are hoping to apply for some
project funding to the &quot;Global Security Challenge&quot;:

  <A HREF="http://globalsecuritychallenge.com">http://globalsecuritychallenge.com</A>
  <A HREF="http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/gsc_about.php">http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/gsc_about.php</A>

The GSC has a current worldwide competition &quot;IFSEC Future of Security
Competition 2011 for &quot;seeking technological innovations that can be
used to prevent, defend against, recover from or cope with any kind of
terrorist incidents or other criminal acts&quot;.

  <A HREF="http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/blog_detail.php?id=365">http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/blog_detail.php?id=365</A>
  <A HREF="http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/gsc_competitions.php#ifsec">http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/gsc_competitions.php#ifsec</A>

It doesn't cost anything to enter.  We have begun a draft of text for
the application at:

  <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_GSS_IFSEC_2011">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_GSS_IFSEC_2011</A>

but would like to run the idea past the Global Projects Committee.
Unfortunately, we only came across this idea just over a week ago, and
the deadline for this particular competition is the 31st January 2011.
 The ideas of what we'd plan to use the possible $10,000 award are
shown on the draft wiki page (still under discussion on the AppSensor
mailing list), but essentially is more coding (for ESAPI integration)
and documentation, rather like the outputs from the Summer of Code
2008.

Our view is that all the award would be used to &quot;pay&quot; for work on the
project, i.e. no contribution to OWASP overheads, and that it would be
run in the same way as other funded OWASP projects, with reviews and
the like.  It's just that these would be supported by an award - there
seem to have been other &quot;sponsored&quot; projects in the past I think?

As to who would do the work... we think that should be open to
competitive bids to produce the required release quality deliverables,
or fixed prices for certain deliverables and compare alternative bids
based on reputation and what else they offer?  Clearly there are
potential people already involved in the project who may want to bid,
but it should be open to apply in the usual way.

Have you had to deal with anything like this previously?

We'd welcome your input, questions, etc.
------------------------------------


Is this okay?  How about the bit about how the money would be used and
how people would be selected to do the work?

Colin
