<PRE>Dinis,
Very cool - thanks for sharing. This will help shape some of the ideas
going into V2. Very nice work.

Thanks,
John

&gt;<i> Hi AppSensor list
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I sent the email below to the OWASP leaders list. Since all of you are
</I>&gt;<i> interested in AppSensor and security, here is a copy for the ones who
</I>&gt;<i> didn't received it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
</I>&gt;<i> ----------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see on Please hack TeamMentor 3.4.1 (learn, maybe be paid or
</I>&gt;<i> even get a job)&lt;<A HREF="http://blog.diniscruz.com/2014/05/please-hack-teammentor-341-learn-maybe.html">http://blog.diniscruz.com/2014/05/please-hack-teammentor-341-learn-maybe.html</A>&gt; I'm
</I>&gt;<i> inviting the world to hack the app I'm been working for the past years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can either do a pure black-box (on
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://tm-appsensor.azurewebsites.net">https://tm-appsensor.azurewebsites.net</A> ) or look at the source code
</I>&gt;<i> (clone from <A HREF="https://github.com/TeamMentor/Dev">https://github.com/TeamMentor/Dev</A> and run locally or in Azure
</I>&gt;<i> (only needs .NET 4.0, no DB install required)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is quite a lot of OWASP influence in this release of TeamMentor,
</I>&gt;<i> from the O2 Platform FluentSharp libraries (which make me a lot more
</I>&gt;<i> productive as a developer), to the AppSensor-like features (see below) and
</I>&gt;<i> the multiple OWASP-inspired coding strategies used to keep the app secure
</I>&gt;<i> (look for example at the ASMX and WCF security tests or the .NET Security
</I>&gt;<i> Demands).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is really cool and I'm very excited about, is the first pass at
</I>&gt;<i> adding AppSensor capabilities to this app.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like I mentioned many times when talking about AppSensor, my main issue
</I>&gt;<i> with the original model was that it pushed apps to add too much behaviour
</I>&gt;<i> to the application in order be 'Appsensor-ready' (which could affect the
</I>&gt;<i> application's performance/behaviour).  My preferred approach (which I've
</I>&gt;<i> implemented now) is to first really improve the ability of an application
</I>&gt;<i> to 'report and visualise' what is going on. This is done by pushing that
</I>&gt;<i> info to 'somewhere' outside the app, then start thinking about how to
</I>&gt;<i> detect malicious activity (from the point of view of that app) and finally
</I>&gt;<i> what should be done about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the real-time data distribution (user activities, debug logs and
</I>&gt;<i> request urls) I used Firebase mapped to an AngularJS UI, which really rocks
</I>&gt;<i> (the firebase 'websockets content push' fells like magic). You can read
</I>&gt;<i> most details about it in the 7 posts at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.diniscruz.com/search/label/Firebase">http://blog.diniscruz.com/search/label/Firebase</A> and if you want to see it
</I>&gt;<i> action, create an account and let me know (i'll give you admin access to
</I>&gt;<i> that Azure box if you promise to behave :)  )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So have a go, and please share that blog post (and the server details) to
</I>&gt;<i> others who you think might be interested (note that the last guy who
</I>&gt;<i> reported a bunch of security issues with TM got a job out of it).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other area that I'm really interested in, is to have a couple threads
</I>&gt;<i> on important security topics like: Data Encoding, Authentication,
</I>&gt;<i> Authorisation, OWASP Top 10 issues, Application self-defence, Unit-Test
</I>&gt;<i> driven development (with a security focus), Continuous
</I>&gt;<i> Integration/Deployment (with security embedded in it) and
</I>&gt;<i> static-code/dynamic analysis of multi-tear webservices+jquery based apps
</I>&gt;<i> like this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those are all things I worry daily, and as you can see, SI (Security
</I>&gt;<i> Innovation) is pretty good sport at having this type of open discussion
</I>&gt;<i> about their product (which has its code available in a public GitHub
</I>&gt;<i> repository (it's not Open Source, but at least the code is all there)).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of the times we (the appsec guys/gals) are accused of talking in
</I>&gt;<i> vacuum or providing security guidance on demo/simple apps. OK, here is a
</I>&gt;<i> real-world app, with real-world complexity and compromises. Ideally OWASP
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to help developers like me and protect these apps users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know that sometimes it feels that OWASP is stuck and doesn't really
</I>&gt;<i> connect with developers, but I have to say that as a developer I benefit
</I>&gt;<i> tremendously from the knowledge shared by OWASP (for example the
</I>&gt;<i> cheat-sheets), its projects (for example AppSensor or ESAPI (from which I
</I>&gt;<i> took the 'concepts' not the code)) and chapters/conferences.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dinis
