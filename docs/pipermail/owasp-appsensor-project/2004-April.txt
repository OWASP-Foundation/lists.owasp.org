This CFP might be something that the AppSensor dev team might be
interested in submitting a paper to.

If someone writes something up, I would at least volunteer to review
it. (Unfortunately, with 2 ESAPI projects, I don't have much additional time.)

Apologies for multiple copies of this announcement.

14th International Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection
(RAID'2011)

September 20-21, 2011
SRI International, Menlo Park, CA
http://www.raid2011.org

Call for Participation

===========================================================

For the fourteenth year, the intrusion detection community will
converge at RAID'2011 to discuss cutting-edge research in malware,
application security, anomaly detection, special environments
and sandboxing, web security and social networks, and network
security. You are invited to join us at RAID for two days
this September at SRI International, Menlo Park, CA.

Register online at: http://www.raid2011.org/.
Register now!
Students scholarships are now available!

The annual symposium brings together leading researchers and
practitioners from academia, government, and industry to discuss
issues and technologies related to intrusion detection and
defense.

RAID 2011 features an exciting technical program, with
presentations addressing topics such as dynamic analysis of malicious
shellcode, world's fastest taint tracker, anomaly detection using
software defined networking, defending legacy embeded systems,
web and social network security, and cross-analysis of botnet victims.
A poster session during the symposium will provide lively
face-to-face discussions of work in progress.

This year we will have a great keynote presentation on "The
Cutting Edge of Medical Device Security and Privacy" by Dr. Kevin Fu!

We also have a special panel to discuss "State and Future of
Open-Source Network Intrusion Detection":
?Panel Moderator:
?- Ron Gula, Tenable Network Security
?Panel participants:
?- Seth Hall, International Computer Science Insitute
?- Victor Julien, Open Infosec Foundation
?- Martin Roesch, Sourcefire

The Open Information Security Foundation (OISF) is co-locating
a Suricata community meeting with RAID 2011.


Don't miss out this great fun event to socialize with your
colleagues at the heart of silicon valley!

Great find!  This would be good to attend.

Menlo park is along my normal commute. But.... this is the same time as AppSecUSA! So I actually can't attend since I'll be in there air! 

Anyone else available? I'd be happy to help out with the slide deck.
