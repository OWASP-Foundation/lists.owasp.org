Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] 2.1.0-RC2 released
Message-ID: <CAM8z=yKBDqxbV5JcbzBRjDw3L+HjO1BLMUEQ-HyPz5KbrWrmHg@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I just released 2.1.0-RC2. This is the second (and hopefully final) release
candidate for 2.1.0.  More info is here:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/releases/tag/v2.1.0-RC2

No significant changes in RC2 from RC1. The 2.1.0 major changes are here:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/blob/dev-v2.1/changelog.txt

If there are no significant issues, I'm planning a final release in mid
June.

As always, happy to hear any feedback.

Thanks,
John

Message-ID: <CAM8z=yK_iRqpCmsj4V7VumsJ193dUp2zmYoU2jVhmR_UcwyVXQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Colin collected the feedback from the mailing list about the AppSensor UI
and posted it to the mailing list (
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-appsensor-project/2015-May/000978.html
)

I took that information and built a _proposal_ for the UI - this is very
open to changes right now. The doc walks through the architecture, scope,
specific UI layouts, and technology stack.

If you're interested, please have a look and make as many comments as you'd
like, and continue the discussion on this list. I'll assume if there are no
comments, it must be right! I'll leave the discussion open for at least a
week before moving forward.

Message-ID: <CAM8z=yKFfG=-9e4ZBWkGUdeOghX0MckT69KpAPWoYdDA5EWYQQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I'm happy to announce appsensor 2.1.0 has just been released.

The release information is published here (also copied below):
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/releases/tag/v2.1.0

* Geolocation of end users now possible (optional configuration)

* Added support for RabbitMQ execution mode

* Added support for Kafka execution mode

* Added support for JMX Notification emitter

* Added support for CEF (over syslog) emitter

* Documentation updates to cover new features
  and generally enhance end/user developer documentation

* Update maven configurations to upgrade dependency
  versions and correct configuration for generating
  javadocs and maven "site"

* Added spring security integration that covers:
    - events emitted by spring security added to appsensor
    - a custom appsensor user manager
    - a custom appsensor security context repository

* Added example app to show usage in local mode with
  spring security integration

* Added example app to show the use of appsensor for
  something other than application layer IDS. In this case,
  it is being used as an exception tracker. As exceptions
  are generated, they are logged with appsensor, then a simple
  custom UI shows them in a grouped list. While the example
  is simple and contrived, a more sophisticated UI could
  allow for grouping, searching, sorting and analysis.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
John

All,
This has been open for 10 days, and I've received some good feedback both
in the doc itself as well as direct emails, so thank you very much - the
participation level has been great! I'll keep it open over the weekend, but
then will move forward after that. If you have any showstoppers, please let
me know.
Thanks,

For the "view from afar dashboard", I think some BIG NUMBERS styled
using CSS-alone would be sufficient. I have uploaded an idea:

   https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByNJ8mfWALwjTXBodHBZRlpzSE0/view?usp=sharing

This displays a trend over 5 time periods:

- last hour
- last shift (8 hours)
- last day
- last week
- last month

The numbers are the average detection events (above line), and
responses (below line), per hour in the period. Note that all periods,
include all data from the shorter periods, so that the every period is
a rolling minute-by-minute period that all include the last minute. It
needs to auto-update (every minute?). The user could select to
application or application group, or maybe it should just aggregate
everything they are assigned to. All text apart from the numbers ought
to be very small, and will not be legible from a distance. There would
not be any drill down options from this screen. Maybe these things
should be config options:

- colour RGB values of black, red, green
- percentage increase/decrease that changes the colour from black
(mock up suggests 20% more, 20% less)
- the averaging period for the numbers ("per hour" in the mock up)

Would have to cater for "display overflow", maybe by determining how
many digits there are in the rounded outputs, and set the CSS font
size to suit.

This summary info/ layout won't be suitable for many situations, but
it is a demo and people can modify it.  I could do some layout CSS in
due course.

Colin, I really like this - thanks!

I also like that this should be reasonably straightforward to build, and
seems to be really useful for its intended purpose. +1 from me.

A couple notes:
- I'll use your comments as the mouseover text and will probably add a
small "help" modal to describe the layout of the page.
- the first version will probably not have configuration setup, but I'll
add the framework to support that as I'm going.

Thanks,
John
