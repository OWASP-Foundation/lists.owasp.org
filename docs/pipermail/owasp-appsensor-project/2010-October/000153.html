<PRE>Forwarding to AppSensor mailing list.  I think John will have the most
current info for several of these questions.

But, we do need to get the appsensor.jar as a feature download.  We
don't want people to build from scratch if they don't want to.

Michael,

I just watched your AppSec USA 2010 video presentation about AppSensor &amp; ESAPI
yesterday. (Thanks for the credit as contributor BTW. Totally unexpected.)

In it, you mentioned that it was planned to have appsensor.jar bundled with
ESAPI as of ESAPI 2.0rc8. Since I don't see it in ESAPI even in 2.0rc10,
I'm guessing that there was a delay for some reason.

So then I go to look for the AppSensor tutorial and the AppSensor jar file
at the AppSensor Google Code site and I don't find either. (The tutorial is
under '/' of the trunk under the svn/trunk though, so I did get it.) But
surprisingly (to me, at least) was the fact that I could not find appsensor.jar
anywhere under the featured or previous Downloads. (Do you expect people to
build it from scratch?)

Anyway, the reason that I am bringing this up is that I am about ready to
start working on the ESAPI crypto for the 2.1 branch and I see many places
where I'd like to wire-in AppSensor detection points into either JavaEncryptor
or perhaps even EncryptionException. If AppSensor was truly bundled as part of
ESAPI that would be fairly easy to do. OTOH, if it is not, I may need to
rethink this because I don't want to create yet another dependency on an
external class library. (ESAPI already has something like 30+ jars that it
is dependent upon.)

Lastly, from your AppSec USA 2010 video, I recall you stating that that the
way that AppSensor would be enabled in ESAPI would be to set

ESAPI.IntrusionDetector=org.owasp.appsensor.intrusiondetection.AppSensorIntrusionDetector

in the ESAPI.properties file. However, I also vaguely recall discussion
as to how that property should not be used as that would disable
ESAPI's built-in WAF and I thought that I remember Jeff Williams arguing that
AppSensor and the ESAPI WAF were _complimentary_ rather than _competing_
technologies so therefore they should use different properties in ESAPI.
Anyway, I am not sure that this has been resolved or not, so would appreciate
an update in this area as well.

Thanks,
-kevin
P.S.- If you wish to reply to the OWASP-AppSensor-Project mailing list, that's
      fine as I subscribe to that. Just wasn't sure if this was to appropriate
      to ask this there as I'm not sure if that's a developers list or a users
      list.
