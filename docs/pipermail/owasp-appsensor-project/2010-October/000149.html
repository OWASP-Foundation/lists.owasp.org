<PRE>All,
For anyone interested, I just finished adding an HSQLDB implementation of
the intrusion store to the AppSensorDemo2 (
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/#svn/trunk/AppSensorDemo2">http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/#svn/trunk/AppSensorDemo2</A>)
code base.  This is a really simple implementation based on the original
in-memory version that is the default.  However, it does store all the
pertinent intrusion related data in the DB.  I'll mention up front that this
is absolutely not optimal.  I spent no real time optimizing and it will be
slow if you try it on any decent size app, but it does provide a simple
example of how it can be done.  It is also included in the demo code so I
can get away with less optimal code.  If there is a good amount of interest,
we can spend some time doing optimization, though I tend to think how this
is done will be very specific to the app/organization using appsensor.

The code's been sitting there for a few weeks, but I had to wait for ESAPI
to push their latest version that included a patch I added in order to make
the exceptions from ESAPI serializable - this simple code just serializes
the actual exception objects to the DB as opposed to parsing out all the
data, then trying to reconstruct exceptions.

The last thing is that I updated the maven POM from the core code to point
to the latest version of ESAPI, which thanks to the ESAPI team is now in the
central maven repo.  Now there should be no manual adding of ESAPI to your
local maven repo.  You should just be able to pull the appsensor source and
build directly.  I'll try to update the online build docs soon with the
revised info.
Thanks,
John
