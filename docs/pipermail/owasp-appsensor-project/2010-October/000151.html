<PRE>Colin,
That would be fine.  Just ping me offline about when you'd like to chat.
I've tried to give a short answer to each of your questions listed below for
the benefit of those on the list.
Thanks,
John

</I>&gt;<i> This sounds very useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could I maybe have a telephone/VOIP chat with you in a week or so's
</I>&gt;<i> time?  I'm writing a code/language agnostic guidance about a method of
</I>&gt;<i> selecting detection points and response actions (things to consider,
</I>&gt;<i> how detection points relate top other taxonomies, etc).  One chart
</I>&gt;<i> (work in progress attached, which tries to show how some detection
</I>&gt;<i> points are a more general version of another detection point).   It is
</I>&gt;<i> aimed at perhaps a less developer-orientated audience, and I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> understand what the ESAPI AppSensor code includes/does not include so
</I>&gt;<i> I don't drop me or anyone else in it, when asked a question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the sorts of things I'd like to ask are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - how configurable are threshold levels and time periods (per
</I>&gt;<i> application, per detection point)
</I>
per detection point

&gt;<i> - which detection points and responses are implemented (sorry about
</I>&gt;<i> adding all those extra ideas)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Most if not all of the detection points we've implemented so far are in
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/trunk/AppSensor/src/main/java/org/owasp/appsensor/AttackDetectorUtils.java">http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/trunk/AppSensor/src/main/java/org/owasp/appsensor/AttackDetectorUtils.java</A>
As far as response actions - those are listed in
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/trunk/AppSensor/src/main/java/org/owasp/appsensor/intrusiondetection/reference/DefaultResponseAction.java">http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/trunk/AppSensor/src/main/java/org/owasp/appsensor/intrusiondetection/reference/DefaultResponseAction.java</A>
the current list is [log, logout, disable, disableComponent,
disableComponentForUser, smsAdmin, emailAdmin]

&gt;<i> - are the trend exceptions handled differently
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>trend exceptions are handled differently.  This is currently a weak area
where not much time has been spent working through these issues.  There is
some very basic code in the core project for trend monitoring, and a bit of
code in the demo that exercises it -
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/trunk/AppSensorDemo2/src/org/owasp/appsensor/demoapp/#demoapp/trend.">http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/trunk/AppSensorDemo2/src/org/owasp/appsensor/demoapp/#demoapp/trend.</A>
This will be an area of increased effort going forward.  This is going to be
more complicated than the base functionality of threshold monitoring.

&gt;<i> - how are the detection points that accumulate events (e.g. multiple
</I>&gt;<i> failed passwords, large number of file uploads) implemented, if at all
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If I understand the question, this is the core of appsensor.  An error state
occurs, and the code creates an exception.  Part of the exception
declaration includes the identifier code (IE1, STE1, etc).  The intrusion
store differentiates between these exceptions.  When a new exception is
created, the intrusion store checks if X number of that specific intrusion
have occurred over Y amount of time, and if so, triggers a response.  The
core detection/response code is there and working.  As for the detection of
the 2 specific events you mentioned, I don't think those are implemented at
all from a detection standpoint.

&gt;<i> - etc
