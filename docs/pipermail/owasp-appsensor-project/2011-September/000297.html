The meeting notes are here:

   <A HREF="http://etherpad.mozilla.org:9000/AppSensor">http://etherpad.mozilla.org:9000/AppSensor</A>

To summarise a little, the idea is to separate out the analytical
engine (Java, with possibly .NET and now PHP versions), and provide
some sort of common API to send data, and receive intelligence back,
allowing the applications to do the API calls and related logic
however they want.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was good to meet all of you at AppSecUSA. I have been looking for ways to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to this project and came up with some ideas.&#160; I wanted to run
</I>&gt;<i> them by you all to see if I am on track with what you guys feel should be
</I>&gt;<i> the direction of AppSensor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great to meet you too - glad you're plugging in - we LOVE the help!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Background:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During the summit it was proposed that the Intrusion Detection Analysis
</I>&gt;<i> Engine (not sure what it is called) would be separated out as a separate
</I>&gt;<i> process, but kept in Java.&#160; Then the code that implements the detection
</I>&gt;<i> points and response actions could be written in Java, .Net, PHP and so on to
</I>&gt;<i> interface with this engine I imagine via some form of inter-process
</I>&gt;<i> communication.&#160; I offered to write some initial detection-point PHP code as
</I>&gt;<i> a test that would allow developers to insert detection points and echo any
</I>&gt;<i> detections back to the screen (or to a file, or to syslog, since PHP already
</I>&gt;<i> has syslog integration) as a first pass until John was able to start on the
</I>&gt;<i> next gen Engine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and we're stoked about that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some Thoughts, Observations and Questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The current AppSensor was designed to play well with ESAPI.&#160; Based on the
</I>&gt;<i> very little I know about ESAPI, I would imagine that the detection-point
</I>&gt;<i> code should continue to depend on ESAPI.&#160; Would the Engine also have to be
</I>&gt;<i> dependent on ESAPI?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The intrusion detector bit, yes, should probably stay at least
</I>&gt;<i> ESAPI-compliant since we want to &quot;play together well&quot; for sure. However, we
</I>&gt;<i> will also likely provide non-esapi hooks for the client in case someone is
</I>&gt;<i> anti-esapi for some reason, or just can't doesn't want to bring it in, and
</I>&gt;<i> that version should still talk to the engine just fine. The engine component
</I>&gt;<i> certainly does not HAVE to use ESAPI at all. We'll make that determination
</I>&gt;<i> during the design, and will use it only if it makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I was going through some of the current AppSensor/ESAPI Java code, and
</I>&gt;<i> also looking at the ESAPI PHP code and noticed that the Java version used a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;.properties&quot; format for the config, but the PHP ESAPI used an XML config
</I>&gt;<i> file.&#160; Based on this, I will probably use an XML config file for any
</I>&gt;<i> AppSensor-specific configs for the detection-point code.&#160; However, it should
</I>&gt;<i> be trivial to fall back to a &quot;.properties&quot; file format if need be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is DEFINITELY up in the air for me at the moment. I want to hear what
</I>&gt;<i> the ESAPI folks are doing here, and will probably stay with that. I know
</I>&gt;<i> we're a different project, but we are going for &quot;drop in&quot; replacement and
</I>&gt;<i> changing our config files does not make us drop in. Having said that, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know the status on the PHP side for ESAPI. For now, go w/ XML as you
</I>&gt;<i> said and just build some abstraction like we discussed so you can swap in a
</I>&gt;<i> properties file reader if necessary
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Assuming you all are comfortable with the PHP I submit, and it makes
</I>&gt;<i> sense to release it, I can also update the wiki with example snippets of PHP
</I>&gt;<i> code in the section on detection points.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would be awesome. Ping me the code and I'll give it a quick review for
</I>&gt;<i> you. The wiki editing you can do yourself. Michael can set you up if you
</I>&gt;<i> don't have write access.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts?
