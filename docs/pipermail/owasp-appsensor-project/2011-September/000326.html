<PRE>Here is a great
example&lt;<A HREF="http://ceres.ugr.es/~gmacia/papers/COMSEC09_AnidsPublishedVersion.pdf">http://ceres.ugr.es/~gmacia/papers/COMSEC09_AnidsPublishedVersion.pdf</A>&gt;from
2008 about A-NIDS or Anomaly Based Network Intrusions Detection
Systems.

*Pay attention to figure 1 on page 19 and figure 3 on page 20. *

There are some very enlightening patterns to learn from within the attached
document. And this leads to a number of questions we can ask ourselves. For
example should we be building 3 types of rule-engines as they have on page
20; statistical, knowledge based and machine learning based?

Right now we have done a lot of work on the knowledge based (detection
points), because of our tacit knowledge of web application security issues.
And we have recently been discussing the statistical models. However, there
is certainly room in our design for 'machine learning' - particularly since
we are splitting the 'rules engine out' - and in doing so; will be able to
more easily accommodate such expansions of capability. In doing so we start
to really define a 'self healing' and adaptive behaviour for Applications,
darwinian security if you will, and I think that is very, very cutting edge
and exciting.
