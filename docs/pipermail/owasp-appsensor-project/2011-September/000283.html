<PRE>Chaps,

I'm plumbing in AppSensor and currently switching out elements (such as the
IntrusionStore) for more persistent implementations (eg a
MembaseIntrusionStore etc).

The only place I've come unstuck is the AppSensorServiceController
implementation that's used behind AppSensorRequestBlockingFilter. The
service and perUser service stores are static Hashtables, ideally I'd switch
those out for MemBase or whatever so they don't just apply to the current
node, they apply across all distributed nodes. But I can't see how without
writing my own filter, service controller and response actions. The code
would largely be a clone or your defaults, give or take, which seems a shame
when it's so close. This would be made easier if some of the action methods
in DefaultResponseAction were protected; then I could just override the
disableComponent* methods and wire them into my service controller and
filter.

Perhaps an AppSensorServiceStore in a similar pattern to the IntrustionStore
could be employed? Then I could use it pretty much as is.



Luke



PS  - thanks for a great product, it integrates pretty well into Jersey
JAX-RS using a custom ExceptionMapper.
