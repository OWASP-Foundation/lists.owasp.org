<PRE>All,

It's been pointed out to me that getting a logo (while easier) is still not
always possible. To that end, if you'd like to share an anonymous story
(preferably with your industry vertical at least) about what you're doing
with appsensor (very generic), that would also be really helpful. Something
like :

&quot;Company in Aviation industry used AppSensor for the purpose of ...... and
they gained benefits of ...... etc.&quot;

If you think that would be a better route for your organization, let me
know, and we can add those types of references.

Thanks,
John
