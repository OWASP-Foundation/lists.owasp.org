<PRE>Jim,

You've been a great benefactor of the project - thank you. You've asked
this question a couple of times, and I've never really had a good answer. I
thought I'd spend a bit of time coming up with a few ideas (in order of
what popped in my head first). Many/all of these could apply to various
owasp projects, not just appsensor.

- *a platform for funding pull requests / contributions to projects* - this
could be a way to financially reward folks for contributing. I know ZAP
recently experimented with this - not sure how it went, but we have money -
might be a good way to spend it (maybe leveraging something like the bithub
idea <A HREF="https://whispersystems.org/blog/bithub/">https://whispersystems.org/blog/bithub/</A>). I would want the ability to
personally remove myself from the ability of receiving payment.

- *help with applying for grants* - including letting us know of available
grants and helping us do the paperwork if necessary

- *make inter-project recommendations* - since you sit at a level where you
see various projects, maybe make recommendations for areas where multiple
projects could collaborate for added value

- *project of the month* - this may already happen, but if not, maybe the
newsletter could feature a project every month, including information like
a project overview, an audio interview with the project leader(s), a list
of priority tasks for people to help with, etc.

- *get access to available free tools* - I've actually seen several tools
that are available for use within OWASP, though I hear about them
haphazardly. It would be good if there were a single resource for leads to
know what was available. Thinking of things like: free licenses of paid
software (intellij, webex) or access to products/services (surveymonkey,
AWS, GCE or Azure credits) that could be useful to the project

- *conducting surveys* - We do surveys periodically, and I fill them out.
Joanna has used them to good effect. We might be able to make that more
regular and get good data on our projects.

- *&quot;help wanted&quot; site* - We use github issues on our project. However, one
thing I hear repeatedly is project leaders saying they need help, and owasp
members asking how to help. It seems like we could put up a &quot;jobs&quot; board of
some kind to connect folks within the community for things like this. We
could probably connect this to $ in some way if we wanted to. I imagine
there's a tool out there that already does this too.

- *continue and expand &quot;summer of code&quot; programs* - I believe these
programs add lots of value. Not only do they get practical things done on
the projects, but they give us good visibility, get people involved in the
projects (many continue to contribute), give us good press in the
community, and invigorate the mentors as well.

Anyone else - please feel free to contribute other ideas.

Thanks,
John

</I>&gt;<i> All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wanted to pass along the latest info about the code portion of the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - We have as of late gotten a number of folks helping on the project
</I>&gt;<i> (YAY!) and a number of folks talking about how they are actually using the
</I>&gt;<i> project (separate email forthcoming).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - We've got work going on dockerizing portions of the project. (thanks
</I>&gt;<i> Zach)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - We've got testing going on for using SQL server as a JPA data store.
</I>&gt;<i> (thanks Ashish)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - We now have documentation for both emitting to the ELK stack and
</I>&gt;<i> influx-db/grafana done as well as an influx-db emitter built (thanks
</I>&gt;<i> Sumanth) (thanks owasp summer of code)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - We have a student who is doing a senior project on AppSensor and will be
</I>&gt;<i> extending the capabilities of our analysis engines. (thanks Kelvin)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - We just added a new way of handling &quot;block&quot; (disable component)
</I>&gt;<i> requests. There is now an emitter as well as a reverse proxy you can use to
</I>&gt;<i> implement request blocking. We're looking at extending this model to handle
</I>&gt;<i> more capabilities &quot;out of the box&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - We have several more folks who are looking at ways of contributing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - I'm doing some documentation work to try and simplify the workflow for
</I>&gt;<i> people just getting started with the project
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - I gave a talk on appsensor 2.0 at appsecusa and shared a bit about where
</I>&gt;<i> we are with the project and where we're going (slides

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see, it's been a busy past few months. Lots going on in the
</I>&gt;<i> project right now. Feel free to jump in and help. There are MANY ways to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute, so don't hesitate. If you have ideas about how to get folks to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute, I'd love to hear those.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As always, let me know if you have any questions.
