<PRE>All,

I've done a few appsensor presentations in the last 2 months. In talking
with folks afterwards, I've had at least a dozen people mention they are
actually using appsensor in production (awesome!).

We used to have a hard time getting folks to share that info with us, but
it seems much easier now. Given that, I'd like to start a logo page/section
on appsensor.org, something like a &quot;These companies are already using
AppSensor&quot;.

I want to be very clear on this issue: OWASP is vendor-neutral, and as
such, we won't be recommending/marketing anyone's products - at all.
However, when evaluating software, most people don't want to be the first
one trying to use something. To that end, I think it'd be useful to show
who is already using the product so folks can have a level of trust in the
tool.

If you're using appsensor, and would be willing to share that with the
world, send me your information. If you'd like to give a quote about your
experience (testimonial), send me that too, and I'll try to incorporate
those as well.

I'm very proud of what this community has built, and I want to see it
continue to grow. Hoping this will help in some small way.

As always, let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
John
