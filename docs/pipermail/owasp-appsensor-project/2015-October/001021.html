<PRE>All,

Wanted to pass along the latest info about the code portion of the project.

- We have as of late gotten a number of folks helping on the project (YAY!)
and a number of folks talking about how they are actually using the project
(separate email forthcoming).

- We've got work going on dockerizing portions of the project. (thanks Zach)

- We've got testing going on for using SQL server as a JPA data store.
(thanks Ashish)

- We now have documentation for both emitting to the ELK stack and
influx-db/grafana done as well as an influx-db emitter built (thanks
Sumanth) (thanks owasp summer of code)

- We have a student who is doing a senior project on AppSensor and will be
extending the capabilities of our analysis engines. (thanks Kelvin)

- We just added a new way of handling &quot;block&quot; (disable component) requests.
There is now an emitter as well as a reverse proxy you can use to implement
request blocking. We're looking at extending this model to handle more
capabilities &quot;out of the box&quot;.

- We have several more folks who are looking at ways of contributing

- I'm doing some documentation work to try and simplify the workflow for
people just getting started with the project

- I gave a talk on appsensor 2.0 at appsecusa and shared a bit about where
we are with the project and where we're going (slides

(video <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1imlD1O4HrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1imlD1O4HrY</A>)

As you can see, it's been a busy past few months. Lots going on in the
project right now. Feel free to jump in and help. There are MANY ways to
contribute, so don't hesitate. If you have ideas about how to get folks to
contribute, I'd love to hear those.

As always, let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
John
