<PRE>Hello AppSensor team,

I just want to let you know that I have received word from the DHS about
your project grant proposal. I am happy to report that you have been
awarded your grant from DHS and Georgia Tech.

I will reach out with more details once I hear back from Deb from the HOST
program.

Reach out to me if you have questions.

Congratulations, AppSensor team! Very well done to all!  :-)

Sam G.

Dear Samantha,
**

Thank you again for submitting an application on OWASP's behalf during our
Open Call for Investment Applications that took place between July 2nd and
August 14, 2013. This call for investments produced twenty-eight
applications.  Four projects were selected for funding within the HOST
program, a number of others are being referred for potential funding
outside of the HOST program by DHS S&amp;T. We are notifying all applicants of
their award status today.*

*
We are pleased to inform you that your project has been selected for HOST
Investment funding. We will contact you soon to discuss the next steps in
the investment process, and work to draft an agreement, including a scope
of work between your organization and Georgia Tech Research Institute.
(Please direct your emails to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-appsensor-project">investments at opencybersecurity.org</A> email for
correspondence; someone on the team will reply.)

We have included key feedback from the peer reviewers for your information
below my signature.*
*
*
*On behalf of the HOST team, congratulations and welcome to the program. We
look forward to working with you.*
*
*
*Best Regards,*

Application: OWASP AppSensor Project (project design support)
Organization: OWASP Foundation
POC: Samantha Groves; <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-appsensor-project">samantha.groves at owasp.org</A>; 480-800-9830

Feedback:

There was general consensus among reviewers that this project is a small
investment for a valuable part of the Appsensor Project, including useful
documentation of a high quality. They also believe the software components
and method will actually be usable, and define sound practices for handling
security issues at the applications level. The reviewers also noted the
importance of OWASP and the fact that it is volunteer-driven and therefore
deserves support to remain viable.
