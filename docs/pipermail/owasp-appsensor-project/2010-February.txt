All,

The source code for an AppSensor demo project at http://DefendTheApp.com is
now available at the Google code repository.

http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/

I've uploaded all of the source and a ready to go WAR file.  There is a
quick readme on the WAR file, make sure to check that out.

Warning, this code is a quickly built demo. It may be messy :)

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) Project
	Update - Rule Tag Data Linking to AppSensor
Message-ID: <201002051619.12068.rcbarnett@gmail.com>

Greetings everyone,
I am the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) Project Leader - 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_ModSecurity_Core_Rule_Set_Project

First off, I wanted to say that I really like the AppSensor concept.  There is some logical 
overlap between what categories of issues can be identified by AppSensor locally and what 
can be identified external to the app by an intermediary WAF.  There are however also some 
categories of issues that can only be determined when you have access to internal code 
logic and data (mainly authentication/authorization types of issues).  I also like some of 
the more behavioral detection capabilities that are presented to identify abnormal spikes 
in app usage.  I am planning to put some research into how some of this logic can be 
implemented in ModSecurity using the Lua API.

Anyways, onto my main point for this email.  While the CRS doesn't cover all of the 
detection category items in AppSensor, it does include some of them.  I have just released 
v2.0.5 of the CRS and in it, I have included additional TAG data referencing the 
corresponding AppSensor sections.  This data is presented to the user in the logs when 
rules trigger.  Here is an example when someone sends the DELETE request method, which is 
not allowed by default policy -

Message: Match of "within %{tx.allowed_methods}" against "REQUEST_METHOD" required. [file 
"/usr/local/apache/conf/modsec_current/base_rules/modsecurity_crs_30_http_policy.conf"] 
[line "30"] [id "960032"] [msg "Method is not allowed by policy"] [data "DELETE"] 
[severity "CRITICAL"] [tag "POLICY/METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED"] [tag "WASCTC/WASC-15"] [tag 
"OWASP_TOP_10/A6"] [tag "OWASP_AppSensor/RE1"] [tag "PCI/12.1"]

Notice that the the TAG data references AppSensor section RE1.

Anyways, I just wanted to share this info and say keep up the great work!

Cheers.

Ryan,

This is great news. We are happy to be linked together with the ModSecurity
project.  Would you be willing to share you mappings? We will soon be
expanding the information provided for each detection point and would also
like to cross reference mapping information just as you have done.

Also, let's talk and see how these two projects can continue to work
together.

Thanks,

Michael,
Had a chance to briefly go over the code last night.  As you mentioned, a
bit rough around the edges, but it really helped crystallize some of the
ideas - excellent! Thanks for posting.  Like I mentioned last week on list,
I can help out some, w/ some coding, or updating the wiki w/ the matrix we
discussed, etc.  If you can use the help, let me know where you think the
best place to start is, and how to go about doing so (if I need accounts,
etc).

Thanks,
John

Great!  Glad you were able to take a look and that it provided some value :)

I think our first target area should be to get the detection points on the
wiki. I'd like each detection point to have its on wiki page that follows a
standard format. This will include an area for sample code for the detection
point.  The other thing that would be awesome would be reusable code for the
management of the events themselves.  As you saw in my demo, I integrated
with ESAPI and created three or four extra classes to keep track of
everything.  Could you come up with a better/cleaner approach and code that
we can provide as part of the project (feel free to intergrate with ESAPI or
not, whatever makes sense)?

I'd like to be able to advertise the following about AppSensor
1. This is what we think you should be doing - This is the AppSensor
document we currently have
2. This is one way you can make this happen - This would be the event
management code you create plus our examples of detection points in code
that work with that management code.

Ideally we would eventually have AppSensorDemo v2 which would use this new
code and be a much cleaner example for developers to reference.


What do you think? Want to take a shot at item 2 while I work on getting the
detection points into the wiki?

Thanks,

All,

I decided to move the detection points into the Wiki. There are a few
reasons for this.

1. I'd like to enable those with ideas to directly make changes. The current
pdf/word document clearly did not provide this ability.
2. The wiki will be easier for users/developers to reference then a pdf.

So, please take a look and see if you like the formatting. I decided to use
a combination of html tables and the wiki sections for organization.  I
think the html is pretty clean so that you can easily find the area you wish
to edit.

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_DetectionPoints

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_DetectionPoints#RE1:_Unexpected_HTTP_Commands

Feedback welcomed.  I have a script to generate this output so I can easily
change formatting, colors, layout whatever.

Looks great to me! The format seems quite helpful for developers ... much
better than the PDF.  The only possible issue I can see is if the code
"snippets" were to be a bit long.  It could be helpful depending on how that
plays out to possibly have another page per detection point w/ the code
snippets, but that can be done later.  Also, someone mentioned earlier it
may be helpful to have the snippets in different languages, so there may be
a better way to present that as well.  All in all, very nice!

Michael

This looks great.  A few questions and comments:

1. While its very useful to ahve it all on one page at the moment, as
content is added it might need to be split over multiple pages?

2. Did you say there might be a place for Drools?

3. If the code snippets become lengthy, perhaps they could be separate
pages too?

4. Should we have a space for cross references to other OWASP resources?

5. HTML seems fine... one suggestion: rather than typing the labels
ID, TITLE, etc in upper case, write them in lower case and use CSS to
display as upper case?

I adjusted per both of your feedback.

I decided to include links within the code section. They are ready to use.
Just click on the language of choice and you'll go to a unique wiki page for
that detection point. I also used anchors for the first 3 languages I
imagine we would tackle.

 I'll need to provide a template for the code page, but it would just be the
basic wiki style that used the appropriate headers for the internal page
anchors.

I think we are ready to go with this format.  Next we'll need to add in the
additional detection points that have been suggested over the past few
months.

The links to separate code pages will work well.

I tried adding a cross-reference to ModSecurity CRS in this one:

   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_DetectionPoints#EE2:_Unexpected_Encoding_Used

But I realise there are 299 AppSensor tags in the CRS rules:

- protocol violations: 3 rules
- http policy: 2 rules
- generic attacks: 32 rules
- SQL injection: 128 rules
- XSS attacks: 134 rules

so that won't work.  Perhaps a separate page would be more useful, but
even that may be difficult to keep up-to-date.

Ikes, there are lots of cross references.  Perhaps we can cross reference to
the XSS category instead of all 134 rules.  I think its good for us to show
that the two projects are inter-related. But we don't need to spin our
wheels maintaining every single cross-reference point.
