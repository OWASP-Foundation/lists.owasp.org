Jon (and all others interested),

I just pushed a change to the website. You can now retrieve both the
javadoc as well as the rest api documentation (via auto-generated swagger -
using enunciate library). The links are here: http://appsensor.org/api.html
. You're particularly interested in the endpoints for the
RestRequestHandler. Updating this will now become part of the release
cycle. (Note: the "try it out" links will be dead as this is not a real
appsensor server.)

This issue was tracked in: https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/issues/27

Let me know if you have any questions. Hope this helps.

Thanks,
John

All,

Wanted to pass along the latest info about the code portion of the project.

- We have as of late gotten a number of folks helping on the project (YAY!)
and a number of folks talking about how they are actually using the project
(separate email forthcoming).

- We've got work going on dockerizing portions of the project. (thanks Zach)

- We've got testing going on for using SQL server as a JPA data store.
(thanks Ashish)

- We now have documentation for both emitting to the ELK stack and
influx-db/grafana done as well as an influx-db emitter built (thanks
Sumanth) (thanks owasp summer of code)

- We have a student who is doing a senior project on AppSensor and will be
extending the capabilities of our analysis engines. (thanks Kelvin)

- We just added a new way of handling "block" (disable component) requests.
There is now an emitter as well as a reverse proxy you can use to implement
request blocking. We're looking at extending this model to handle more
capabilities "out of the box".

- We have several more folks who are looking at ways of contributing

- I'm doing some documentation work to try and simplify the workflow for
people just getting started with the project

- I gave a talk on appsensor 2.0 at appsecusa and shared a bit about where
we are with the project and where we're going (slides
http://www.slideshare.net/jtmelton/appsensor-near-real-time-event-detection-and-response)
(video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1imlD1O4HrY)

As you can see, it's been a busy past few months. Lots going on in the
project right now. Feel free to jump in and help. There are MANY ways to
contribute, so don't hesitate. If you have ideas about how to get folks to
contribute, I'd love to hear those.

As always, let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
John

Message-ID: <CAM8z=yL+AH9myAG_WY8K-vikd2ik5OkFNoeiqYN6ACn8HXB=Ug@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I've done a few appsensor presentations in the last 2 months. In talking
with folks afterwards, I've had at least a dozen people mention they are
actually using appsensor in production (awesome!).

We used to have a hard time getting folks to share that info with us, but
it seems much easier now. Given that, I'd like to start a logo page/section
on appsensor.org, something like a "These companies are already using
AppSensor".

I want to be very clear on this issue: OWASP is vendor-neutral, and as
such, we won't be recommending/marketing anyone's products - at all.
However, when evaluating software, most people don't want to be the first
one trying to use something. To that end, I think it'd be useful to show
who is already using the product so folks can have a level of trust in the
tool.

If you're using appsensor, and would be willing to share that with the
world, send me your information. If you'd like to give a quote about your
experience (testimonial), send me that too, and I'll try to incorporate
those as well.

I'm very proud of what this community has built, and I want to see it
continue to grow. Hoping this will help in some small way.

As always, let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
John

John,

I think this effort is very important to the OWASP foundation. Do you need any support from the board or foundation in general to help augment this project?

Keep up the great work and leadership.

Jim,

You've been a great benefactor of the project - thank you. You've asked
this question a couple of times, and I've never really had a good answer. I
thought I'd spend a bit of time coming up with a few ideas (in order of
what popped in my head first). Many/all of these could apply to various
owasp projects, not just appsensor.

- *a platform for funding pull requests / contributions to projects* - this
could be a way to financially reward folks for contributing. I know ZAP
recently experimented with this - not sure how it went, but we have money -
might be a good way to spend it (maybe leveraging something like the bithub
idea https://whispersystems.org/blog/bithub/). I would want the ability to
personally remove myself from the ability of receiving payment.

- *help with applying for grants* - including letting us know of available
grants and helping us do the paperwork if necessary

- *make inter-project recommendations* - since you sit at a level where you
see various projects, maybe make recommendations for areas where multiple
projects could collaborate for added value

- *project of the month* - this may already happen, but if not, maybe the
newsletter could feature a project every month, including information like
a project overview, an audio interview with the project leader(s), a list
of priority tasks for people to help with, etc.

- *get access to available free tools* - I've actually seen several tools
that are available for use within OWASP, though I hear about them
haphazardly. It would be good if there were a single resource for leads to
know what was available. Thinking of things like: free licenses of paid
software (intellij, webex) or access to products/services (surveymonkey,
AWS, GCE or Azure credits) that could be useful to the project

- *conducting surveys* - We do surveys periodically, and I fill them out.
Joanna has used them to good effect. We might be able to make that more
regular and get good data on our projects.

- *"help wanted" site* - We use github issues on our project. However, one
thing I hear repeatedly is project leaders saying they need help, and owasp
members asking how to help. It seems like we could put up a "jobs" board of
some kind to connect folks within the community for things like this. We
could probably connect this to $ in some way if we wanted to. I imagine
there's a tool out there that already does this too.

- *continue and expand "summer of code" programs* - I believe these
programs add lots of value. Not only do they get practical things done on
the projects, but they give us good visibility, get people involved in the
projects (many continue to contribute), give us good press in the
community, and invigorate the mentors as well.

Anyone else - please feel free to contribute other ideas.

Thanks,
John

Folks,

Just saw this ... Dominik Schadow (https://twitter.com/dschadow) presented
AppSensor at JavaOne today! The presentation and sample application using
AppSensor are both top notch. Please have a look if you're interested.

https://blog.dominikschadow.de/events/ (Dominik's event page with other
presentations)

https://github.com/dschadow/ApplicationIntrusionDetection (the sample
application)

http://files.dominikschadow.de/event_javaone2015-con2022.pdf (the
presentation pdf)

I asked him what, if any, feedback he received. A couple of things he
mentioned were that a) there was a lot of interest and that b) AppSensor
needs more advertisement!

Thanks to Dominik for his hard, excellent work on this.

If anybody has ideas about "advertising" or wants to help get the word out,
certainly jump in.

A special note of thanks to all of our contributors. This was a good
validation of the effort from everyone - thank you!

Thanks,
John

Great effort Dominik!

'AppSensor needs more advertisement!'

This is the point I was trying to suggest few months ago. Here are few
thoughts I have in mind:

*1)* Ask users testimonials (I remember at some point one of you said,
testimonials are hard to get because of security/confidentiality issues).

I think we could ask these users to at least write-up few blog entries
about AppSensor and spread on social media?

*2) *This project needs some "tech press" coverage, may be we can pick few
recent security breaches and develop a story saying how AppSensor could
have helped in identifying those etc.,

AppSensor project technical leadership and members are visionary, I think
this team need another visionary (let us say marketing) to spread word
about this in all possible ways.

Thank you,
Giri

Thanks for the feedback Giri!

To address #1, I did send out a request yesterday for that type of
information:
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-appsensor-project/2015-October/001022.html

To address #2, I agree. This is not my skill set, but it would be great if
someone would be willing to help here. I did send out this list of ideas to
Jim Manico to take to the board for help:
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-appsensor-project/2015-October/001024.html
. If you (or anyone else) have any further ideas, certainly let Jim know
and he can add them to my list for discussion with the board.

Thanks,

I think this was a great model for spreading the word. Go to [language]con with an example implementation in that language.

Zach, Agreed.

If anyone on list has an interest in a specific language, let us know and
we can help get an example setup if one doesn't already exist.

Thanks,

That is nice approach Zach.

John,

On "user testimonials" point, if they are reluctant to share their logos,
may be we can ask for "how they used", post the story on AppSensor website
and mask user details.

For example:

Well known company in Aviation industry used AppSensor for the purpose of
...... and they gained...... etc.,

Thank you,
Giri

All,

It's been pointed out to me that getting a logo (while easier) is still not
always possible. To that end, if you'd like to share an anonymous story
(preferably with your industry vertical at least) about what you're doing
with appsensor (very generic), that would also be really helpful. Something
like :

"Company in Aviation industry used AppSensor for the purpose of ...... and
they gained benefits of ...... etc."

If you think that would be a better route for your organization, let me
know, and we can add those types of references.

Thanks,
John

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] blacklist regex repository
Message-ID: <CAM8z=yLe-72iVS79OB4=Zo9yUGynxMFZv5FMa1gVvFeP8Q5-vQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

A topic arose today around a "blacklist" or set of signatures for XSS and
SQLi that could be used in appsensor. It would be difficult and a waste of
resources to define these on a per-project basis. It would be nice to have
a list of these to pull from for detection purposes.

Ryan Barnett pointed to this project as an existing project specifically
intended to fill this requirement:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Blacklist_Regex_Repository

An example of the type of thing we're looking at building is here:
https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/blob/v3.0.0-dev/util/regression-tests/tests.xml

(this could also serve as inspiration:
https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/tree/master/base_rules)

2 questions:
- do folks have other ideas? does something like this already exist?
- who wants to contribute here? This project would benefit us as well as
other projects

Thanks,
John

I know that most of them aren?t regex, but have you look at the payload in fuzzdb ? when we did try AppSensor we were using the XSS payload of fuzzdb to trigger an XSS event : https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb

Ha, you would be amazed at the amount of ?abuse case? unit tests WAF defense folks need to keep :)  It is certainly not as easy as blocking ?<script? or ?union select? strings?

Holy cow, https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb is epic. That would make a great owasp project :)

It?s not OWASP but it is open, OWASP could start its own project from that list or suggest them to join. I don?t know how it is in your organization, but here we keep our own list of such payloads and having a common stockpile of it could be handy.

 

For a while fuzzdb was really out of date and was abandoned but someone revived it a couple of months ago and moved it to github.

All, 

A topic arose today around a "blacklist" or set of signatures for XSS and SQLi that could be used in appsensor. It would be difficult and a waste of resources to define these on a per-project basis. It would be nice to have a list of these to pull from for detection purposes. 

 

Ryan Barnett pointed to this project as an existing project specifically intended to fill this requirement: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Blacklist_Regex_Repository

An example of the type of thing we're looking at building is here: https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/blob/v3.0.0-dev/util/regression-tests/tests.xml

(this could also serve as inspiration: https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/tree/master/base_rules)

2 questions: 

- do folks have other ideas? does something like this already exist?

- who wants to contribute here? This project would benefit us as well as other projects

 

Thanks,

John
