Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Response Actions
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=C55dCb4jvxpg_MKjhNfU4Pqxk=O8rNKAumV9+@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

The AppSensor v1.1 lists four response actions:

* Security Violation Message
* Account Logout
* Account Lockout
* Administrator Notification

but other actions are also mentioned:

* Function Disabled (e.g disable add friend feature, prevent new site
registrations)

I suppose "Administrator Notification" might be be broadened to
include messaging other systems (e.g. SIEM), although the example
"con" is "used too often".

Also, some extra ideas can be found in recent presentations and emails
to the list:

1)  Logging Increased (e.g. capture request headers and full responses)

2) Terminate Process (e.g. ask user to begin business process again
from start) - a softer version of account logout

3) Time Delays Introduced/Increased (e.g. extend response time for
each failed authentication attempt, add delays into every response)

4) Function Amended (e.g. reduce payment transfer limit before
additional out-of-band verification is required, limit on feature
usage rate imposed, additional registration validation steps,
additional anti-automation measures, static rather than dynamic
content returned)

5) User Characterisation Updated (e.g. internal trustworthiness
scoring changed) ???? not sure about this - but could be used to
"flag" an account as at risk, so if the telephone helpdesk receive a
lost password enquiry, they might amend their behaviour there ?????

6) Application Disabled (e.g. website shut down and replaced with
temporary static page, one user's IP address range blocked)

Some of the above might be applied to just the current User or
system-wide affecting all Users.  Some of the responses are time
independent (e.g. alert to administrator), some might have a time
period associated with them (e.g. temporary account lock-out) and some
might be considered relatively permanent from the app's point of view
(e.g. permanent lock-out, application disabled).

Some may be "silent" actions in that the user is unaware of them, and
in others the user may be informed.

I was thinking of writing this up in more detail and any suggestions
or comments would be welcome.  For example, would it be useful to have
reference codes for each type of response so we can log what action
was taken?  If so, what naming convention?

Regards

Colin

7)  Collect User Data (e.g. deploy additional browser fingerprinting
JavaScript, deploy a Java applet to collect remote IP address, delpoy
JavaScript to collect information about the user's network)

Colin,
I like the idea of a nice write-up for all of these (nice work already).  I
would also like to propose somewhere in your write-up to have a quick
reference table for all the response actions, so I can just get a quick list
of them, even though there may be more detail below.  I would think this
table might also include columns for the different attributes (like
time-dependent, silent, etc that you put in your email) with a simple check
or something if it applies to that response action (this was just my first
thought of how to do it, really just thinking about a 1 page printable
"quick-view").  I also like your recommendation of a useful reference code
collection, but I haven't come up with anything useful for a naming
convention.

Thanks,
John

Thanks very much for your thoughts.  I've put together a summary sheet
with all the things you mentioned - well it's more than one page and
includes most of my thinking to date.  I think the file is too large
to send to this list so have added it as a PDF to the site for now:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appsensor-responses.pdf

It is draft, and needs further thought and input.

I have renamed "Security Violation Message" to the more generic "User
Notification" similar to "Administrator Notification".  Also, I
disliked my own idea of including things like sending to SIEM as part
of "Administrator Notification", and have suggested "Other
Notification" for those types of things.

I also changed "User Characterisation Updated" to "User Status
Change".  Table 2 (Examples) hopefully explains better.

Once this document is more final, I can probably produce a wiki page,
breaking it down into more pages.

Regards

Colin

Colin,
This is really excellent work!  It's clear a lot of thought and effort went
into it.  I have only good things to say.  This simplified classifications
do a great job of making things very clear and flexible as future response
actions are considered and categorized.  Very nice.

Thanks, I value your feedback.

I noticed two errors... an extra space in one word, and an
inconsistency in how I describe the SYSLOG levels 0 and 1 in the text
(the table is correct).  I'll amend those and update the PDF.  I can
also put the source OO file somewhere, and produce a more accessible
wiki page.

Colin,

I agree w/ Michael. I've been working on ESAPI, so have just found a
chance to look this over. Very well thought out organization. I hope
you are also assisting on the OWASP Dev Guide project because they could
definitely use some help like this there.

I'd give it two thumbs up.

Michael and Kevin

Thanks guys.

I'll see about weaving it into the wiki somehow, and making sure the
other AppSensor wiki pages are consistent with the new extended list
of detection points.

Hi

I saw mention of a proposed authentication security mechanism on the
WebSecurity mailing list:

  http://www.webappsec.org/lists/websecurity/archive/2010-08/msg00036.html

Checking out the details to see if the proposed list of Response
Actions includes everything:

1) Varying the limit on number of authentication failures before
lock-out sounds like:

     ASR-D  User Status Change
     ASR-K  Account Lockout

2) Adding a CAPTCHA and/or inserting a time delay (at random or of
random content/delay?) sound like:

    ASR-H  Function Amended
    ASR-F  Timing Change

On the issue of "can be abused by a bad guy to lock most or all of the
users by writing a script with all the possible
permutations and combinations for a username... resulting in a denial
of service", might be detected by AppSensor's User and System Trend
Exceptions, with an action targeted at a user (unauthenticated
session), some users (IP block) or all users.

Agreed.  These types of issues seem to already be covered by appsensor.  I
think the core problem he's trying to solve (an attacker locking all users)
is certainly already covered by appsensor well through the trend monitoring
coverage.  The other features (varying # of lockout attempts individually)
are not particularly useful against a script based attack once the attacker
figures out the max # of lockouts is 7 or 5 or whatever it is.  I think
trend monitoring is a much better protection mechanism since it can look at
trends of a single user and / or the entire system.

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Upcoming AppSensor Presentation
Message-ID: <4C7BDE13.10806@owasp.org>

 AppSensor Crew,

I hope to see many of you at the upcoming OWASP AppSec conference in
Irvine, CA. 

I will be presenting on day 2 about AppSensor. The talk will cover
AppSensor's current status and its integration with ESAPI. In addition I
will also be talking about how AppSensor ideas are being incorporated
into Mozilla web applications to actively identify application attackers. 

Finally, I will also be debuting a new demo application called
AppSensor-Tutorial.  This demo code base is a fully working jsp app with
ESAPI and AppSensor integration. The purpose is to provide lesson based
examples of how to use AppSensor. The code is intended to be as clear
and concise as possible so that it can be referenced as an example of
how to easily use AppSensor with ESAPI. 

You can get a preview of the code here:

http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/#svn/trunk/AppSensor-Tutorial

Detailed instructions for setup will be coming soon.
