All,

I'm happy to announce the public release of the AppSensor Beta document.

This is the first public release of the document. The document has been through the Summer of Code reviews which includes a mid point and final review by two reviewers (thanks Eric and Randy).

I encourage those interested to review the document and provide any questions or comments to this mailing list.
