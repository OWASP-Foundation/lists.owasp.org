I guess we could? My goal was to get some of the goals of the project documented for this bid, after all our problems don't begin until we receive the grant. 

It would allow us to do a lot of things we just don't think about because they are way to expensive to pull off. Think about the beautiful graphic design in OWASP SAMM for example; it adds a lot - and makes the project look much more professional than many of our other projects that are equally mature and viable. Cash makes a difference. ;-)

I was just getting stuff on paper in the hope that Seba and Samantha wind up with a really great problem for us to have to solve.

</I>
I have no doubt that printing books, cards, etc&#8230; will create the required receipts. As well as travel to give talks about AppSensor. 

&gt;<i>

</I>
A party no - a working session? perhaps - you will note that I didn't put that in the list. ;-) However, imagine John is ready for release and we spent a week documenting and testing the hell out of it? In addition to doing final reviews on the book? As well as the working out the logistics to launch the new book with the release, and figuring out the dog and pony show tour of the world? We may very well have a ton of fun for us - but that would be a mere side effect of the concentrated effort and rapid communication that money could provide us to get work done by bringing us together.
