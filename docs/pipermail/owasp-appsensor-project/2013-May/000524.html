Hello Colin,

I am writing to reach out to you regarding a new grant opportunity I
am working on. Let me start by giving you a bit of background on the
opportunity. In the last weeks we (myself and Seba) have researched to
partner with LSEC (an independent not-for-profit network organisation
uniting a variety of experts of IT security, details on www.lsec.be)
in Belgium to respond to a call for projects from the European
Commission (EC) within the ICT PSP Competitiveness and Innovation
Framework Programme (CIP) 2013, as part of the EC Europe 2020 Strategy
(details on <A HREF="http://ec.europa.eu/cip/">http://ec.europa.eu/cip/</A> with the call for projects on
<A HREF="http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/page/call_CIP">http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/page/call_CIP</A>).

This is a project under Call 4, Trusted eServices, for the protection
of websites against attacks and stimulating the uptake of innovative
ICT based services and products, which falls right within the OWASP
body of knowledge.

The main objective is to have better protection of business and
website owners against cyber-attacks against their websites, affecting
their business and reputation and reducing the risk of spreading
malware. Additionally, we aim to increase the security of users and
consumers by reducing the security threats created by malicious
websites.

The OWASP AppSensor Project has been selected as a potential project
to participate in this initiative. We would like to know if you are
interested in participating in this initiative.

I would like to encourage you to join our call next Tuesday, May 07,
2013 at 8:30pm CET. Seba and I will be on hand to explain this
opportunity in more detail, and please feel free to reach out to us
before then if you have any questions.

Looking forward to speaking with you next week.


Thank you, Colin.
