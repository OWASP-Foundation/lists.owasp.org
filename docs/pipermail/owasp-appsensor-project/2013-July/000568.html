This is one reason why we require baysian statistics in security. On of 
the issues created by the Zeus banking trojans is that the botnet 
actually knows which computer it compromised and keeps the ip within the 
same geo-location. So Geo-Location as proposed by John will fail to stop 
banking fraud, and will prevent legitimate mobile users from accessing 
the site.

What we require is behavioural profiling of legitimate users, which is 
exactly what your credit card companies do when they see an 'statistical 
deviation' due to a certain purchase; which prompts them to call you and 
verify the purchase (and what is suggested by Ryan).

I think the geo location sensor is useful for just this reason - we can 
'profile' 'normal' activity and flag 'statistical deviation.' If you 
normally log in via mobile, perhaps I should be concerned about your 
geoIP which indicates your are home or visa versa.

We are now at a point where we can grow beyond the original static 
sensors; this is an important juncture - we now realise that there is 
useful meta-data that can be used as information in conjunction with 
other sensors! This is an important juncture.

I'll share an example I used at the bank. For every AppSensor, there is 
a random function that  may or may not allow an attack to continue 
instead of neutralise it. So every single detection point becomes a 
'random' honey pot. The attacker can not predict the success of the 
attack, nor can anybody on the red-team will know. The application 
decides at random, at the bank we allowed 1% of all attacks to turn into 
honey-pots. I don't know if that is sufficient; it was what I was 
allowed.

However, it allows you to see what the attacker is going to do after a 
seemingly successful attack, and this provides you with additional 
information you would have otherwise lost! (not unlike AppSensor 
itself!)

Because it is random, you can keep the loss threshold at an acceptable 
level (in my case 1%), while still gaining additional information about 
the attack for later mitigation or prosecution. Geo-IP would allow this 
to operate even more precisely because the random could be triggered 
where the confidence of fraud was greater that the probability of 
anomaly.

The next level of 'AppSensor' is a randomly activated honey-pot. Instead 
of neutralising the successful attack, it allows it, and watches it; 
while keeping continuing to keep the attack benign.
