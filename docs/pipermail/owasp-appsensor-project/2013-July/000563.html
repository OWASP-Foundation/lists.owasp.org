All,

Hate to be a fly in the ointment, but I think we need to think
this through a bit more.

I think one question that ought to be asked if a person is normally
using a phone or other mobile device with GPS or other location
info made available and then all of a sudden, that information
stops coming, how would / should this detection point react?
Would it even be triggered? Might we consider it a normal thing
that someone disables their GPS? (I do that all the time to save
battery. Even more often since the Snowden leaks, but I digress.)
But if the geo-location information is based on something like
GPS or the courser-grained cell-tower triangulation and then an
app stops getting that? Do we flag it or not? How do we recommend
an application using this detection point in AppSensor proceed
if that information suddenly becomes unavailable?  Note that
having an answer for this is important. If we simply say &quot;okay,
it is normal for people to disable these services to save batteries
or whatever&quot;, then an attacker can just not send that information.
On the other hand, if you try to locate this simply based on
information for IP addresses, that is liable to have a lot of false
positives. For instance, if I login to my company VPN from home
and access your site, it puts me at one location. However, if I
access your site from the same PC directly (while still at my home),
it may look like I'm instantly a thousand miles or more away.

The other issue that I have with basing location solely on IP
addresses is I'm not sure how well that is actually going to work
once (someday!) we all regularly start using IPv6.
