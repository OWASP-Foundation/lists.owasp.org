<PRE>Dennis

I feel a new book chapter emerging ;-)

I hope this is an extract from it, or some draft notes to start it!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with your last paragraph in that this should be used as a potential fraud
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indicator and not something that you would just start blocking on its own.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While the issues of mobile/VPN usage are valid, I am also looking at fact
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that there are a large percentage of banking users that never use mobile
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> devices and only bank from their home computer system.  For these users,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have some type of GeoLocation validation works great for them and would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allow securty systems to quickly identify an anomalous event if their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> location changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is one reason why we require baysian statistics in security. On of the
</I>&gt;<i> issues created by the Zeus banking trojans is that the botnet actually knows
</I>&gt;<i> which computer it compromised and keeps the ip within the same geo-location.
</I>&gt;<i> So Geo-Location as proposed by John will fail to stop banking fraud, and
</I>&gt;<i> will prevent legitimate mobile users from accessing the site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What we require is behavioural profiling of legitimate users, which is
</I>&gt;<i> exactly what your credit card companies do when they see an 'statistical
</I>&gt;<i> deviation' due to a certain purchase; which prompts them to call you and
</I>&gt;<i> verify the purchase (and what is suggested by Ryan).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the geo location sensor is useful for just this reason - we can
</I>&gt;<i> 'profile' 'normal' activity and flag 'statistical deviation.' If you
</I>&gt;<i> normally log in via mobile, perhaps I should be concerned about your geoIP
</I>&gt;<i> which indicates your are home or visa versa.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are now at a point where we can grow beyond the original static sensors;
</I>&gt;<i> this is an important juncture - we now realise that there is useful
</I>&gt;<i> meta-data that can be used as information in conjunction with other sensors!
</I>&gt;<i> This is an important juncture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll share an example I used at the bank. For every AppSensor, there is a
</I>&gt;<i> random function that  may or may not allow an attack to continue instead of
</I>&gt;<i> neutralise it. So every single detection point becomes a 'random' honey pot.
</I>&gt;<i> The attacker can not predict the success of the attack, nor can anybody on
</I>&gt;<i> the red-team will know. The application decides at random, at the bank we
</I>&gt;<i> allowed 1% of all attacks to turn into honey-pots. I don't know if that is
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient; it was what I was allowed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, it allows you to see what the attacker is going to do after a
</I>&gt;<i> seemingly successful attack, and this provides you with additional
</I>&gt;<i> information you would have otherwise lost! (not unlike AppSensor itself!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because it is random, you can keep the loss threshold at an acceptable level
</I>&gt;<i> (in my case 1%), while still gaining additional information about the attack
</I>&gt;<i> for later mitigation or prosecution. Geo-IP would allow this to operate even
</I>&gt;<i> more precisely because the random could be triggered where the confidence of
</I>&gt;<i> fraud was greater that the probability of anomaly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The next level of 'AppSensor' is a randomly activated honey-pot. Instead of
</I>&gt;<i> neutralising the successful attack, it allows it, and watches it; while
</I>&gt;<i> keeping continuing to keep the attack benign.
</I>&gt;<i>
