<PRE>Timo

Thank you very much for taking the time to provide feedback on the
AppSensor Guide. We want to keep improving it and it's helpful to me,
and I'm sure others on the list, to receive other people's
perspectives.

My comments in line...

</I>&gt;<i> Hi I got your email from John Melton. I'm helping to review the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation for app sensor and
</I>&gt;<i> I'm planning on helping to put together some developer documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here are some of my comments on the book.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards.
</I>&gt;<i> Timo
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - ------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> AppSensor V2 Book: Review:
</I>&gt;<i> - -------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Page 55:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Mobile technicians connect to smart meters using an infrared optical
</I>&gt;<i> port which is
</I>&gt;<i> more reliable in the many different locations that the meters can be
</I>&gt;<i> installed in
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> More reliable than what? And also more reliable in what way?
</I>
Good catch, &quot;more reliable than other data connectors&quot;. I will update the book.



&gt;<i> &quot;The long, highly random, security codes could be identified by
</I>&gt;<i> brute force and dictionary attacks.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what this means? Are you saying that if someone attempted
</I>&gt;<i> to guess the
</I>&gt;<i> long and highly random passwords that it would be possible if they did
</I>&gt;<i> so over a long period of time using a brute force attack?
</I>
Yes, because there is no lock out.



&gt;<i> Just btw, this example of people trying to hack smart power meters is a
</I>&gt;<i> very relevant one. This happens all the time
</I>&gt;<i> and people find very creative ways to bypass the built in mechanisms to
</I>&gt;<i> prevent people from trying to hack them. Especially
</I>&gt;<i> in my country (South Africa) this is something that people like to do
</I>&gt;<i> and get away with.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe an example to add
</I>&gt;<i> is to detect if someone is just completely bypassing the meter but
</I>&gt;<i> keeping some electricity connected to the meter just so the meter won't
</I>&gt;<i> notice
</I>&gt;<i> that it is being bypassed.
</I>
So a detection point might be &quot;no use of electricity&quot; or something like that?


&gt;<i>  People also often like to put these meters
</I>&gt;<i> in metal containers to stop any mobile signal from notifying the meter
</I>&gt;<i> vendor that the meter is being tampered with.(think of this as a
</I>&gt;<i> Faraday cage, similar technique is used in South Africa when stealing
</I>&gt;<i> cars with tracking devices).
</I>
Interesting. I wonder how the app would &quot;know&quot;.



&gt;<i> - -----------------------
</I>&gt;<i> Page 90:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Remember, AppSensor is concerned with identifying and stopping attacks
</I>&gt;<i> against unknown vulnerabilities such as:...Zero day vulnerability in a
</I>&gt;<i> code library used by the application.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe give an example of how app sensor will actually do this. For
</I>&gt;<i> example how would this help to identify and stop an attack
</I>&gt;<i> on an application running the vulnerable YAML parser which was used in
</I>&gt;<i> many Rails applications, I can't remember the name of the library used
</I>&gt;<i> but this is the CVE: <A HREF="http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-0156">http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-0156</A>
</I>
I will look that one up, and expand this text in the book. Thank you.


&gt;<i> - -----------------
</I>&gt;<i> Another suggestion:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't see anything in the book(although at the time of writing this
</I>&gt;<i> at his been some time since I read the book) about using app sensor to
</I>&gt;<i> detect people who have gone past exploiting the web application and
</I>&gt;<i> now have a shell on your box.  You could perhaps use app sensor to for
</I>&gt;<i> example check any activity on
</I>&gt;<i> the machine running as the www-data or www user and doing something
</I>&gt;<i> out of the ordinary.  I'm not sure how this would be done , but just a
</I>&gt;<i> thought.
</I>
I think the idea of detecting host, configuration and code changes was
mentioned briefly on this mailing list a few years ago, but it hasn't
really been built upon, and as you say does not appear in the book at
all. I suppose if the host is compromised perhaps we can't trust the
application either, but in our mobile app example we have this
potential issue too. Perhaps we should add a chapter about
physical/environment changes?
