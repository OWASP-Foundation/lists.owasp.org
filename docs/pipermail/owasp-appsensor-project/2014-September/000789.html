Here are some comments on the book (Appsensor guide v2):

Hi I got your email from John Melton. I'm helping to review the
documentation for app sensor and
I'm planning on helping to put together some developer documentation.

Here are some of my comments on the book.

Regards.
Timo

AppSensor V2 Book: Review:
- -------------------

Page 55:

&quot;Mobile technicians connect to smart meters using an infrared optical
port which is
more reliable in the many different locations that the meters can be
installed in
&quot;
More reliable than what? And also more reliable in what way?

&quot;The long, highly random, security codes could be identified by
brute force and dictionary attacks.&quot;
I'm not sure what this means? Are you saying that if someone attempted
to guess the
long and highly random passwords that it would be possible if they did
so over a long period of time using a brute force attack?

Just btw, this example of people trying to hack smart power meters is a
very relevant one. This happens all the time
and people find very creative ways to bypass the built in mechanisms to
prevent people from trying to hack them. Especially
in my country (South Africa) this is something that people like to do
and get away with.
Maybe an example to add
is to detect if someone is just completely bypassing the meter but
keeping some electricity connected to the meter just so the meter won't
notice
that it is being bypassed.  People also often like to put these meters
in metal containers to stop any mobile signal from notifying the meter
vendor that the meter is being tampered with.(think of this as a
Faraday cage, similar technique is used in South Africa when stealing
cars with tracking devices).

- -----------------------
Page 90:

&quot;Remember, AppSensor is concerned with identifying and stopping attacks
against unknown vulnerabilities such as:...Zero day vulnerability in a
code library used by the application.&quot;
Maybe give an example of how app sensor will actually do this. For
example how would this help to identify and stop an attack
on an application running the vulnerable YAML parser which was used in
many Rails applications, I can't remember the name of the library used
but this is the CVE: <A HREF="http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-0156">http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-0156</A>
- -----------------
Another suggestion:

I didn't see anything in the book(although at the time of writing this
at his been some time since I read the book) about using app sensor to
detect people who have gone past exploiting the web application and
now have a shell on your box.  You could perhaps use app sensor to for
example check any activity on
the machine running as the www-data or www user and doing something
out of the ordinary.  I'm not sure how this would be done , but just a
thought.
