Message-ID: <CAAxdBBnJFALD9nseKb9L35SUpJYepanQTG7ytviYAxjg7qqF4w@mail.gmail.com>

A while ago I thought it might be a good idea to get some visibility
of AppSensor into the upcoming releases of the OWASP Code Review Guide
and OWASP Testing Guide. Sort of publicity for the concept.

Well, I've had a go at a first draft for the Code Review Guide, but am
sure other people will be able to improve it:

  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CRV2_ActiveDefense

The idea is to help a code reviewer determine whether AppSensor-like
capabilities exist, or not. Please feel free to add/remove/alter
content.

Similar to my message about the code review guide yesterday, I wanted
to add visibility about AppSensor into the v4 OWASP Testing Guide.
Here is what I have written so far:

   Test defenses against application mis-use (OTG-BUSLOGIC-011)
   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Test_defenses_against_application_mis-use_(OTG-BUSLOGIC-011)

This attempts to illustrate how a tester would detect whether active
defenses exist. Not an exact science I know.  Please feel free to
add/expand/remove/alter content.

Hello AppSensor team,

I just want to let you know that I have received word from the DHS about
your project grant proposal. I am happy to report that you have been
awarded your grant from DHS and Georgia Tech.

I will reach out with more details once I hear back from Deb from the HOST
program.

Reach out to me if you have questions.

Congratulations, AppSensor team! Very well done to all!  :-)

Sam G.

Dear Samantha,
**

Thank you again for submitting an application on OWASP's behalf during our
Open Call for Investment Applications that took place between July 2nd and
August 14, 2013. This call for investments produced twenty-eight
applications.  Four projects were selected for funding within the HOST
program, a number of others are being referred for potential funding
outside of the HOST program by DHS S&T. We are notifying all applicants of
their award status today.*

*
We are pleased to inform you that your project has been selected for HOST
Investment funding. We will contact you soon to discuss the next steps in
the investment process, and work to draft an agreement, including a scope
of work between your organization and Georgia Tech Research Institute.
(Please direct your emails to investments at opencybersecurity.org email for
correspondence; someone on the team will reply.)

We have included key feedback from the peer reviewers for your information
below my signature.*
*
*
*On behalf of the HOST team, congratulations and welcome to the program. We
look forward to working with you.*
*
*
*Best Regards,*
*

Application: OWASP AppSensor Project (project design support)
Organization: OWASP Foundation
POC: Samantha Groves; samantha.groves at owasp.org; 480-800-9830

Feedback:

There was general consensus among reviewers that this project is a small
investment for a valuable part of the Appsensor Project, including useful
documentation of a high quality. They also believe the software components
and method will actually be usable, and define sound practices for handling
security issues at the applications level. The reviewers also noted the
importance of OWASP and the fact that it is volunteer-driven and therefore
deserves support to remain viable.

To be fair,

The staff also deserve a great thank you as well.  They not only identify these opportunities, organize them by deadline and then recruit  people from each project to complete the project specific parts of the grants. They then write the non project specific parts of the grants and then have them edited and submitted before the deadline.  I know that Samantha did this for 28 grants proposals this year and that was prior to October.  
 
Cheers,

Dennis

Yes without the staff team this would not have happened at all.

I found the comments interesting, especially

   "There was general consensus among reviewers that this [HOST] project
    is a small investment for a valuable part of the Appsensor Project, ..."

and how being associated with OWASP and being a voluntary effort assisted
our bid:

  "The reviewers also noted the importance of OWASP and the fact that
   it is volunteer-driven and therefore deserves support to remain viable."

I guess being vendor neutral also helps.  As a reminder about what we
applied for, the discussion thread is here:


http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-appsensor-project/2013-August/thread.html

and the submission here:


https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1cFbmOLqEQQG8eXPrMTlU6JUivgRIacUeL7D599bZm_E/edit

The submission was at fairly short notice and we bid for support for
something we can deliver very soon, in this case book and flyer
professional design

   "...including useful documentation of a high quality."

But in our August discussions we also thought perhaps applying for other
software development funding in a future round if this went well and the
opportunity still existed. And the discussion homed in on a
reporting/dashboard tool.

    "They also believe the software components and method will actually be
usable,
     and define sound practices for handling security issues at the
applications level. "

The combination of documentation and code makes AppSensor highly attractive.

I think many AppSensor contributors will be at AppSec USA, so it would be a
good opportunity to discuss this funding and ideas for 2014.

Meanwhile, we now need to get the book text finished :-)

Samantha,
What day(s) would the working session fall on? Is it up to us? Would it be
before / during the con?

Thanks,
John

After a bit of offline chat ...

I am thinking I'd like to do a session Monday or Tuesday as W/R will be
quite busy. I was planning to be doing some work on the code by myself, but
if others want to get together and work on code and/or anything else we
need, I'm happy to do that as well.

Colin, I know you're heading up the book. Anything you'd like to cover in a
group setting?

Thanks,
John

I agree, I think people will be too busy during the conference days.
However I am undertaking a training course on the Mon/Tue so won't be
able to do anything there myself, but please don't let my availability
influence this occurring. You probably don't want my code anyway!

I will be progressing book matters anyway, but will also try to catch
up with everyone during the course of the week. On that topic, I will
be in town on Sunday 17th if anyone else wants to catch up more
casually then.

Sounds good.

Samantha, could we schedule Monday afternoon, say from 1 to 5 (or some
similar timeframe) for our session?

Thanks,
John

Yes, of course. May I ask... Can you send over a short description of what
the session will be about, and what you hope to accomplish? I need to put
it on the official schedule so people can sign up if they are interested.

Thank you, John and Team.

I blatantly ripped off much of the ESAPI hackathon text, but here you go:

Take part in building the next generation of AppSensor. In this hackathon
we will focus on building the code for AppSensor 2.0, which will involve
moving to a services (both REST and SOAP) model for event detection and
response. During the hackathon, the AppSensor development leaders will be
designing and coding side-by-side with you. Come join us and help make the
AppSensor idea available to all!

Thanks,
John
