<PRE>Hello,

My name is Cosmin Stefan-Dobrin and I am a student at the Politechnics
University of Bucharest, Computer Science faculty. I am an extremely
passionate programmer (and soon-to-be engineer), who's always interested in
the latest technologies and latest trends in IT development. I am
interested in applying for Google Summer Of Code 2012, and the projects
proposed by OWASP (and particularly AppSensor) are extremely interesting.
I'm a fast learner and I have quite a lot of experience in Java, Android,
C/C++, HTML, CSS, JS, SOAP/REST principles, Google Appengine and using
git/svn as I've worked on numerous projects at the university and on my
spare time (one of the biggest projects I've recently worked on is
www.feedrz.com, which is only at its beginnings and which I have developed
with a friend, during the free time).

I am interested in working on AppSensor during the GSOC. Some of the
proposed tasks ( *&quot;**REST web service server implementation**&quot;*, *&quot;SOAP web
service server implementation**&quot;* and &quot;*SOAP/REST web service client
implementation*&quot;) have particularly caught my attention, altough they're
not the only AppSensor projects that seem interesting. I have some
experience with REST, SOAP and web services as I have used both of them
(both server-side and client-side) on some projects I developed in the
past. I have to say that, if I have to choose, I would go with REST
(because of more experience). Anyway, I would like to know what should I do
next (in the following days), to get better connected to the project? And,
I am going to ask pretty straight and honest, which of the projects is the
most important for AppSensor, as I would be interested in helping you with
what you need most.

Regarding the projects, I would also have 1 question (for now):



   - The developer for the web-server implementation (for let's say REST)
   will also do/or help the web-client for that service type?

Thank you and have a wonderful day,
Cosmin
