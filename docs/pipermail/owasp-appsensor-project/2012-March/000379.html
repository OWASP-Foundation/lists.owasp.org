<PRE>Cosmin,

Thanks very much for your interest in the project! I'm the lead
developer on appsensor. Looks like you have some good experience that
you could contribute to the project. As for getting connected to the
project, I'd suggest you take a look at the book (linked off this
page: <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project</A>). It
will describe a lot of the principles in detail if you're interested.
Also, feel free to pull down the source from google code (svn). As for
what is most important to us in the update, I'd say the soap/rest
service/client implementations are definitely the largest and most
important tasks. One thing I did want to point out, though, is that
both the &quot;client&quot; and &quot;server&quot; pieces will be application servers.
There is no user interface development to what we're building. This is
all back-end communication and building services to expose data (the
reporting services).

If you're interested in submitting for the project, use the google
link to submit your proposal. OWASP provided a sample proposal you can
use as a basis.

Looking forward to working with you if everything works out! If you
have any further questions, feel free to respond to the list or me
directly.

Thanks,
John

</I>&gt;<i> OWASP (and particularly AppSensor) are extremely interesting. I'm a fast

</I>&gt;<i> CSS, JS, SOAP/REST principles, Google Appengine and using git/svn as I've
</I>&gt;<i> worked on numerous projects at the university and on my spare time (one of

</I>&gt;<i> only at its beginnings and which I have developed with a friend, during the
</I>&gt;<i> free time).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am interested in working on AppSensor during the GSOC. Some of the
</I>&gt;<i> proposed tasks ( &quot;REST web service server implementation&quot;, &quot;SOAP web service
</I>&gt;<i> server implementation&quot; and &quot;SOAP/REST web service client implementation&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> have particularly caught my attention, altough they're not the only
</I>&gt;<i> AppSensor projects that seem interesting. I have some experience with REST,
</I>&gt;<i> SOAP and web services as I have used both of them (both server-side and
</I>&gt;<i> client-side) on some projects I developed in the past. I have to say that,
</I>&gt;<i> if I have to choose, I would go with REST (because of more experience).
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I would like to know what should I do next (in the following days),
</I>&gt;<i> to get better connected to the project? And, I am going to ask pretty
</I>&gt;<i> straight and honest, which of the projects is the most important for
</I>&gt;<i> AppSensor, as I would be interested in helping you with what you need most.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the projects, I would also have 1 question (for now):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The developer for the web-server implementation (for let's say REST) will
</I>&gt;<i> also do/or help the web-client for that service type?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you and have a wonderful day,
</I>&gt;<i> Cosmin
