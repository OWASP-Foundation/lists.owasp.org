<PRE>AppSensor fans

I have received the result (see below) of our entry for the IFSEC
Future of Security competition in the Global Security Challenge.  We
were not successful.  I logged on, and have pasted the judges'
&quot;Overall opinion / Comments&quot; feedback below:

Judge   Feedback
========================================================
1          Interesting approach, though I am not sure I fully
understand it. Is the not-for-profit linkage an issue ?
2          Useful concept, but limited feel for the market potential.
3          An unusual background to this entry. It clearly addresses a
need but there must be competition in this space.
4          Historically, the intruder detection market has been a slow
mover. Great to see developments proceeding here. Targeting the
architects will not hurt, either.
========================================================

It's a bit disappointing, considering all the effort and support a
number of people, and the GPC, gave this.  There is another higher
value competition in progress <A HREF="http://www.omnicompete.com/security.html">http://www.omnicompete.com/security.html</A>
(closing date 31 May) with an award of up to $500,000, but OWASP is
neither a very recent start-up nor an SME, so I think we are excluded.

THANKS FOR EVERYONE'S HELP, but I'm sorry it didn't work out.

Colin

Hello, Colin !
Dear Entrant,

IFSEC results

Thank you for applying to the IFSEC Future of Security Competition 2011.

The Judging Committee has now reviewed all the submissions for the
Competition and unfortunately, your entry was not selected as a
finalist.

The quality of the submitted ideas was extremely high and not being
selected as a finalist does not imply that the Judging Committee was
not impressed with your innovation and company.

To access feedback from the judges please log in at
www.omnicompete.com using the same details you provided when
registered to the Competition and then by clicking on My Dashboard.

A new opportunity

Now in its sixth year, the Global Security Challenge is officially
open for entries. Winners of this challenge benefit from cash grants
of US$500,000 courtesy of the US Department of Defense.

In addition to top-quality mentoring for the winners, every entrant
will receive expert feedback from the judges. The GSC judging panel
differs from the IFSEC judging panel, so we strongly encourage you to
enter.

Open to Start-ups and SMEs, full details of what the judges are
looking for can be found at
www.omnicompete.com &#226;&#65533;&#65533; hurry though, entry deadline is May 31st 2011.

Many thanks,

The GSC Team
OmniCompete
</PRE>
