<PRE>Colin -

I read this as follows:

1          Interesting approach, though I am not sure I fully
understand it. Is the not-for-profit linkage an issue ?

TRANSLATION: No market potential.

2          Useful concept, but limited feel for the market potential.

TRANSLATION: No market potential.

3          An unusual background to this entry. It clearly addresses a
&gt;<i> need but there must be competition in this space.
</I>

TRANSLATION: No market potential.

4          Historically, the intruder detection market has been a slow
&gt;<i> mover. Great to see developments proceeding here. Targeting the
</I>&gt;<i> architects will not hurt, either.
</I>

TRANSLATION: No market potential.

If they are looking for the&quot;next generation security
innovations to radically change the security world&quot; they clearly are not
judging in that basis - in fact, from what I read they are actually looking
for something they can capitalize on; which is an entirely different
motivation that &quot;next generation security innovations.&quot; Judge one even
thinks it is questionable to have published with OWASP!!!  In fact if you
look at the finalists they are all products!

We need innovative ideas like OWASP AppSensor which I fully believe is the
real next generation of security, it is a pattern for creating applications
that detect and respond to security events themselves. This is so cutting
edge it is practically science fiction - and OWASP even has a
reference implementation. Selling more security controls is doing the same
shit we have always done; is the same thinking that has us patching, praying
and upgrading all the time. How this qualifies as 'next generation security
innovation' is a complete mystery. In my world that is not security at all,
that is masturbation. Unfortunately, it seems to have been more of a circle
jerking contest, than it was about security.

No worries Colin, OWASP is about changing the world - your in the right
place doing the right things.

Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i> Hello, Colin !
</I>&gt;<i> Dear Entrant,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IFSEC results
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for applying to the IFSEC Future of Security Competition 2011.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Judging Committee has now reviewed all the submissions for the
</I>&gt;<i> Competition and unfortunately, your entry was not selected as a
</I>&gt;<i> finalist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The quality of the submitted ideas was extremely high and not being
</I>&gt;<i> selected as a finalist does not imply that the Judging Committee was
</I>&gt;<i> not impressed with your innovation and company.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To access feedback from the judges please log in at
</I>&gt;<i> www.omnicompete.com using the same details you provided when
</I>&gt;<i> registered to the Competition and then by clicking on My Dashboard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A new opportunity
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now in its sixth year, the Global Security Challenge is officially
</I>&gt;<i> open for entries. Winners of this challenge benefit from cash grants
</I>&gt;<i> of US$500,000 courtesy of the US Department of Defense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to top-quality mentoring for the winners, every entrant
</I>&gt;<i> will receive expert feedback from the judges. The GSC judging panel
</I>&gt;<i> differs from the IFSEC judging panel, so we strongly encourage you to
</I>&gt;<i> enter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Open to Start-ups and SMEs, full details of what the judges are
</I>&gt;<i> looking for can be found at
</I>&gt;<i> www.omnicompete.com &#226;&#65533;&#65533; hurry though, entry deadline is May 31st 2011.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks,
