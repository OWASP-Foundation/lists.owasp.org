Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] 2.1.0 branch update
Message-ID: <CAM8z=yKSoEHWvz7YzPfcL6+uL9Pi0s_+KdzicYMPbaZO_1xeFg@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Just pushed an update to the 2.1 branch (and released an associated maven
snapshot).

This push added a new execution mode:
- Kafka (http://kafka.apache.org/) - From the website ... "Apache Kafka is
publish-subscribe messaging rethought as a distributed commit log. Kafka is
[fast, scalable, durable, distributed by design]." Kafka is becoming
popular quickly in many organizations for many reasons, so now is a good
time to add support for it.

In addition, the following features have recently been added and will be
part of the 2.1 push coming up in 1-2 months (shooting for late may/early
june):
- integration -> JMX notifications
- integration -> CEF output over syslog
- execution mode -> rabbitmq
- general feature -> geolocation

The code for the branch is here if you're interested:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/tree/dev-v2.1 and/or you can get the
latest stable (2.0.x) and dev (2.1.0-SNAPSHOT) releases from maven central.

As always, please send in any feedback, and if you have questions or
interest on any of these items, let me know.

Thanks,
John

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Fwd: OWASP 2014 Annual Report - Call for
	Content
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBnLtbJSmJ1Ac0SuNGNQyCU6qZkOuTC-=5d0S+VWkiKf4A@mail.gmail.com>

Kate hartman has asked for contributions to the OWASP annual report, so I
think we should highlight AppSensor. I have drafted some text below. I
guess the 2014 report just covers 2104, but think we should mention
everything produced in the last 12 months to date, since many were largely
created in 2014. I drafted the text below and would welcome feedback:

---

In the last year OWASP's flagship AppSensor Project has published a series
of significant outputs to help raise awareness and adoption.
AppSensor defines a conceptual framework and methodology that offers
prescriptive guidance to implement application intrusion detection and
automated response and in addition, the project also provides a reference
implementation that allows developers to use these powerful concepts in
existing applications. Software architects and designers like the concept
when they learn of it, and it fits well with a DevOps mindset. The
difficulty has been spreading the idea. The new project outputs build upon
the contributions of over 40 volunteers from around the world named on the
project's wiki page, and have been created to share the knowledge and ideas
to a range of different audiences. The project team has produced a
microsite at www.appsensor.org, an introduction for developers in the form
of a two-sided flyer, a large-format publicity poster, a 12-page CISO
briefing, a 200+ page technical guide, and most recently a v2.0 reference
implementation. Furthermore two project leaders have been interviewed about
the project by Mark Miller for the OWASP Podcast. OWASP has provided the
platform for the team to work together and publish these vendor-neutral
outputs under open source licenses, and also provided funding through the
2012 project reboot initiative to pay for the printing and distribution of
flyers, posters and guides at meetings, conferences and other events. We
are beginning to see the AppSensor ideas, originally from 2008, beginning
to appear in security analysts' thoughts and also in new offerings in the
open source and vendor product spaces. Looking forward into 2015, v2.1 of
the reference implementation is expected by mid-sumemr and will include a
number of enhancements, including additional options for integration
enterprise security event management systems.

---

I thought we could send a screen grab of the large format poster (like page
1 of the developer leaflet but with the microsite URL instead of the "turn
over..." text) as the accompanying picture.

Fantastic!

2 very minor comments:
- In the next to last sentence, the word "beginning" is used 2 times -
maybe a typo?
- For 2015 go-forward, you could also highlight the plans for appseceu to
do community driven work on doc updates and tool dashboard design.
Thanks,
John

Thanks, yes those are good. Updated:

----

In the last year OWASP's flagship AppSensor Project has published a series
of significant outputs to help raise awareness and adoption.
AppSensor defines a conceptual framework and methodology that offers
prescriptive guidance to implement application intrusion detection and
automated response and in addition, the project also provides a reference
implementation that allows developers to use these powerful concepts in
existing applications. Software architects and designers like the concept
when they learn of it, and it fits well with a DevOps mindset. The
difficulty has been spreading the idea. The new project outputs build upon
the contributions of over 40 volunteers from around the world named on the
project's wiki page, and have been created to share the knowledge and ideas
to a range of different audiences. The project team has produced a
microsite at *www.appsensor.org* <http://www.appsensor.org/>, an
introduction for developers in the form of a two-sided flyer, a
large-format publicity poster, a 12-page CISO briefing, a 200+ page
technical guide, and most recently a v2.0 reference implementation.
Furthermore two project leaders have been interviewed about the project by
Mark Miller for the OWASP Podcast. OWASP has provided the platform for the
team to work together and publish these vendor-neutral outputs under open
source licenses, and also provided funding through the 2012 project reboot
initiative to pay for the printing and distribution of flyers, posters and
guides at meetings, conferences and other events. We are beginning to see
the AppSensor ideas, originally from 2008, starting to appear in security
analysts' thoughts and also in new offerings in the open source and vendor
product spaces. Looking forward into 2015, the project summit at AppSec EU
is being used to facilitate community driven work on documentation updates
and tool dashboard design. Also v2.1 of the reference implementation is
expected by mid-summer and will include a number of enhancements, including
additional options for integration enterprise security event management
systems.

Dear all

I have proof read and made some minor adjustments, and published a
final v2.0 PDF. This has the blank inside cover pages removed:

    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Appsensor-ciso-briefing.pdf

It is also on Lulu to buy in hardcopy:

    http://www.lulu.com/shop/owasp-foundation/appsensor-ciso-briefing/paperback/product-22121723.html

I have ordered a few copies of the latter to check it is completely correct.

Colin

Some news if there is space in a forthcoming OWASP Global Connector.

=========================

OWASP AppSensor

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project

=========================

AppSensor is about detecting and responding to attacks within software
applications. In February the project team created a two-page flyer
"AppSensor - Introduction for Developers":

    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Appsensor_intro_for_developers.pdf

And now in April, a new 12-page booklet "AppSensor - CISO Briefing"
has also been finalised:

    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Appsensor-ciso-briefing.pdf

The CISO Briefing is also available to buy at cost in hardcopy:

    http://www.lulu.com/shop/owasp-foundation/appsensor-ciso-briefing/paperback/product-22121723.html

These materials are intended to complement the more extended
information on the microsite http://www.appsensor.org/, project wiki
and "AppSensor - Guide". AppSensor is participating in the project
summit at AppSec EU in May.

I have received my order from Lulu. The printed Lulu versions are
correct, so feel free to mention/promote these now.

Hello

Does anyone on this list know any of the members of this panel at RSA next week?

    Practical Advice for Embracing RASP - A New Kind of Defense
    https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us15/agenda/sessions/1980/practical-advice-for-embracing-rasp-a-new-kind-of?es_p=368947

If so, would you be able to put a copy of the AppSensor CISO Briefing
in their mailbox, or a Lulu copy in their hands, before the 22nd?

All,

Louis pointed out this presentation from RSAC yesterday:
https://www.rsaconference.com/writable/presentations/file_upload/asd-w01-countering-development-environment-attacks.pdf
. It talks about appsensor as a modern defense mechanism

Just saw this press release for a new product offering:
https://www.immun.io/press.html . It appears to be appsensor implemented as
an agent product (ie. newrelic). [note: I'm not endorsing it at all, just
mentioning - all I've heard about it is the press release]

Looks like there's a lot of mindshare in this space right now. Exciting
time to be working in this area!

Thanks,
John
