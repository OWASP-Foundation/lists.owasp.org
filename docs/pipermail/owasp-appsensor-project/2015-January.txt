Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] v2.0.0-RC3 released
Message-ID: <CAM8z=yKTHPQfr=QJFuCyja7LYYg+fQaMbw0za-7xwFbU0rnrwA@mail.gmail.com>

All,

We just released 2.0.0-RC3. This is the third (and planned final) release
candidate for 2.0.0 final.  More info is here:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/releases/tag/v2.0.0-RC3

This was an update to address issues in the SOAP web service. Many thanks
to Juan Calderon for finding the issue and helping me resolve it.

Unless there are significant bugs that come up, we plan on a v2 final going
out in mid-late January. This is a delay from the planned date at the end
of 2014, but this issue was important enough to resolve before 2.0.

As always, happy to hear any feedback.

Thanks,
John

Well done John and other code/website contributors

I did get round to downloading RC2 before Christmas and was hoping to
try hooking it into an application that is already instrumented. But
other things have got in the way, and I haven't progressed very far
with it. It is on my list....

Regards

Colin

Dear all

We have about $4,000 unused funds allocated to the project.

   https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&key=0Atu4kyR3ljftdEdQWTczbUxoMUFnWmlTODZ2ZFZvaXc&hl=en_US&gid=3

These primarily relate to reboot funding requested to help the
publication of the v2 AppSensor Guide.

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects_Reboot_2012_-_OWASP_AppSensor

Most volunteers have not requested their own free printed copy (maybe
5 took up the free offer), and the project leaders have not gone over
board with buying them from Lulu for presentations either (maybe 100
copies). We haven't created a flyer.

So maybe we should now consider returning this back to OWASP for its
general funds. Or should we get some printed for the LatAm tour, or
the upcoming appsec conferences? We don't have enough money for all
attendees of these.

Does anyone have any thoughts?

Colin

Is there some way that $4000 can be spent to spread awareness about AppSensor?

Jim

Maybe, but that wasn't quite what the Reboot funding was allocated
for. So I assumed that if we can't use it for the intended purpose, it
should be returned to the central funds.

The core mission per our bylaws is spreading awareness, so I feel
using those reboot funds for awareness purposes is very much
acceptable. Perhaps spend the money to put John on the road to talk
about 2.0?

My 2 cents (regarding 4k),

Just an idea on how you can spread awareness on appsensor v2.

Use some of the money to rent a server somewhere.
Setup a tor hidden service running a vulnerable sample app setup with
appsensor.

Invite people on reddit,hackernews and slashdot to attack the sample app.

Include the results of this experiment in a presentation at next
security conference.

Just my two cents.

Regards.
Timo.

My view is that is up to the project leaders to decide (and be creative) on
where to use these funds

As long as it is project specific, we need to trust the leaders to do the
right thing (which they tend to do)

If you want some rules engagement , see the GSD project (which already has
a couple nice success stories).

Just be proactive and use the money. Think of it as unused potential, which
would be a shame to miss

While it doesn't fit the original reason for requesting the money, my first
wish from the technical side would be to get some design help for a
management console and dashboard. If that's a skill someone is willing to
donate, I'd be thrilled. If we need to pay for it, I think it'd be a
benefit to the tooling.

Another couple possibilities I thought of that would probably fit much more
inline with the original goal of the book:
- Translation of the v2 book into different languages
- Marketing "slicks" or infographics based on the book

As to whether or not we can re-purpose the money for other things, is there
a decision authority? I don't want to be dishonest about it, but I do think
the money would be well-used in the project on a number of ideas. Is this
something that should be asked of the board or some group within OWASP?

Reboot funds are to reboot the project, it's super generic - all of the

donate, I'd be thrilled. If we need to pay for it, I think it'd be a
benefit to the tooling.

Another couple possibilities I thought of that would probably fit much more
inline with the original goal of the book:
- Translation of the v2 book into different languages
- Marketing "slicks" or infographics based on the book

As to whether or not we can re-purpose the money for other things, is there
a decision authority? I don't want to be dishonest about it, but I do think
the money would be well-used in the project on a number of ideas. Is this
something that should be asked of the board or some group within OWASP?

John/Timo
If you decide to go this ELK route, I could mock up some dashboard layouts based on:

1. ELK's capabilities

2. Knowing what AppSensor code 2 can do

Thanks Timo - that's really nice. I'll have a look at using the ELK stack and see how much is involved with getting it setup.

I like all these ideas. Maybe we can come up with a proposal for the best use of the funds, and then go back to the board to check they are happy for the extended/modified use. We did have the funds taken away in 2013 for non-use, but Eoin helped allocate them back again.

While it doesn't fit the original reason for requesting the money, my first wish from the technical side would be to get some design help for a management console and dashboard. If that's a skill someone is willing to donate, I'd be thrilled. If we need to pay for it, I think it'd be a benefit to the tooling. 

Another couple possibilities I thought of that would probably fit much more inline with the original goal of the book:
- Translation of the v2 book into different languages
- Marketing "slicks" or infographics based on the book

As to whether or not we can re-purpose the money for other things, is there a decision authority? I don't want to be dishonest about it, but I do think the money would be well-used in the project on a number of ideas. Is this something that should be asked of the board or some group within OWASP?

Just an idea on how you can spread awareness on appsensor v2.



Use some of the money to rent a server somewhere.

Setup a tor hidden service running a vulnerable sample app setup with

appsensor.



Invite people on reddit,hackernews and slashdot to attack the sample app.



Include the results of this experiment in a presentation at next

security conference.



Just my two cents.



Regards.

Timo.

Sounds great - happy to do this. Do you have a good format or are you
planning just an email? Let me know and I'll put something together and
send it over to you for review.

I'm gonna start reading the docs for Elastic search, can't guarantee
that I will get very far and will be able to help but maybe in the near
future I can try help out with the dashboard when I'm on leave again.

John
Yes, just an email. Maybe we send the final version to Kate and ask for it to be raised at the next Board meeting?

Maybe we need to explain why we under spent, and perhaps be less specific in the future usage, but putting a time cap on that night be a reasonable constraint on us.

I like all these ideas. Maybe we can come up with a proposal for the best use of the funds, and then go back to the board to check they are happy for the extended/modified use. We did have the funds taken away in 2013 for non-use, but Eoin helped allocate them back again.

While it doesn't fit the original reason for requesting the money, my first wish from the technical side would be to get some design help for a management console and dashboard. If that's a skill someone is willing to donate, I'd be thrilled. If we need to pay for it, I think it'd be a benefit to the tooling. 

Another couple possibilities I thought of that would probably fit much more inline with the original goal of the book:
- Translation of the v2 book into different languages
- Marketing "slicks" or infographics based on the book

As to whether or not we can re-purpose the money for other things, is there a decision authority? I don't want to be dishonest about it, but I do think the money would be well-used in the project on a number of ideas. Is this something that should be asked of the board or some group within OWASP?

Hash: SHA1



Just an idea on how you can spread awareness on appsensor v2.



Use some of the money to rent a server somewhere.

Setup a tor hidden service running a vulnerable sample app setup with

appsensor.



Invite people on reddit,hackernews and slashdot to attack the sample app.



Include the results of this experiment in a presentation at next

security conference.



Just my two cents.



Regards.

Timo.

One of the problems we have with OWASP finances is - folks are not 
spending money for projects and chapters. We have well over 500,000$ in 
the bank in reserve for chapters and projects.

I am grateful for the level of integrity you are all bringing to this 
topic, but please understand that if you use the money for spreading 
awareness about this project, you are bulls-eye in the center of how we 
are all tasked to spend these funds.

By all means get approval, but I just wanted to put that message out there.

Aloha,
Jim

All,

Wanted to point out an interesting talk for any that might be going to
appsec California next week: http://sched.co/27Wv

I would love to hear feedback if anyone attends. The description references
appsensor, but says they took a significantly different approach based on
learning and behavior modeling.

Thanks,
John

Ms Yang is a brilliant researcher and I intend to listen to this talk. I
wonder how they ensure that they are really measuring "safe" baseline app
and user activity? I'll give you a report next week, John.

Fantastic - yes, I'm really excited to see this kind of approach.
Salesforce has a great team so I have high expectations!

Message-ID: <CAM8z=y+9njD2DNs5aaBs3PcEYHWTjAWApLHDwW7XLnO0-eyzhA@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I'm happy to announce that appsensor version 2.0.0 (final) has been
released.

Note: This is a code release, which comes after a recent (summer 2014) of
version 2 of the appsensor book [see quick downloads at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project for a link to the
latest version of the book].

The release information is published here:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/releases/tag/v2.0.0

AppSensor has gone through a complete re-write from the previous version
(1.x). Below are the major updates that were most important (and requested)
in v2.

* Client-server architecture supporting multiple communication modes
including: REST, SOAP, Thrift, local (shared JVM, java-only)

* Any language can be used on the client application. The only requirement
is that the language selected must support the communication protocol of
the execution mode that is configured (ie. if using REST as the execution
mode, the language must be capable of making HTTP requests.) The
server-side components are Java, but this places no restriction on the
client applications themselves.

* There is no longer a hard dependency on ESAPI. AppSensor is a standalone
project, though it can be integrated with projects that also use ESAPI if
desired.

* The core components of the system have been renamed and now follow the
appsensor v2 book naming conventions, which is based on standard IDS
terminology for clarity.

* Basic user correlation is supported so that client applications that
share a user base (SSO) can share attack detection/response information.

* A website for the project has been built (appsensor.org).

Many thanks to all those who contributed. Contributors to the overall
project are at [
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project#tab=Acknowledgements]
and contributors to the v2 code are at [
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/graphs/contributors]. We also had
many wonderful alpha and beta testers, and I am extremely grateful for all
their feedback in making a better product.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
John

Timo

Thanks for the idea and feedback. Michael's video demos use the old
code and would be worth re-developing. Hopefully John's new website
content will help people get started:

   http://www.appsensor.org/getting-started.html

I have added it to the forward plan wish list at

Fabio

That would be useful. I will do an update to the Guide to reflect
John's new code, but maybe after that we can add it to Crowdin.

Thanks Juan - and thank you for all the assistance in getting the v2 bugs
worked out - a huge help.
