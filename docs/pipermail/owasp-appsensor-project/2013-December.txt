Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Detection points for IP-address and user
	agent
Message-ID: <CAHnknQVoBNKtNFW0vPqEKh4K3fDwkaHVgzF-NL8XDHZ3cqUKWA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I was wondering whether anyone has looked into detection points for
IP-address and user agent.
While running this on a test site, I experienced the IP-address changing
benignly due to the use of clustered outgoing proxies, and user agents
changing during downloads of PDFs. The user agent changed between IE and
Chrome Frame, IE also sends "Contype" as user agent when a PDF is
downloaded from the Adobe Reader plugin. Similar things happen for Safari
and other browsers. On Windows 8, the word "touch" also sometimes appears
in the user agent and sometimes not.
This makes it hard to use these detection points for anything useful
without maintaining a seemingly fragile set of rules.

Best regards
Erlend

Yes, we run into similar issues with the ModSecurity CRS.  When implementing
these AppSensor Detection Points ? we opted to check each one of these
individually and they would raise an alert for "suspicious" behaviour but
only if BOTH IP netblock and UA changing would result in a malicious client
designation (for potential Session Hijacking).

This is good information we should add as notes to these detection points.
Sometimes the simple rule doesn't work in practice. I will say that in some
of the apps I've worked on, a user-agent or IP changing would have alone
been a good indicator of suspicious activity. These things will obviously
vary depending upon environment.

Hello AppSensor Team,

Please see below. This is the message I received from HOST. Apologies for
not sending this earlier. I have out of the office.

Essentially, I provided additional information about the project plan,
expenses, technical lead information, etc. to the HOST team. They are
currently delayed due to administrative processes they have to go through
on the federal government side. This is no surprise to me so don't stress.
They take some time to send/process payment.

I don't believe we will hear anything until the second week of January
after the holidays. Let me know if you need more information, Team.

SG

 Samantha,
I hope this email finds you well.  Just wanted to check in with you to let
you know where we stand.

The info you provided has been submitted to the GT contracting office,
however processes on the Federal Government side are creating delays in
HOST funding.  Unfortunately this will push out the anticipated date of
your contract with Georgia Tech.  Furthermore, given that the holiday
season is upon us, mid-to-late January 2014 is a more likely time frame to
anticipate completion.

I apologize for the inconvenience and please know we're doing everything we
can to push the process along. Nevertheless, I am thrilled to have you on
our team and we'll formalize the arrangement soon.

Take care and don't hesitate to contact me.

It's only 3 days old! I wouldn't worry too much.

Good, so we are waiting for them.
