Tom?s,

Thanks for the email and I'm excited to see your interest in AppSensor. I'm
adding in the appsensor project list so you can get feedback from many more
individuals working on AppSensor.

Thanks!

Tom?s,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm going to try and give a few thoughts here:

- We try to help support any related projects we can, and have worked with
students on a number of occasions to extend the project successfully.

- One of the extensions done by a former student was to add a rules-based
analysis engine. This engine allows more complex rules to be formed, and
provides a more precise and flexible model for detecting specific attacks.

- Generally, the goal for appsensor is to collect relatively few events.
The idea is that "suspicious" or "malicious" events should be relatively
small relative to normal usage if you have appropriate security controls in
place (an explicit assumption of the appsensor model). Having said that,
folks have used appsensor in a number of different ways, and at times for
larger data sets. I'm not aware of anyone using it for data sets large
enough to require hadoop, or more generally, the "big data" ecosystem.

- This summer, we're actually working with a student who is building both
simple statistical and machine learning based approaches for detecting
suspicious behavior in web server logs. Certainly web server logs can be
large depending upon the environment. Though these are not the standard
appsensor data input format, it's still an interesting problem, and serves
to help the same users of our project, primarily developers and security
professionals.

- Lastly, if you let me know what kind of documentation you would like, I
can try and help. Generally we either point people to the user guide, or
the website: appsensor.org

Hope this helps, and please reach out with any questions or further
discussion.

Thanks,
John

Hi John, Michael,

Thanks for your quick reply. When I read the AppSensor guide, I assumed
that big data could be an interesting development for the project, because
in this paragraph of the guide, the following is detailed:

 John, you say:

Generally, the goal for appsensor is to collect relatively few events.


And this has confused me. I don't know if my research line could be
interesting for the AppSensor project (I hope so..!), but anyway, I would
like to know if you consider that there is any line of work for AppSensor
improvement that can be started (since currently, I can still change the
line of my research).

Thanks again for your help,
Tom?s

Thanks Tom?s, you're right that is very confusing! I suppose I might
restate it in this way. AppSensor is not a log analytics solution, and
doesn't try to be. It collects interesting/suspicious security events (or
possibly attacks). If you have a significant amount of traffic, this could
result in large amounts of data.

Having said that, one problem we have in AppSensor is that since the data
collected by the system is security-sensitive, we generally have the
problem that no one is willing to share data. We don't have any data sets
you could use in your analysis, and I think that would make your project
difficult. This is the reason we built some analysis this summer around web
server logs, as those tend to be much easier to get access to.

I'd love for you to work on the project. Having said that, you'll
definitely need a way to generate the data you need, as we don't have data
we can share with you.

Thanks,
John

John,
Just a thought...set up a honeypot with an application that uses AppSensor
and collect those logs for later public analytics. It should be okay to
share that data.
