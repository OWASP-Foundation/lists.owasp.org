<PRE>John and Giri
I have some notes from the past about CEF and Appsensor, but they are in the v2 guide too. pp55-56, 123-124, 131, and especially 165-167.

I also blogged last week about a couple of related ENISA reports:

Got it John!

I may be wrong, but here is one thought I have to eliminate this confusion about tools and their required formats. While integration, most of the teams/applications may not be able to directly consume the messages. They (consuming application team) any way need to write adapters, so my guess is CEF should be fine, because it is well known format for event notifications.

Thank you,
Giri

Ok, great. I think there's a straightforward notification mechanism in JMX we could use that shouldn't be too much trouble. 

As for your larger question, I want to support what people need. If that's JMX, that's fine. My guess is that the largest need throughout the industry would be to have the data in some structured format that's parseable into their tool of choice. As Louis mentioned, some people will want to use the UI we build, but many enterprises are going to use whatever tool they have in house that already manages this data. If we can send data out in CEF format, for instance, and your tool consumes CEF, then we're good. What I don't know right now is what tools most people use and what their preferred formats are. I imagine over the long run we want to build a number of these output integrations, but I want to prioritize them as needed.

Thanks,
John

Hi John,

JMX notifications is what I am looking for (domain we are working is related to monitoring).&#160;
As I think more, I think managing through JMX might not be that much critical requirement because major cases out put of Appsensor is important rather than configuring/managing AppSensor through JMX (Unless I mis-understood your question).

Feel free to correct me.

Thank you,
Giri

Hi Giri,
I should clarify here. Are you looking for JMX notifications or the ability to manage appsensor via JMX. Obviously different levels of effort, but want to make sure I'm understanding the use case. What is the goal?
Thanks,
John

Thanks for considering our input John!
In my case, we are looking for JMX (OR) SNMP. Leaning more towards JMX first.&#160;

Thank you,
Giri

Ok, extremely valuable feedback. I actually wouldn't have thought that to be the highest priority, but it makes sense. Do y'all have a specific list of integration points that would be helpful in your environments? We can get those ticketed / queued up, and added as specific data points for the GSOC project descriptions.

Hi,&#160;From my point of view I also think &#8220;enterprise integration&#8221; should be top priority, the dashboard UI would be nice and trend monitoring as well but if AppSensor is integrated with other enterprise tools that already have dashboard and trend monitoring then there is no need to re-invent the wheel.&#160;Louis&#160;From: <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-appsensor-project">owasp-appsensor-project-bounces at lists.owasp.org</A> [mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-appsensor-project">owasp-appsensor-project-bounces at lists.owasp.org</A>] On Behalf Of John Melton

Wanted to send out a quick note to get everyone's opinions on what would be good candidate projects for GSOC 2015. Please note: these have to be code-related (can't be pure documentation) I've listed a few ideas below - please add any you can think of:
- dashboard UI 
- trend monitoring analysis engine
- &quot;enterprise integrations&quot; - a collection of integration points related to either reporting (snmp, jmx, syslog, cef, etc.) and/or transport mechanisms (message queues, avro, protobuf, etc.)
&#160;
Also, if you would like to volunteer to be a mentor, please also let me know.

Thanks,
John
