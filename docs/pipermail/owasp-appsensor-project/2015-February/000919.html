<PRE>All,

I just pushed some changes to a new 2.1 branch. This is where development
will continue for the next couple of months, so if you're interested in the
latest, feel free to check it out. In addition to the 2.0.1 stable release
that just happened, there's also a 2.1.0 snapshot release available as
well. Both of these should be on maven central in the next couple of hours.

The new branch has a couple of main changes initially:

- geolocation - the concept of geolocation has been added with an initial
implementation for the maxmind geoip2 database, though you can plug in
whatever provider you'd like. This allows us to enrich the data set we're
collecting (if desired).

- rabbitmq execution mode - this adds an initial capability for message
queue based delivery. This decoupled model is important in many
organizations. There are various implementations I hope to support, and
rabbitmq is the first one in place.

The code for the new branch is here if you're interested:
<A HREF="https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/tree/dev-v2.1">https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/tree/dev-v2.1</A>

Final note: In addition to the changes above and others to come in 2.1 (see
<A HREF="https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/issues">https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/issues</A>), we have submitted some
projects to the GSOC proposal for OWASP (
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSoC2015_Ideas">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSoC2015_Ideas</A>). Hopefully we can get one
or more projects done this summer. Some of that work may go against the 2.1
branch depending on the timeline, so stay tuned.

As always, please send in any feedback, and if you have questions or
interest on any of these items, let me know.

Thanks,
John
