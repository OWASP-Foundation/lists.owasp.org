thank you very much for your answers.

I'll try the HMAC approach it seems to be reliable and easy implemented.

Coming from someone who excels at black text on a white page design, I
think it looks great!
Thanks,

Really good. Is it a wasp-eating frog by any chance?

AppSensor Team,

I'm thrilled we have two of our top notch AppSensor leaders interested in
taking over project leadership!  Outlined below is the process I'll follow
to select our next project leader.

The process:
1. John & Dennis send me responses to 3 questions (see forwarded email)
[done]
2. I'll publish the answers (verbatim) to the appsensor mailing list [done]
and ask for feedback [in progress]
3. I'll make a call based on all the info and feedback
4. We'll all continue making AppSensor awesome

We're on step 2. The responses are located here:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project/ProjectLeaderStatement-JohnMelton
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project/ProjectLeaderStatement-DennisGroves

If anyone on the list has feedback or opinions then please send them
directly to me for consideration.


Thanks!

Dennis & John,

Thank you both for your interest in taking on the leadership of AppSensor.

First, either of you would do an awesome job. And while it would be easy to
just say you are both the project leaders, I think it's important for us to
have a single point of contact and leadership and then an army of awesome
volunteers & experts.

To help choose our next project leader could you please respond to me with
the following questions?

The process:
1. Each of you sends me your responses
2. I'll publish your answers (verbatim) to the appsensor mailing list and
ask for feedback
3. I'll make a call based on all the info and feedback
4. We'll all continue making AppSensor awesome


Questions

1. What do you want to do with the AppSensor project?
2. Do you feel you have sufficient time to tackle leadership of this
project?
3. Why are you a good choice to lead AppSensor?



Thanks!

Why don't we have both?

As I write in The difference between being 'Appointed' and being 'Accepted'
as an OWASP Leader (of its
Fork)<http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/the-difference-between-being-appointed.html>
the
last thing we want is to lose energy and focus of somebody motivated to
contribute on a project.

At this stage I wouldn't want to chose one of the other (specially since it
might work great with both working side-by-side).

Btw, I will try to add AppSensor-like-capabilities to the project I'm
working at the moment (TeamMentor), which is a .NET app, with live
deployments and a real need to detect malicious activities, and defend
itself.
