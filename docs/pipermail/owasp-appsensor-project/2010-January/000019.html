<PRE>Glad to hear the good thoughts. I am certainly behind this project and
would like to see it succeed.

 

I agree, it would take some initial code. However, the demo at
<A HREF="http://defendtheapp.com">http://defendtheapp.com</A> leverages a large amount of code from esapi. I
basically built 3 or 4 classes to extend a few things and that was it.
I'd be happy to make that code available. We'd need to clean it up a bit
since its just in proof of concept style, but it all works great.  What
do you think if we were to make the framework code available (esapi.jar
plus 4 classes) and provide the samples of how to do the detection
points (3-4 lines of code plus the appropriate intrusion detection
call)?

 

Roadmap:

It is a weak little roadmap.  I'm looking for more interested people to
help with this project.  I think we have a lot of good ideas and need to
find a way to push them forward.

 

Regarding your comment on a rules engine. That was probably from slide
34 of this presentation:

<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/images/0/06/Defend_Yourself-Integrating_Real_Time_D">http://www.owasp.org/images/0/06/Defend_Yourself-Integrating_Real_Time_D</A>
efenses_into_Online_Applications-Michael_Coates.pdf

One of my sample implementations for detection of application based
worms was to define rules within the Drools rule based engine.

Thanks for the response.  Not to laud you too much, but I think the
project is queued for success.  I think the mix of the timing (w/
regards to real events in the community) along with the significant
effort put into the project (excellent documentation with clear
descriptions of event types) could make it a big win for some
applications.  

My one dissent would be that I think it will require at least some code
to get initial uptake.  Obviously the low hanging fruit would make
sense, if there are some simple rules to implement.  My thought is most
developers will use a project if it gives them something tactical today.
They may also contribute back if they like the project.  Are there any
plans along these lines for the project currently?  Is there a roadmap?
I only see what's on the OWASP site for documentation about where the
project is going, which seems thin at the moment.  My thought is most of
those discussions are happening on this list, which I've only recently
joined.

On a somewhat related note, I can't find it in the book, but I could
swear I read somewhere at some point something about a rules engine, or
maybe a diagram with that in it in reference to implementing the trend
monitoring ... am I off base here?  That's the reason I was thinking
there was code out there somewhere.

Yep, no code right now. It's all about the methodology and concept of
detecting and responding to attacks in the application.  Ultimately the
code would be unique to an individual application, but it wouldn't be
hard for us to provide samples of how to integrate into esapi or provide
sample code for each detection point.

 

It sounds like this would be useful to you and others and help the
adoption of AppSensor concepts.

New to this list, so sorry if this is out of place.  I looked at
appsensor a bit ago, but couldn't find any code ... just checked and
still couldn't.  As for the book, I thought it was very good, but code
examples would probably go a long way to helping most devs.

Clever idea. I like it.

I have a different question though. How do we keep managing this
project? The first approach was to create the pdf/book with all of the
information.  But now I'm feeling that it might be easier to maintain if
all of the detection points are in the wiki. Then people can update and
add as they see fit?

Any thoughts?  For that matter, any feedback on the book itself? Should
we put out another version? What's missing? Do you want to see code
examples?

I was rummaging around some ModSecurity discussions and noticed this:


<A HREF="http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/modsecurity/apache/feature_content_i">http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/modsecurity/apache/feature_content_i</A>
njection.html#id281488

i%0Anjection.html#id281488&gt; 

concerning sending a payload back to an attacker, to determine their
real IP address.  So perhaps another sensor position is one deployed
dynamically (by the application) on the client.  Some non-IT examples
of this would be:

- deploying an airplane to take a closer look at another ship
approaching an aircraft carrier, to find out more information about
the potential threat
- using a manual hydrocarbon detection instrument in a refinery, if
someone reports a smell of gas, to determine if there really is a
problem

The appsensor is getting more complex, but cleverer.
