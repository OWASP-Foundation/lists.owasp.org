<PRE>Clever idea. I like it.

I have a different question though. How do we keep managing this
project? The first approach was to create the pdf/book with all of the
information.  But now I'm feeling that it might be easier to maintain if
all of the detection points are in the wiki. Then people can update and
add as they see fit?

Any thoughts?  For that matter, any feedback on the book itself? Should
we put out another version? What's missing? Do you want to see code
examples?

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Another Sensor Location Idea -
Deployedat the client as the threat level increases
Importance: High

I was rummaging around some ModSecurity discussions and noticed this:

 
<A HREF="http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/modsecurity/apache/feature_content_i">http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/modsecurity/apache/feature_content_i</A>
njection.html#id281488

concerning sending a payload back to an attacker, to determine their
real IP address.  So perhaps another sensor position is one deployed
dynamically (by the application) on the client.  Some non-IT examples
of this would be:

- deploying an airplane to take a closer look at another ship
approaching an aircraft carrier, to find out more information about
the potential threat
- using a manual hydrocarbon detection instrument in a refinery, if
someone reports a smell of gas, to determine if there really is a
problem

The appsensor is getting more complex, but cleverer.
