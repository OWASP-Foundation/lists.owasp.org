<PRE>Yep, no code right now. It's all about the methodology and concept of
detecting and responding to attacks in the application.  Ultimately the
code would be unique to an individual application, but it wouldn't be
hard for us to provide samples of how to integrate into esapi or provide
sample code for each detection point.

 

It sounds like this would be useful to you and others and help the
adoption of AppSensor concepts.

New to this list, so sorry if this is out of place.  I looked at
appsensor a bit ago, but couldn't find any code ... just checked and
still couldn't.  As for the book, I thought it was very good, but code
examples would probably go a long way to helping most devs.

Clever idea. I like it.

I have a different question though. How do we keep managing this
project? The first approach was to create the pdf/book with all of the
information.  But now I'm feeling that it might be easier to maintain if
all of the detection points are in the wiki. Then people can update and
add as they see fit?

Any thoughts?  For that matter, any feedback on the book itself? Should
we put out another version? What's missing? Do you want to see code
examples?

I was rummaging around some ModSecurity discussions and noticed this:


<A HREF="http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/modsecurity/apache/feature_content_i">http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/modsecurity/apache/feature_content_i</A>
njection.html#id281488

i%0Anjection.html#id281488&gt; 

concerning sending a payload back to an attacker, to determine their
real IP address.  So perhaps another sensor position is one deployed
dynamically (by the application) on the client.  Some non-IT examples
of this would be:

- deploying an airplane to take a closer look at another ship
approaching an aircraft carrier, to find out more information about
the potential threat
- using a manual hydrocarbon detection instrument in a refinery, if
someone reports a smell of gas, to determine if there really is a
problem

The appsensor is getting more complex, but cleverer.
