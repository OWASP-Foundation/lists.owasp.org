<PRE>Thanks for the response.  Not to laud you too much, but I think the project
is queued for success.  I think the mix of the timing (w/ regards to real
events in the community) along with the significant effort put into the
project (excellent documentation with clear descriptions of event types)
could make it a big win for some applications.

My one dissent would be that I think it will require at least some code to
get initial uptake.  Obviously the low hanging fruit would make sense, if
there are some simple rules to implement.  My thought is most developers
will use a project if it gives them something tactical today.  They may also
contribute back if they like the project.  Are there any plans along these
lines for the project currently?  Is there a roadmap?  I only see what's on
the OWASP site for documentation about where the project is going, which
seems thin at the moment.  My thought is most of those discussions are
happening on this list, which I've only recently joined.

On a somewhat related note, I can't find it in the book, but I could swear I
read somewhere at some point something about a rules engine, or maybe a
diagram with that in it in reference to implementing the trend monitoring
... am I off base here?  That's the reason I was thinking there was code out
there somewhere.

</I>&gt;<i> I was rummaging around some ModSecurity discussions and noticed this:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/modsecurity/apache/feature_content_i">http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/modsecurity/apache/feature_content_i</A>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> concerning sending a payload back to an attacker, to determine their
</I>&gt;<i> real IP address.  So perhaps another sensor position is one deployed
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically (by the application) on the client.  Some non-IT examples
</I>&gt;<i> of this would be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - deploying an airplane to take a closer look at another ship
</I>&gt;<i> approaching an aircraft carrier, to find out more information about
</I>&gt;<i> the potential threat
</I>&gt;<i> - using a manual hydrocarbon detection instrument in a refinery, if
</I>&gt;<i> someone reports a smell of gas, to determine if there really is a
</I>&gt;<i> problem
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The appsensor is getting more complex, but cleverer.
