<PRE>Michael and John

In some ways it's good the AppSensor hasn't been cast fully into code,
as it means it's easier to add ideas and extensions without worrying
too much about how it might be implemented.  That said, I can see the
advantage of having code snippets.

Perhaps the difficulty of integrating with something like EASPI is
that it begins to tie the two projects together and i think there is
scope for AppSensor separate to that.  Every modification to EASPI
might mean AppSensor has to be updated.

The book is great, and maybe another version would be useful some time
this year.

Wiki pages might be useful, and this could be where code examples are
added?  I think if as much as possible is language independent, it'll
help the continued growth.  Implementations can then just reference
the spec.  Drools sounds interesting.

Perhaps defining a suggested database structure for collecting the
events, allowing trend analysis and checking thresholds would be
useful to go along with the sensor specs.
