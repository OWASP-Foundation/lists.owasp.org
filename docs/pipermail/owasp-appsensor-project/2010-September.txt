 All,

If you are using AppSensor code or AppSensor ideas (e.g. detection point
concepts in your own code) then please send me an email (no need to copy
the list).  I'll be presenting next week at OWASP AppSecUSA and I'd like
to highlight current users of AppSensor.

Thanks!

 I'd like to centralize our AppSensor development documentation into a
single document here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_Developer_Guide

I copied over the information from the Getting Started Guide
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_GettingStarted) and marked it
for deletion. 

I think its best to have a single page where we can point people to
developer related information.

I have now created a page for response actions:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_ResponseActions

in a similar style to the detection points.  It links to the PDF.  The
wiki won't let me upload the source file in ODT format, and I think
the file size (50k) is too big to send to the list.  If anyone wants
the source file, let me know and I'll email it directly.

The new page is categorised "OWASP AppSensor Project" so is already
linked from the foot of the main project page.

Nice work Colin, looks great!

I wanted to recommend a new response action - proxy.  In ModSecurity, users
can selectively trigger the proxy action (
http://www.modsecurity.org/documentation/modsecurity-apache/2.5.12/modsecuri
ty2-apache-reference.html#N11A5A) which will send the request to a different
back-end location.  This is mostly used to send suspicious requests to a
honeypot system that closely mimics production but may have a more
sand-boxed environment for fraud detection.

Not sure if this would be considered SILENT or PASSIVE.  As opposed to the
Redirect action, which sends a 302 and Location header, the proxy action is
transparent to the user.

Michael,

I was impressed with your talk at the OWASP conference in Irvine.  I talked
to you after your presentation.  I mentioned that I have an idea or concept
that I would like to see added to the wish list for the AppSensor project.
  I don?t know if this idea is doable, but I thought that I would at least
throw it out there and see.  I am not a developer, but I have been working
in IT and networking for almost 30 years and see a real need to be able to
redirect an incoming session based on triggers.  My first thought was that
AppSensor might be the first tool that I have seen that might be able to
identify a session, and possibly request the session to be redirected based
on a trigger.

I have had this idea floating in my head for a while.  What I would like to
see is a method to redirect an obvious bad user (an attacker) to another
system, such as a honey pot or a system that can handle such an attack,
while keeping the session totally transparent from the attacker.

What I am thinking is once a set of events are triggered, the AppSensor can
initiate or trigger a re-direction of a session to another web server.   This
could be as simple as having a load balancer accept a re-direction request
(assuming that a load balancer could accept such a request), or something
within the application can automatically redirect the session to another web
server.

The main purpose to redirect a session is to relive the main web server(s)
from the attack.  The secondary benefit would be that there is a set of
servers that are focused for this type of abuse and could gather more
detailed logging for analysis.

And an obvious third benefit would be that the additional detailed knowledge
of the attack could also benefit the AppSensor researchers.

Anyway, I don?t know how doable this idea of session redirection is, but I
thought that I would at least share the idea that I had?

I would be curious in what you thought and if this would even be possible?

Anyway, thank you for listening?

Best regards,

Don Thomas

I read this last night, and was attracted to the idea, but thought I'd
sleep on it before replying!

A redirect action which sends a 302 and Location header, might fall
into "ASR-G: Process Terminated".

On the alternative proxying, my categorisation of SILENT vs PASSIVE vs
ACTIVE relates to "from the user's perspective" (not the
server/application's perspective).  I need to make that clearer on the
wiki.  So if the user were unaware of the proxying, I would say
SILENT.

However, your suggestion raises the issue of the "application" scope.
If we said the scope excluded things like network firewalls, the file
system, the operating system, the web server, the application server
and the database i.e. just the application code, then a WAF might be
external to the application.  So in an imaginary implementation, where
AppSensor wants to divert the user to a proxy, the action is
undertaken by something else (other than the application).

This might already be included in a combination of the following
response actions:

ASR-D: User Status Change (the user's session is marked as possibly malevolent)
ASR-B: Administrator Notification (an email alert is sent somewhere)
ASR-C: Other Notification (a message is sent to some network device to
proxy future requests from this user to the honeypot)

AppSensor might subsequently receive data from the honeypot in some
way (e.g. detection point RP2: Suspicious External User Behavior)
which could be used for monitoring, or (I'm dreaming here) determine
to signal the WAF to cancel the proxy and allow the user back to the
real system if it was a false alarm.

So my question is, can an application do the proxying, or is that some
other device AppSensor signals?  And I suppose, is "ModSecurity" part
of the application or something else?

What do you think?

 Don,

Thanks for your email and I'm glad you enjoyed the talk at Irvine. 
Colin Watson will be hosting an AppSensor talk at AppSec DC. His talk is
focusing on defining an AppSensor implementation strategy. It should be
really good. Make sure to stop by if you happen to be at that event :)

Regarding your idea, this is definitely plausible. I think this best
fits as a configurable response action. Just like an application may
configure AppSensor to logout the user or lock the account, they could
also configure AppSensor to redirect the user to a honeypot.  Depending
upon the honeypot and network setup this could completely invisible to
the attacker.

Now, how can we best integrate this idea into AppSensor?  AppSensor is
broken down into two main components - AppSensor the idea and AppSensor
code that is ready to use.  The AppSensor idea is our knowledge base.
This is where we include all the great ideas we have and encourage
people to leverage this knowledge in their custom deployments. This
includes all of the various detection points and different response
actions.  The AppSensor code is our efforts to create quality code
(thanks John!) that can be easily used to quickly add an AppSensor
capability into an application.

The first step for any new AppSensor concept is to define it within the
"AppSensor Idea" portion of the project.  I would recommend reviewing
the current response actions wiki page (great work Colin!) that is
listed here: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_ResponseActions 
Figure out where your idea should go and then add it to the wiki.  You
can also bounce your write-up/ideas off of Colin and Ryan to get their
feedback too.

Would you be willing to take the lead on that idea and get it added into
the wiki?  Let me know if you need wiki login credentials. I can help
with that.


Thanks!

A follow-up... I was thinking about this while in my gym's sauna after
work.... and realised:

1.  an application now or in the future might be able to proxy in this way

2.  a WAF could be considered as an application

3.  some applications are little more than proxies anyway

...so on further reflection I think it should be added as a separate
response action.  I think I was getting hung up on the example of a
WAF which could be considered as an external device.

Regards

Colin
