<PRE>Sounds great about the integration w/ ESAPI - that will definitely get
AppSensor in the hands of users who can give some great feedback for
improvement.

JohnS - thanks for jumping in and offering to patch in your ideas - great
suggestions!  I'll hold off on making any more changes related to core for a
bit.  If I do anything this week, it will be towards documentation likely.
If you have any questions I can help w/, I'd be more than happy to.

Michael, One quick question.  I did add a couple of things to the wiki -
under your detection points doc - a few of them have the Java section filled
in.  For now, there's just sample code, but there should probably also be a
snippet of the ESAPI.properties intrusion detection config for that
detection point for clarity - at least an attempt at it.  Any thoughts
towards that?  We'll certainly document it, but some may take the defaults
only to find out they've disabled a component of the app b/c there were 20
of some type of exception in 3 seconds for example.  There's really no
reasonable default for these configs - it will be totally dependent on the
site.  (traffic numbers/risk level is going to vary greatly for different
apps obviously)  If it helps, ESAPI's properties file comes w/ config for 2
or 3 exceptions (of their 10 or so) and then has one for total.

</I>&gt;<i> going to branch the AppSensor project with his ideas and then we can review
</I>&gt;<i> them and discuss before integrating into the main trunk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Keep the ideas moving! I'm going to get some more documentation together on
</I>&gt;<i> the code, revamp our wiki page so its usable and keep pushing this thing
</I>&gt;<i> forward.  Things are really moving well and we've got a lot of great minds
