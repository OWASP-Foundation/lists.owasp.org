<PRE>Lots of awesome work taking place with AppSensor. Forwarding this on to the
list so others can keep in the loop.

&gt;<i>From John Melton...
</I>
All,

I'm glad to say that after a bit of fussing, I made some progress with
AppSensor.  I got unit tests written for all of the core classes.  Not quite
sure of the test coverage just yet, but I think most of the important things
are hit.  As we find bugs, we'll add more tests (kinda the way it goes).
Also, I separated out the core code over to it's own project, and set it up
to use Maven (most of the painful work was here).  Finally, I setup the
project in a maven repository.  That way, when we put out releases, it's
trivial (dead easy if using maven) to grab the code and go.  I also removed
the code from the AppSensorDemo2 project and changed it to use the newly
built jar file from the core code - so the demo is quite small now.

The actual maven repo is here -
<A HREF="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/owasp/appsensor/AppSensor/0.1.0/">http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/owasp/appsensor/AppSensor/0.1.0/</A>  (I'm
using sonatype and it pushes to the main repo).

The googlecode url for just the core code is here:
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/#svn/trunk/AppSensor">http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/#svn/trunk/AppSensor</A>

and for the updated demo is here:
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/#svn/trunk/AppSensorDemo2">http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/#svn/trunk/AppSensorDemo2</A>

Let me know what questions/concerns you have.  I'm taking the Easter weekend
off, and have some personal stuff to catch up on after that, but I'll get
back to it soon enough.  Unless there are objections, my next planned task
will be adding detection points and documenting them on the wiki.  At some
point we'll need a code review.  As far as I'm concerned, though, we are at
a point where people can at least try plugging it in as an alpha product and
letting us know what breaks.  (by the way, my personal project is planned to
use AppSensor as well, so I hope to find bugs myself, and also try to
document things like &quot;how to get started w/ appsensor&quot;)

AppSensor is now at 0.1.0 - woohoo!  Seems like a lot of work for such a
small number though :&gt;.

Thanks,
John
