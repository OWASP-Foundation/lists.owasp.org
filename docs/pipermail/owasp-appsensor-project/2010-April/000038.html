<PRE>John &amp; John (...great same name )

JohnM as you've seen the AppSensor stuff is really starting to pick up.  
I spoke with Jim &amp; Dave last week about the integration with ESAPI. 
They'd like to make that happen soon.  I think the discussions in the 
ESAPI dev list are great and going to help facilitate that integration.

Last night I spoke at the NoVA OWASP chapter meeting about AppSensor 
(slides going online soon).  There was lots of great discussion during 
the meeting and also a good dev/debug/discussion session between JohnS 
and I for several hours that night. JohnS had some great ideas and will 
be working on a few enhancements this week - I think he's already 
communicated some of these ideas to the ESAPI list and maybe to you in 
other emails.  JohnS is going to branch the AppSensor project with his 
ideas and then we can review them and discuss before integrating into 
the main trunk.

Keep the ideas moving! I'm going to get some more documentation together 
on the code, revamp our wiki page so its usable and keep pushing this 
thing forward.  Things are really moving well and we've got a lot of 
great minds pitching in. As you guys continue with the awesome dev 
please copy me and the appsensor mailing list on those emails.


Thanks!

Michael
