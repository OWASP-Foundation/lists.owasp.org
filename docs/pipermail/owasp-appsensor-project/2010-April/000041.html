<PRE>All,

Just a heads up on progress.  I've recently added a couple more response
actions to the default response action handler.  You can now email and sms
(via email) an administrator as one of the possible response actions in
appsensor.  These have a couple of junit tests to cover them which I've
commented out since they'll fail if you don't enter your mail server info in
the config file.  As part of this, updates were made to appsensor.properties
to cover the mail properties, and there is now also a setting in the
appsensor.properties file where you can point to another encrypted
properties file (encrypted by running DefaultEncryptedProperties.main) that
holds mail server username / password auth info so it's not in the clear in
the properties file.  Finally, the pom.xml was updated to add mail.jar and
activation.jar (for handling email) to the path.

I've not been spending a lot of time adding things as of late.  I'm waiting
a bit for John S. (who graciously offered to help us out with some of the
ESAPI integration work) to get some of his changes in before changing much
more around.

Hopefully all of this is clear.  Let me know if not.

Thanks,
John
