Further to the recent discussions about new detection points, I have
updated the page at:

   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_DetectionPoints

but not any other pages on the wiki that reference it, in case there
are any further changes or recategorisation.  The changes can be seen
at:

   http://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=AppSensor_DetectionPoints&diff=85723&oldid=85169

but include 14 new detection points:

   RequestException
      RE5: Additional/Duplicated Data in Request
      RE6: Data Missing from Request

   AuthenticationException
      AE12: Utilization of Common User Names

   InputException
      IE3: Violations Of Implemented Black Lists
      IE4: Violation of Input Data Integrity
      IE5: Violation of Stored Business Data Integrity *
      IE6: Violation of Security Log Integrity *

   Honey Trap
      HT1: Alteration to Honey Trap Data
      HT2: Honey Trap Resource Requested
      HT3: Honey Trap Data Used

   Reputation
      RP1: Suspicious or Disallowed User IP Address
      RP2: Suspicious External User Behavior
      RP3: Suspicious Client-Side Behavior
      RP4: Change to Environment Threat Level

and text changes to 3 detection points:

   SessionException
      SE5: Source IP Address Changes During Session
      SE6: Change Of User Agent Mid Session

   AccessControlException
      ACE3: Force Browsing Attempts

* IE5 and IE6 are integrity excepctions and might better be in a
separate category "IntegrityException" rather than "InputException"?

The detection points we ruled out during discussion have not been
added.  I have tried to include all the examples and caveats suggested
by people.  I have added the new category "Reputation" with some
preamble before the detection points about false positives.  Further
comment and improvements to the text welcome!

Regards

Colin

PS The item "IE5: Violation of Stored Business Data Integrity" is a
new suggestion, not previously discussed.
