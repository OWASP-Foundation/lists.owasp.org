Message-ID: <CACMCCUgRtYnbrHG9Hwp_mTPmq6HUPYRWMTvnmh8D=zDHt4gtnA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, this is Sky.

I was introduced this from Michael Coates.

I'm the student in UWT doing Appsensor-related research, Michael knows
about this.

He said that subscribing and using this service is faster way to get
answers from my questions.

Is this the place for asking about the Appsensor project?

I have several question about the AppsensorDemo2. If you response my
question, I will really appreciate it :)


1. When we parsed and played with the AppsensorDemo2 to get better
knowledge about Appsensor, we met below exception (this exception happened
when we wrote <script> in the Updateprofile):

"org.owasp.esapi.errors.ConfigurationException:
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:
org.owasp.appsensor.stub.AppSensorDummyESAPIAuthenticator Authenticator
class (org.owasp.appsensor.stub.AppSensorDummyESAPIAuthenticator) must be
in class path."

But the Appsensor 0.1.3.5 API does not have this
"org.owasp.appsensor.stub.AppSensorDummyESAPIAuthenticator."
Interestingly AppsensorDemo2 doesn't show this exception, but the project
we created using your AppsensorDemo2 for practice created this problem.
I will attach our code, could you let me know what is the problem? Don't
laugh at my code plz, I'm a noob.



2. Could you explain what class calls the properties files
"appsensor.properties", "ESAPI.properties" and the others to set up the
configuration?

Thanks.:)

Best,
Sky

Sky,
Welcome and thanks for the questions. This is where you should ask
questions about appsensor. Comments inline.

Thanks,
John

This class is part of the AppSensorDemo2 codebase. If you just use the
entire project as a starting point and modify it from there, you should be
good to go. Otherwise, since you have an existing project already, you
could just copy in the
"org.owasp.appsensor.demoapp.AppSensorDummyESAPIAuthenticator" class from
the demo app and you should be fine.

The class that reads this is the
"org.owasp.appsensor.AppSensorSecurityConfiguration" class.

I am doing some work on this in the next week or so, and will post up
a draft table of contents. I will make sure we have a slot for
"glossary".
