Ahhh, ok thanks. Unfortunately I won't be there - family event that weekend
(memorial day US). I'm happy to help do any setup I can remotely - I
certainly have lots of ideas for tasks to do. Also, I'm planning to go to
appsec US this year. Maybe we can do another one there as well.

Thanks,
John

I maybe mistakenly assumed Timo was referring to the usual thing being held at AppSec conferences. The EU one is being held in Amsterdam in May.

https://2015.appsec.eu

There was an email recently about submitting requests to suggest a project/activity to participate in that recently. 

BTW Martin Knobloch is keen there is some AppSensor implementation build event there anyway.

I will be at AppSec EU, but haven't yet thought about what we could
usefully use time during the summit for. Will anyone else on the list
be there?

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Guide - Call for corrections,
	changes and additions
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBmrbreYgvLXA9RnGE29PnYUx8_-ak+b3PyB+AiuXJVg-g@mail.gmail.com>

I plan to update the current v2.0.1 AppSensor Guide during March,
particularly with reference to the new AppSensor 2.0.0 code and
AppSensor microsite.

Does anyone have any corrections, changes or additions? I have a list
myself and will aggregate further contributions to produce a summary
in early March, and produce an update Word document with track changes
enabled before the end of March.

Chapters 5 onwards also need proper review (grammar, structure and
technical), if anyone has time to help with those.

The current version can be found at:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appensor-guide-v2.doc

Please feel free to send small amendments and suggestions to this
email thread, or directly for larger contributions.

	multiple detection points same label
Message-ID: <CAM8z=yKn4GeZuSptzvvuKSpxcDv1GUi+h2=E8GnHwVaFs2nrjg@mail.gmail.com>

All,

A minor snapshot was just released to address an issue where the same
detection point label could not be reused (
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/issues/18 ) (Thanks Juan for bringing
this up).

After this update, you should be able to use the same detection point label
(eg. "IE3") multiple times with different configurations and that should be
respected. This gives you the capability in particular to trigger different
responses at different intervals, which adds a lot of flexibility.

If this is a feature that interests or is important to you, please test it
out. I'll give it a week or two for feedback, then will push it as a point
release if there are no objections.

Thanks,
John

There was a discussion over on the Leaders mailing list clarifying the
purpose of the summit.

Project Summit Countdown
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2015-February/thread.html


The invitation to participate was:

http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2015-January/013715.html


The summit is not for awareness or demo. Johanna states:

*"A summit is not a showcase but an opportunity to have all leaders
together to discuss and generate output, guidelines, give direction , take
decision regarding the direction of projects in general. **to discuss and
generate output, guidelines, give direction , take decision **regarding the
direction of projects in general."*


I have initially suggested a two-hour session to incorporate reviews of the
guide into a new version. I wrote:

*"2 hours. The AppSensor Guide v2 was published in May last year, and has
had two minor updates, the last one mainly due to the important release of
the v2 code implementation. This session is to edit and improve the guide,
since many of the chapters have not been fully reviewed. Participants
should read a chapter or two in advance of the summit (chapter 5 onwards,
but choose randomly/what is of interest) and bring their edits/comments to
the session, where the guide will be updated. All participants will be
acknowledged in the guide and on the project wiki page. The latest version
of the guide is at:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appensor-guide-v2.doc
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appensor-guide-v2.doc>"*


I am sure there are other things people might want to create, and the
project needs, but this is what I feel I can do on the day. If anyone else
on this list wants to suggest a summit session creating code, guidance,
other documentation, flyer, etc or other outputs, dive in and suggest a
session using the form linked from the invitation message above (and let us
know here!). You need to run with it though ;-)

I have also suggested output-generating sessions for some of the other
projects I am involved in.

Fabio,

Somehow I missed the content of this email. I think there's a lot of value
in translating the book. It's phenomenal work and should be more widely
available. Colin's the lead on the book, so I'll let him jump in as well.

What would this process look like?  You mentioned volunteers, but it looks
like a product with associated cost. We've earmarked some of the project
money towards book translation, so that's still a viable option.

Thanks,
John

Johanna,

A while back we discussed the project status for appsensor. We recently
released version 2 final of the code, so I thought now would be a good time
to talk again. (The v2 book was released in July, and the v2 code in
January. )

Specifically, I'd like to know how to get our project to flagship status
(or whatever we call top-level projects now). I'd like to develop a
go-forward plan with actionable steps to get there, and a timeline so we
all know what we're working towards.

Thanks,
John

Hi Colin

I already set the project to Flagship status ;-)

I'm busy setting up the projects and I hope I can finalize this week with
sending everyone a review and if the projects have move to another status

regards

I see on the project inventory that AppSensor is listed as a
documentation project:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project#tab=Project_Inventory

Could we also be listed under "Code", or give us a whole new section
called "Hybrid" and see if any other project can catch up :-)

The Guide is 51,000 words. In the next month or so I will be doing a
minor update but it shouldn't get much longer.

It's in Word - can that be edited directly in Crowdin or is there a
whole load of copying and pasting afterwords?

Just a thought, but would it be more useful to make Spanish, Chinese
and Arabic versions of the the microsite apppsensor.org first? That's
a much smaller effort and will help developers more directly.

Colin

Hi Colin , John

Indeed, for now I have set the link to both categories
Since App sensor is the only in its category we could leave it like that
now for ;-)

That is probably the best way, thanks.

I have swapped the classification on the project home page to match:

All,

I got to chat with Mark Miller about AppSensor. Direct link here:
http://www.trustedsoftwarealliance.com/2015/02/13/john-melton-and-the-owasp-appsensor-project/

Thanks,
John

I was able to catch up with John and talk to him about the project. Our
talk has been published as part of the OWASP 24/7 podcast series. If you
aren't subscribed to the iTunes channel, you can listen to our conversation
here: http://www.trustedsoftwarealliance.com/tag/owasp/ .Also on that link
are the other interviews in the series.

As a sidenote, Moxie Marlinspike on Open Source Security for Mobile
Devices, has over 2100 downloads. Pretty impressive.

Thanks to John and the team at AppSensor Project for the latest release.

Mark

Your interview made me think we should create micro-documents:

- Application Attack Detection for CISOs
- Attack detection for agile developers

(the word case is significant)

I would be very interested by such documents... it would probably make my
life easier trying to sell AppSensor internally here

Agreed 100%. I've been pointing them at the overview in the book, but
that's 10-15 pages. The dev overview is along the lines of what I am trying
to convey on appsensor.org on the main page. I think a small 1/2 pager for
each would be really helpful. I also think a marketing slick would be nice
to have for conferences.

I've talked to probably 10 people in the last month that are currently in
the process of "internal sales" of appsensor, as Louis mentioned. This
would help out there.

I imagine the CISO doc could be culled from the overview nearly directly.
And much of the info for the developer guide is there as well, maybe with a
couple snippets of pseudo-code. I'm happy to take the developer doc.

Louis, any interest in reviewing? Anyone else.

Thanks,
John

Hi John,

 

I just read your intro for developers. I find it very accurate. I like the AOP suggestion. Even though I understand this is not a ?selling brochure? I would like to suggest to add a few ?buzz? words in it. For instance, one big advantage I see with AppSensor is that I could have one AppSensor instance that tracks users across many cloud applications or many web front ends for one application, that ?cloud compatibility? should be noted somewhere ; maybe adding a bullet point or modifying one. It is important that the developers understand they do not need one instance per front end for example. Incidentally, in the ?How Do I Use It? section there are no mention that you need to setup an instance of a Tomcat server, maybe that deserve a few words. Another buzz word could be ?honeypot? ; AppSensor is a very good tool to manage honeypot pages across applications. This was one of the selling point that allowed me to start the PoC project.

 

I understand that this is one sheet thing so it might be hard or not desirable to integrate my suggestions.

 

Louis

Agreed 100%. I've been pointing them at the overview in the book, but that's 10-15 pages. The dev overview is along the lines of what I am trying to convey on appsensor.org <http://appsensor.org>  on the main page. I think a small 1/2 pager for each would be really helpful. I also think a marketing slick would be nice to have for conferences. 

I've talked to probably 10 people in the last month that are currently in the process of "internal sales" of appsensor, as Louis mentioned. This would help out there. 

I imagine the CISO doc could be culled from the overview nearly directly. And much of the info for the developer guide is there as well, maybe with a couple snippets of pseudo-code. I'm happy to take the developer doc. 

Louis, any interest in reviewing? Anyone else.

Thanks,
John

Your interview made me think we should create micro-documents:

- Application Attack Detection for CISOs
- Attack detection for agile developers

(the word case is significant)

Hi John,

 

I just read your intro for developers. I find it very accurate. I like the AOP suggestion. Even though I understand this is not a ?selling brochure? I would like to suggest to add a few ?buzz? words in it. For instance, one big advantage I see with AppSensor is that I could have one AppSensor instance that tracks users across many cloud applications or many web front ends for one application, that ?cloud compatibility? should be noted somewhere ; maybe adding a bullet point or modifying one. It is important that the developers understand they do not need one instance per front end for example. Incidentally, in the ?How Do I Use It? section there are no mention that you need to setup an instance of a Tomcat server, maybe that deserve a few words. Another buzz word could be ?honeypot? ; AppSensor is a very good tool to manage honeypot pages across applications. This was one of the selling point that allowed me to start the PoC project.

 

I understand that this is one sheet thing so it might be hard or not desirable to integrate my suggestions.

 

Louis

Ok, I put together something tonight. Y'all have a look and let me know what you think.

Agreed 100%. I've been pointing them at the overview in the book, but that's 10-15 pages. The dev overview is along the lines of what I am trying to convey on appsensor.org <http://appsensor.org>  on the main page. I think a small 1/2 pager for each would be really helpful. I also think a marketing slick would be nice to have for conferences. 

I've talked to probably 10 people in the last month that are currently in the process of "internal sales" of appsensor, as Louis mentioned. This would help out there. 

I imagine the CISO doc could be culled from the overview nearly directly. And much of the info for the developer guide is there as well, maybe with a couple snippets of pseudo-code. I'm happy to take the developer doc. 

Louis, any interest in reviewing? Anyone else.

Thanks,
John

Your interview made me think we should create micro-documents:

- Application Attack Detection for CISOs
- Attack detection for agile developers

(the word case is significant)

Louis,

Thanks very much for the review. All very good suggestions, and things I
should add. 2 quick questions:

- Is the 1-page idea important to you at all, or would 2 be ok? For
conferences we could print front and back and that would be fine. Might be
our best option to get the right info added without sacrificing the 1 piece
of paper concept
- Anything in the doc you thought was extra/not needed?

Thanks
John

-I?m not sure about the number of pages, if this is to be a handout then it needs to fit on a piece of paper so 2 pages might be ok if printed both side. However, in general, the shorter the better, if this can fit on only 1 page it is good too.

-I would not say that it is ?not needed? but it could be less essential : the first paragraph of the ?Why Should I Use It? section ? It describes what other solutions are doing and is not talking about AppSensor directly. It is an interesting context presentation and help the reader contrast what AppSensor is doing differently but I think it is the less important part of the page.

Hi John,

 

I just read your intro for developers. I find it very accurate. I like the AOP suggestion. Even though I understand this is not a ?selling brochure? I would like to suggest to add a few ?buzz? words in it. For instance, one big advantage I see with AppSensor is that I could have one AppSensor instance that tracks users across many cloud applications or many web front ends for one application, that ?cloud compatibility? should be noted somewhere ; maybe adding a bullet point or modifying one. It is important that the developers understand they do not need one instance per front end for example. Incidentally, in the ?How Do I Use It? section there are no mention that you need to setup an instance of a Tomcat server, maybe that deserve a few words. Another buzz word could be ?honeypot? ; AppSensor is a very good tool to manage honeypot pages across applications. This was one of the selling point that allowed me to start the PoC project.

 

I understand that this is one sheet thing so it might be hard or not desirable to integrate my suggestions.

 

Louis

Agreed 100%. I've been pointing them at the overview in the book, but that's 10-15 pages. The dev overview is along the lines of what I am trying to convey on appsensor.org <http://appsensor.org>  on the main page. I think a small 1/2 pager for each would be really helpful. I also think a marketing slick would be nice to have for conferences. 

I've talked to probably 10 people in the last month that are currently in the process of "internal sales" of appsensor, as Louis mentioned. This would help out there. 

I imagine the CISO doc could be culled from the overview nearly directly. And much of the info for the developer guide is there as well, maybe with a couple snippets of pseudo-code. I'm happy to take the developer doc. 

Louis, any interest in reviewing? Anyone else.

Thanks,
John

Your interview made me think we should create micro-documents:

- Application Attack Detection for CISOs
- Attack detection for agile developers

(the word case is significant)

Louis and John

For printed handouts, we may as well go go 2-sided. That will give
some more space for the logo, some more buzz words and a bit more
attention-grabbing design.

I'll take the original content and the suggestions here to work up
something now in Illustrator. If there are any more thoughts, keep
throwing them in.

Colin

I had some time on a train journey today. A new version (exported from
Illustrator) uploaded to the same place:

    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Appsensor_intro_for_developers.pdf

2-sided. The dark side is meant to be eye catching, with all the
details on the reverse. I used colours and icons from www.apsensor.org
primarily but also the book cover image faintly in the dark background
as texture. I added the OWASP logo and some key words as suggested by
Louis. I moved the app sensor bullet points up into the first part
after reading Louis's feedback. I think the "why should I.." is still
relevant. I assume we are just trying to catch people's interest and
get them to read the website, so maybe things like "Tomcat" can be
mentioned more there?

Maybe the back/detailed size looks a little cramped. Do you think I
could use a smaller text size (the main text is 12pt, the about OWASP
text is 11pt).

I will need it check alignment and so on, once we agree on the copy
etc. I will also be able to export a press-ready high-resolution file.

Colin,

Thanks so much. Looks amazing!

Feedback:
- I would remove the rest/soap/thrift/native from the front page. It's
technical detail and can be found on the website - it'll make more sense
there.
- I printed out page 2, and it could definitely have a smaller font and not
suffer. 11pt should be fine - I actually think it will look better with the
extra whitespace. I would leave the section header font as is. Feel free to
reword/shorten/remove content of mine to get some extra space.
- Under the "what is appsensor" section, we should bring up Louis' point
about a single instance of appsensor supporting multiple client
applications at once.
- If we have space (lowest priority), maybe we can also add a point that we
can correlate analysis for multiple applications for applications using
SSO.
- We should do a once over for spelling/grammar (I noticed a few mistakes I
made)

Thanks,
John

John

- rest/soap/thrift/native removed
- page 2 font size reduced and rearranged - hopefully now a bit more
visually interesting
- added some text about "single instance of appsensor supporting
multiple client applications" to "What is AppSensor?" to balance the
amount of text with "Why Should I Use It?"
- included the "correlate analysis for multiple applications for
applications using SSO" into the above too. Does that make sense?
- made a few small text changes but didn't notice any spelling
mistakes or grammar flaws - can you suggest any?
- sorted out some alignment problems

Uploaded to usual place:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Appsensor_intro_for_developers.pdf

Colin,

Looks great - I really like the new layout and formatting. Printed the doc
again - very readable and the spacing looks great.
- The comment about correlation / SSO makes sense to me.
- I think any spelling issues either got corrected or removed. The only
thing I saw this time was in the pseudo code block "iff" should be "if"

Apart from that minor "iff" -> "if" change, I like it. Consider it
reviewed/approved from my perspective.

Thanks,
John

Hey I see there is a session to work on the appsensor dashboard at the

Timo

We suggested this session because we knew there is interest, such as by you!

At the moment it is only a proposal since the summit has not yet been
given the go-ahead by OWASP, and so it is not yet possible to "sign
up". I have requested the afternoon of Wednesday 20th. Even if the
summit does not happen, we can do a "fringe event" to work on this
anyway.

Colin

Your input, and that of anyone else who can make it, will be really useful.

John

- IIF -> IF has been done
- Some further text realignment
- Added license details in footer text
- Added Copyright info and document identifier
- New screen-res PDF uploaded - called v2.0 so in parallel with code
and document

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Appsensor_intro_for_developers.pdf

I also have a PRESS-ready version for anyone who wants to get it
printed. I will zip up the files and upload shortly.

I will look into creating an A4 size version of this (for "rest of world").

Colin

All,

Wanted to send out a quick note to get everyone's opinions on what would be
good candidate projects for GSOC 2015. Please note: these have to be
code-related (can't be pure documentation) I've listed a few ideas below -
please add any you can think of:

- dashboard UI
- trend monitoring analysis engine
- "enterprise integrations" - a collection of integration points related to
either reporting (snmp, jmx, syslog, cef, etc.) and/or transport mechanisms
(message queues, avro, protobuf, etc.)

Also, if you would like to volunteer to be a mentor, please also let me
know.

Thanks,
John

I think "enterprise integration" will be very good initiative. In my view
this will increase AppSensor foot print in enterprises which is crucial to
make this project more successful.

I tried to bring in AppSensor integration with few interesting things we
are working on, but lack of integration points stalled my efforts.

My 2 cents!

Ok, extremely valuable feedback. I actually wouldn't have thought that to
be the highest priority, but it makes sense. Do y'all have a specific list
of integration points that would be helpful in your environments? We can
get those ticketed / queued up, and added as specific data points for the
GSOC project descriptions.

Thanks for considering our input John!

In my case, we are looking for JMX (OR) SNMP. Leaning more towards JMX
first.

Thank you,

Hi Giri,
I should clarify here. Are you looking for JMX notifications or the ability
to manage appsensor via JMX. Obviously different levels of effort, but want
to make sure I'm understanding the use case. What is the goal?
Thanks,
John

Hi John,

JMX notifications is what I am looking for (domain we are working is
related to monitoring).

As I think more, I think managing through JMX might not be that much
critical requirement because major cases out put of Appsensor is important
rather than configuring/managing AppSensor through JMX (Unless I
mis-understood your question).

Feel free to correct me.

Thank you,
Giri

Ok, great. I think there's a straightforward notification mechanism in JMX
we could use that shouldn't be too much trouble.

As for your larger question, I want to support what people need. If that's
JMX, that's fine. My guess is that the largest need throughout the industry
would be to have the data in some structured format that's parseable into
their tool of choice. As Louis mentioned, some people will want to use the
UI we build, but many enterprises are going to use whatever tool they have
in house that already manages this data. If we can send data out in CEF
format, for instance, and your tool consumes CEF, then we're good. What I
don't know right now is what tools most people use and what their preferred
formats are. I imagine over the long run we want to build a number of these
output integrations, but I want to prioritize them as needed.

Thanks,
John

Got it John!

I may be wrong, but here is one thought I have to eliminate this confusion
about tools and their required formats. While integration, most of the
teams/applications may not be able to directly consume the messages. They
(consuming application team) any way need to write adapters, so my guess is
CEF should be fine, because it is well known format for event notifications.

Thank you,
Giri

John and Giri
I have some notes from the past about CEF and Appsensor, but they are in the v2 guide too. pp55-56, 123-124, 131, and especially 165-167.

I also blogged last week about a couple of related ENISA reports:

Agreed Giri. Colin, thanks for the reminder and pointer.

My general opinion from experience is that people will write adapters if
they have to (and in this case I don't think it's too difficult), but
they're more likely to use your tool if it supports their environment
already. I'd love to have support for the different popular formats out of
the box. I'll try to put all this in the GSOC request in a cleaner form
hopefully this weekend. I'll also include feedback from Louis/others if
more comes in.

Thanks,
John

Message-ID: <CAAxdBBm68TsdM8ow3y8EeN9eG2xB=Uw9gskT6NBA3FP5uw7FtQ@mail.gmail.com>

The SANS Institute report says the top impediment to attack detection
and response is lack of visibility into applications, underlying
systems and vulnerabilities (and that excludes lack of visibility into
cloud applications which is a separate category).

http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/analyst/analytics-intelligence-survey-2014-35507

But then goes on to list all the networky defency/detectiony things,
but no mention of application intrusion detection. AppSensor-like
technology doesn't even appear in "[categories of] future investments
related to analytics/intelligence in order to obtain better visibility
and response" unless it is in "other".

I opened up a discussion with the operational monitoring team here. They are
using AppDynamic and SCOM. I understand that SCOM support (to some extent)
JMX but direct support would be better for them.

The SANS Institute report says the top impediment to attack detection and
response is lack of visibility into applications, underlying systems and
vulnerabilities (and that excludes lack of visibility into cloud
applications which is a separate category).

http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/analyst/analytics-intelligence-
survey-2014-35507

But then goes on to list all the networky defency/detectiony things, but no
mention of application intrusion detection. AppSensor-like technology
doesn't even appear in "[categories of] future investments related to
analytics/intelligence in order to obtain better visibility and response"
unless it is in "other".

Louis, I think you're comment was directed to this list ... "I opened up a
discussion with the operational monitoring team here. They are using
AppDynamic and SCOM. I understand that SCOM support (to some extent) JMX
but direct support would be better for them."

I took a brief look. I imagine that appdynamics will be easier to build an
integration for based on documentation. However, I don't have access to
either of these systems personally. I'll try to add this to the list.
Hopefully it's possible to have someone on your side test it out once I get
something going.

Thanks,
John

Colin,
Thanks for the link - useful paper. Yeah, I thought it was telling that it
was the #1 problem, but didn't appear to be anywhere in the list of [things
to spend $ on].

The "problem" is a good reference for the Guide and CISO briefing.

All,

Please see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSoC2015_Ideas . I added the
appsensor projects we discussed with the enterprise integrations first. Let
me know if you see any mistakes, would like any changes, etc. Also let me
know if you have other ideas, I think we can add them over the next few
days.

Thanks
John

Johanna

I see a Flagship banner has been added above our project wiki page.

When I laid out this style of project page, I was keen to get rid of
all the clutter that used to be above the tabs (e.g. book link,
advert, donation beg)

- to remove distracting content
- to move more of the project content "above the fold"

Subsequently what I did was copied onto most of the projects by others.

We are certainly pleased to be a flagship project, and than the task
force for its work, but I feel these banners are a somewhat retrograde
step, and in my opinion degrades the page design. We already have the
status in the categorisations, and while it help visitors identify
which projects are flagship, that should be done in other places on
the site (e.g. the project main page, and maybe a little on the home
page). This design element could be used within the existing banner
leaders put on the first tab of their project.

The banner should also link... somewhere.

I would like to remove the banner from the top of the AppSensor page,
or move it into a sub-tab.

I personally like it. The web was made for longer vertical documents
not to mention mobile is super kind to scrolling down. It's actually
the primary trend in website development (ie: one page sites).

If it really bothers you - I suggest you drop the AppSensor banner and
add AppSensor text to the flagship banner.

but I feel these banners are a somewhat retrograde step, and in my opinion
degrades the page design. We already have the
status in the categorisations, and while it help visitors identify which
projects are flagship

Unfortunately, the categorization in the bottom does not seem effective
enough to actually show the status of the project. The change done has been
a request expressed by many leaders. The design was made by Hugo, Owasp
Graphic designer.

I agree the banner should link to the description of the project type, so I
think I will execute this change in the weekend

Johanna

Yes I agree the button at the bottom right doesn't highlight the
status too well.

You can use the "link=" attitbute for the image to hyperlink to another page.

The current fixed width seems to be mucking up some mobile browser
views, but if you make the banner MUCH wider (say 2000 px like
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Appsensor-header.jpg ) say, you
can use this DIV technique to make it fill 100% of width
automatically:

   <div style="width:100%;height:127px;border:0,margin:0;overflow:
hidden;">[[File:Flagship_banner.jpg|link=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Project_Stages#tab=Flagship_Projects]]</div>

My concern wasn't Hugo's design, but rather the placement on the page.
If I might make a suggestion, what about making the Flagship banner
less than 120px tall.... so say 2000px x 60 px, so the information is
still there and readable, but takes up slightly less header space? See
attached (scaled) mockup.

Hello everyone,

If there are any changes that I should make, regarding sizes or design,
please do send them over.
I'm more than happy to make them.

I want everybody ti be satisfied with the design, regardless of the number
of changes to be done.

Cheers!

Hugo

Hi Hugo

I think the change suggested by Colin is nicer that the shorter header
Would it be possible to adapt this?

I am sure 80 is fine. 60 was just a suggestion.

Hello everyone,

Is it possible to be, maybe 2000x80px?
If not, I'll se what can be done, preserving teh design, with 60px height.

Hello everyone,

If there are any changes that I should make, regarding sizes or design, please do send them over.
I'm more than happy to make them.

I want everybody ti be satisfied with the design, regardless of the number of changes to be done.

Cheers!

Yes I agree the button at the bottom right doesn't highlight the

status too well.



You can use the "link=" attitbute for the image to hyperlink to another page.



The current fixed width seems to be mucking up some mobile browser

views, but if you make the banner MUCH wider (say 2000 px like

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Appsensor-header.jpg ) say, you

can use this DIV technique to make it fill 100% of width

automatically:



? ?<div style="width:100%;height:127px;border:0,margin:0;overflow:

hidden;">[[File:Flagship_banner.jpg|link=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Project_Stages#tab=Flagship_Projects]]</div>



My concern wasn't Hugo's design, but rather the placement on the page.

If I might make a suggestion, what about making the Flagship banner

less than 120px tall.... so say 2000px x 60 px, so the information is

still there and readable, but takes up slightly less header space? See

attached (scaled) mockup.

Hello Colin,

Here they are.
Tried my best to keep some of the original "feel" of the design.
See if these work.

Cheers!

All,

We just released 2.0.1. More info is here:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/releases/tag/v2.0.1

This was an update primarily to add support for the issue - multiple
detection point configurations per detection point label (
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/issues/18)

As always, happy to hear any feedback.

Thanks,
John

Message-ID: <CAM8z=y+Y1RURXNbKYMLW3Uy5Gp1ZPoq5XokQPwqaLvreyxiSKQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I just pushed some changes to a new 2.1 branch. This is where development
will continue for the next couple of months, so if you're interested in the
latest, feel free to check it out. In addition to the 2.0.1 stable release
that just happened, there's also a 2.1.0 snapshot release available as
well. Both of these should be on maven central in the next couple of hours.

The new branch has a couple of main changes initially:

- geolocation - the concept of geolocation has been added with an initial
implementation for the maxmind geoip2 database, though you can plug in
whatever provider you'd like. This allows us to enrich the data set we're
collecting (if desired).

- rabbitmq execution mode - this adds an initial capability for message
queue based delivery. This decoupled model is important in many
organizations. There are various implementations I hope to support, and
rabbitmq is the first one in place.

The code for the new branch is here if you're interested:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/tree/dev-v2.1

Final note: In addition to the changes above and others to come in 2.1 (see
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/issues), we have submitted some
projects to the GSOC proposal for OWASP (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSoC2015_Ideas). Hopefully we can get one
or more projects done this summer. Some of that work may go against the 2.1
branch depending on the timeline, so stay tuned.

As always, please send in any feedback, and if you have questions or
interest on any of these items, let me know.

Thanks,
John

Message-ID: <CAM8z=yLdAa5JBGsfNh3k_00Faef0FOfGOvdtWGDSE==USbGuTA@mail.gmail.com>

Started a new thread as the old one was getting overloaded.

Colin / All,

I liked your idea about the flyers for appsensor and thought the one for
developers turned out great. You also mentioned one for CISOs, so wanted to
see what you'd like to do there. I can put something together as a starter
like I did for the last one, though I'm much less confident in pulling the
right material. I would probably just try to grab sections of the executive
summary/overview from the appsensor guide. Would that be helpful? Just
wanted to keep momentum going.

Is anyone on list interested in helping either creating this doc and/or
reviewing it?

Note: Part of my interest here is my own selfishness. I'm going to a
conference in about a month, and would like to have some of each of these
to hand out - it's the right audience.

Thanks,
John

John / All

I did begin a little on this yesterday, so it is timely to get some more
encouragement (pressure!) to get on with it.

When John created the text for the developer flyer, and we got feedback on
it, that made it really easy for me to do the subsequent design part. At
the moment I feel stuck on some fundamental things that everyone on this
list could help decide:

   1. The developer flyer is a two-sided A4 or US letter leaflet, which is
   great for handing out in large quantities
   2. I wondered if the CISO document should be something a bit
   thicker/plusher since it is a different audience
      - What size? (see Lulu options...
      http://connect.lulu.com/t5/Product-Pricing-Information/Binding-options-and-their-page-counts/ta-p/33673
we
      used Crown Quarto for the Guide, but that isn't an option for
<32 pages) -
      US Letter or Square?
      - How many pages - just two or a little booklet say 10 12 or 16 sides
      - How bound (coil, saddle stitch or hardcover) see
      http://www.lulu.com/create/books/ for dependencies on sizes, binding,
      colours and number pages
      - Maybe colour inside?

Once we have a feel for the size of the thing, it will be easier to
determine what text can go in it.

What is the key messaging we want to push? Some buzzy phrase ideas:

   - Real time
   - Telemetry and instrumentation
   - Intelligence driven security
   - Instrument applications
   - Active defense
   - Integrates with existing monitoring systems and network defences
   - ???
   - ???
   - Already used at scale

We could then put some draft text up in a Google doc for editing?

I?d like to help by reviewing it

Started a new thread as the old one was getting overloaded. 

Colin / All, 

I liked your idea about the flyers for appsensor and thought the one for developers turned out great. You also mentioned one for CISOs, so wanted to see what you'd like to do there. I can put something together as a starter like I did for the last one, though I'm much less confident in pulling the right material. I would probably just try to grab sections of the executive summary/overview from the appsensor guide. Would that be helpful? Just wanted to keep momentum going.

Is anyone on list interested in helping either creating this doc and/or reviewing it? 

 

Note: Part of my interest here is my own selfishness. I'm going to a conference in about a month, and would like to have some of each of these to hand out - it's the right audience.

Thanks,

John

Sounds good - I answered my thoughts inline where applicable (and where I
had an opinion).

Thanks,

printing/binding is nice, I'd still plan for people who want to print it

sounds about right once you strip down the content, add a nice front page,
and then account for section/page breaks for printing.

List members

I was just checking up on this request to change the use of our remaining
funds... it was on the agenda for the 11th February 2015 board meeting and
it is mentioned from about 13.30 ins into this recording:


https://www.dropbox.com/s/w2v76kwhgnxcclk/2015-02-11%2016.10%20OWASP%20Board%20Meeting.wmv?dl=0

That was cut off at 15:00 minutes, but the board seemed to suggest we
didn't need their approval - just the project manger. But of course that
position is vacant.  I think we would have asked the project manager first,
but my real motivation for asking was due to the CHANGE OF USE. Anyway the
minutes state:

   "Board acknowledges notification around AppSensor project spending and
supports it."

https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/13TnxGl4N1fM0IcVi104d-2CqKfBrDJVeCV2HdxFgtsI/edit

So I think we are fine,

Colin

As long as you are moving the charity along in some way, use those funds as
you see fit. They are your funds, AppSensor team. If you need
clarification, talk to Paul our ED. But really, Board approval is not even
remotely necessary or even appropriate. :)
