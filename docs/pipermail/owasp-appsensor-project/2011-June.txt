Thought these were interesting - thought I'd pass along in case anyone
missed them. They highlight the integration process with Apache Shiro - good
read.

An update on these presentations...

The presentation at the ISSD Conference in London on 19th May was
received well, but again interest in "who is doing this" as if in
disbelief.  However many people clearly got the idea and were
impressed.  I hadn't watched Michael's presentation to OWASP
Minneapolis St Paul at that time, otherwise would have mentioned the
"large insurance company" too.

In Athens at the OWASP Greece training day, there was an audience of
140 - most of whom were developers.  Lots of questions on the
practically of adding these ideas, and one about using it for anomaly
detection.

At AppSec EU today, I had a question about which frameworks offered
support (ESAPI and Shiro), the potential effect of adding more
vulnerabilities by adding more code (certainly possible), whether
syslog could be used for signalling (yes).  My live demonstration of
example AppSensor dashboards was slightly hindered by some display
resolution problems with the projector, but I have uploaded the videos
of the demos to YouTube:

The AppSec EU presentation will appear on the OWASP wiki in due course.

Colin,
VERY COOL. Those videos are great. It really shows the power of what
appsensor can do with proper visualization. Just curious - what was the demo
UI built in?
Thanks,
John

All,

I had to forward this on to the whole list (original email to appsensor project list). Colin has done an incredible demo illustrating the power of an AppSensor dashboard detecting and responding to application attacks.  I'm really impressed (yes, I'm biased to this project but that doesn't change how awesome I think the demo is)

I was talking about this sort of architecture:

1. Attacker
2. -> Attacks
3. -> -> Application
4. <-> <-> AppSensor
5. -> -> -> -> Signalling
6. -> -> -> -> -> Dashboard

but wanted to show a whole range of example data (detection points and
responses).  It was therefore easier for me just to demo 5 & 6.  To do
that, I did:

5.a  Log file of events (like a security event log)
5.b  Perl with Sockets to read the log file and broadcast the events
onto the network
6.a  A Comet (Ajax push) server to collect the events and stream them
to subscribing clients
6.b  A static web page built using HTML, CSS and using the Dojo
JavaScript toolkit for the general layout
6.c  The web page contained three tables which subscribed to the
particular feeds coming from the Comet server

For simplicity the web page was also hosted on the Comet server, but
in practice it would be a separate 'proper' web server.  I had some
prior experience with Lightstreamer, so used that for the Comet part
and adapted their demonstration scripts and their Lightstreamer
JavaScript libraries to display characteristics I wanted to show.
That server has a free licence for a single subscribing IP address.
There are other Comet servers available including open source ones
which I would like to investigate.  Then I would really like to get
something more robust built that say integrates with ESAPI in some
way.  Then we can join all the dots from 1 to 6 in a single
application.

I should also say, if anyone would like my original .MOV files of the
screen recordings, I can email them directly.  They are better quality
than the way YouTube has re-processed them.  About 12 and 32 Mb files.
