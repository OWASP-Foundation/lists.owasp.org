<PRE>Re the 'mini honeypots': that would be me then :)

Been lurking on this list for a while, but not had a chance to contribute anything.

Looking at the list of detection points I'd like to propose another one.
As I mentioned in the Newcastle talk I put hidden fields in some forms which look like potential vulnerabilities.
For example you could have &quot;admin&quot; set to &quot;false&quot;.
Of course these sort of fields are really 'hacker traps' - they can never be changed by any normal user actions.
If they are changed then its a very good indication that someone is trying to attack your app.

I realise that you could class these in the existing ACE* set, but personally I think its work having a specific new point, if only to promote the idea of putting such 'traps' in for hackers.

And thanks for the talks Conlin, both very interesting.

Cheers,

Simon

No don't know him.

The AppSensor talk at OWASP Leeds/North in Newcastle, UK went down
very well this evening.  Lots of interest.  One guy already using mini
honeypots in their apps (checking for modification to otherwise
useless hidden fields).
