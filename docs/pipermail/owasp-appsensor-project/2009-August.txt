Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Cross-contribution between the OWASP
	AppSensor Project, the XDAS4J 	project and the OWASP Logging Project
Message-ID: <5052fa140908160311t78858163q79020612f636286a@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,



Of course, I think that cross-contributions between the XDAS4J and the
OWASP Logging projects are a very good idea.


I have a suggestion to make regarding:
- the Action Taxonomy as defined by XDAS4J and
- the event classification provided by the AppSensor project.


The current XDAS4J proposal involves a Class level for event
classification, which is a group of similar events (example: User
Management, Data Management, ...)

The OWASP AppSensor projects provides such a classification at
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSensor_Project.


Joel, please have a look at this project and tell us what you think.


I'll start to provide some more detailed feedback next week.



Regards,
Marc
