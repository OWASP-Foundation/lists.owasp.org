I'm assuming you sourced in the appropriate dependencies for appsensor in
the maven pom.xml?

That's a tough one to debug if there's not more information. I really have
no idea where this failed. Is there more info you might provide?
Unfortunately debugging with this config is going to be a challenge. If you
can't get more data, maybe you can put your code on github and I can try to
check it out and debug it.

For the "local" implementation, you are primarily using the
appsensor-server-config.xml file. The appsensor-client-config.xml file is
not really used here, though it shouldn't hurt anything.
