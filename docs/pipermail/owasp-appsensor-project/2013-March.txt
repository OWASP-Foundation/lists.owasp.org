Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] how to detect if a detection point is
	created and sone other questions
Message-ID: <513A7279.3090005@gmail.com>

Hello,

I was wondering if there is a way to detect in my code if a detection 
point is created.

For example i have the code

if ( checkIntrution() )
{
     new AppSensorException("AE8", "Providing Only the Username ", 
"Provided Only the Username");
}

and I want in my code to check if the AE8 has been created is there any 
solution using only the Appsensor API?

alternatively I have thought I way with a boolean variable

for example

boolean isCreated=false;
if ( checkIntrution() )
{
     new AppSensorException("AE8", "Providing Only the Username ", 
"Provided Only the Username");
     isCreated=true;
}

....

if( isCreated )
{
....
}


Also I was wondering if there is a solution on detecting in which action 
is a Detection Point

for example lets say that in esapi.properties I have this:

IntrusionDetector.AE8.actions=log,logout,disable

is there a way to see in which action is a detection point in my source 
code ? for example I want to check if the action is in logout.


Also if a user in not authenticated as I have seen, Appsensor treats him 
like anonymous and the only action that can be applied in an anonymous 
is log.

is there a solution if I want to disable access to an anonymous?

Thanks in advance

Panos

Panos,
Great questions.

There is no mechanism for checking if a detection point has been triggered.
Depending on your needs, you could do it via the boolean setting you
mentioned or possibly by wrapping the intrusion detector with your own
custom class and attaching observers for notification if you wanted that
feature. Note however that this only informs you that a detection point has
been triggered. You'd have to determine the detection point by examining
the "code", ie AE8. Also note this is not a GUID, ie. multiple of these
could be fired.

As for checking which was the last response action executed, you could do
something like the following:

APPSENSOR.intrusionStore().getIntrusionRecordForUser(yourUserHere).getLastResponseAction("AE8");

As for working with anonymous users, there's currently only support for
logging really. You could augment the system to do certain things based on
IP or other identifiers, but it would require you to extend our system.
This is one of the challenges I'm trying to tackle in version 2 of the
code, which I'm currently working on.

Thanks,
John

Actually I want to blog malicious users, who are trying for example 
bruteforcing the login.

I thought something and I would like to ask you to advice me.

If in the login page when a user visits it, is it possible to create an 
Appsensor user without the users who visits the login page do nothing 
and knows about it?

For example if I visit a page a random username is picked up and an 
Appsensor user lets say bob is created.

So the user that visits the login page is not anonymous but bob. So I 
think that Appsensor can disable the access ?

My questions mow:  Do you think that a scenario like this can work and 
help me disabling access to anonymous?

This concept doesn't really make sense to me, but I suppose it could work.
The important piece is having some way of ensuring the same "user" is
assigned to Bob every time. If it's all in one session, that's probably not
an issue, but on repeated visits, you'd need some method of correlation,
like the IP address I mentioned earlier or some other mechanism. The other
issue with using a random username is that you don't really know what that
represents. You should try to use something identifiable.

Thanks,
John

Yes random username isn't so good idea actually is very bad idea.I 
thought  of getting the IP and giving  it as username for example 
"Ano192.168.1.1".  I think that something like this it will work. I'll 
try it.

Thanks,
Panos

One of the issues is the concept of identity, it only takes [32 bits of 
information to identify 
somebody](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/primer-information-theory-and-privacy). 
IP Address is certainly not enough and unsurprisingly you can easily 
gather enough information to have very high confidence in identity 
without any username or password.

And you will most certainly you will have enough information to make a 
Baysian decision (how likely is it this identity is being hostile?) 
based on the behaviour of that identity (33 bits) for AppSensor. I 
suggest that anybody who doesn't surrender the '33 bits' is perhaps 
automatically suspect since they fall outside your standard deviation 
model of users.

A better link on [browser 
uniqueness](https://panopticlick.eff.org/browser-uniqueness.pdf) that 
will give you much better information about uniquely identifying 
visitors without either username or password. Of course my browser only 
gives 21.4 bits of the 33 required; however even that is information 
that gives you a high degree of confidence about me. Also remember IP 
addresses have origins; and origins have populations - information is 
being leaked all over the place?

IP address information is not at all sufficient for user identification. Of
course, an user may user different systems for accessing an application.
Instead a two level security check can incorporated to give the access
which can avoid unauthenticated entry into the application.

Thank you very much for your suggestions. Firstly I'll try to study 
about these and secondly to implement them.


Thanks

Of course!

We are not doing authentication nor access control. What we are doing 
does not require positive identification. All that is required is just 
enough information for creating AppSensor 'detection points'

For example - if you have the 33 bits of information about all 
authenticated users; and you hashed that information and compared it to 
a hash of of the 33 bits of information about anybody who is attempting 
to log into the site - you now have enough information to know 
statistically if you have a new user, or a returning user with a high 
degree of certainty.

Of course nothing is perfect; I myself travel the world and google 
always fails to get my language settings correct despite my having 
literally set them in my profile.

Nevertheless, I have no doubt that my 21.4 bits of entropy give you far 
more information about me as a person than any IP address ever would - 
despite my changing localities all the time. And that information is 
more than enough to make decisions about me with the OWASP AppSensor.

E.g. If my 21.4 bits of entropy attempt to hack you with say a SQLi - 
you can likely ban my 21.4 bits of entropy at the application for 4 
hours with a great deal more success and less side effects than my IP 
address (current 'best practice') and the entire point of the OWASP 
AppSensor concept.

Does this make sense to you Santosh?

Browser Fingerprint Changes During Sessions of my book -

This uses JS code to send to the browser, it then calculates a hash of the
browser fingerprint and then adds it as a cookie value.  This is then saved
server side in the SessionID collection.  This way you can track the
unauthenticated user by their browser fingerprint.

Yes Dennis..I understood...Instead of relying on IP address data, Its
better to tackle with browser finger printing mechanism. Even though it may
not provide 100% reliability on malicious user info, but it significantly
improves your requirement criteria.

Well, we are through to the final. I cannot make that day but will ask
around if anyone nearby can attend.

Colin

===================

Congratulations, you?re through to the final of ESET?s CyberSmart
Awards! We would love you to join us for our awards ceremony which is
taking place in the Birmingham Science Museum on April 12 at 12pm. We
would like to offer you two invitations for the short ceremony, which
also give you all-day access to the museum, lunch and a goody bag.

We had a fantastic range of submissions showing how people up and down
the country are working hard to educate others about online security.
As the calibre of entries was so high, and a glitch in the voting
system meant that not everyone was able to cast the votes they wanted
to, we have decided to let our esteemed panel of judges look at all
the entries and decide on our deserved winner and runners-up.  The
event should be a great opportunity to network and share ideas among
other organisations striving to help the UK become cyber-smart.

Please RSVP by close of play on Wednesday April 3 to let us know who
will be joining us on April 12 in Birmingham. There?s an RSVP form
below. We look forward to seeing you there!

Best wishes,

The CyberSmart Team
