<PRE>Hi,

 

I know I&#8217;m a bit late to comment on this but I also think it should be printable and staple-able (is that a word? :) ). About the buzz words list here are a few others that might be useful (or not) :

 

Malicious behavior detection

Proactive security

Application context intelligence

First line security

Scalable

 

I know it is somewhat obvious to us but : &#8220;community driven&#8221;, &#8220;open source&#8221;, and &#8220;free&#8221; might also be important to mention to a CISO that might not know that much.

Sounds good - I answered my thoughts inline where applicable (and where I had an opinion).

Thanks,

John / All

 

I did begin a little on this yesterday, so it is timely to get some more encouragement (pressure!) to get on with it.

 

When John created the text for the developer flyer, and we got feedback on it, that made it really easy for me to do the subsequent design part. At the moment I feel stuck on some fundamental things that everyone on this list could help decide:

1.	The developer flyer is a two-sided A4 or US letter leaflet, which is great for handing out in large quantities
2.	I wondered if the CISO document should be something a bit thicker/plusher since it is a different audience

*	What size? (see Lulu options... <A HREF="http://connect.lulu.com/t5/Product-Pricing-Information/Binding-options-and-their-page-counts/ta-p/33673">http://connect.lulu.com/t5/Product-Pricing-Information/Binding-options-and-their-page-counts/ta-p/33673</A> we used Crown Quarto for the Guide, but that isn't an option for &lt;32 pages) - US Letter or Square?

I'd prefer &quot;printer paper&quot; - something standard sized, which I'm guessing is A4 / US Letter. 

*	How many pages - just two or a little booklet say 10 12 or 16 sides

The overview in the guide is about 30 pages. There's some stuff that can be removed, but a significant amount of value remains. While a professional printing/binding is nice, I'd still plan for people who want to print it out and staple it. That can be done double-sided, so I'd say 12-15 pages sounds about right once you strip down the content, add a nice front page, and then account for section/page breaks for printing.

*	How bound (coil, saddle stitch or hardcover) see <A HREF="http://www.lulu.com/create/books/">http://www.lulu.com/create/books/</A> for dependencies on sizes, binding, colours and number pages
*	Maybe colour inside?

Yeah, I imagine more people will print this one in color, so that'd be nice
 

Once we have a feel for the size of the thing, it will be easier to determine what text can go in it.

 

What is the key messaging we want to push? Some buzzy phrase ideas:

*	Real time
*	Telemetry and instrumentation 

You can add &quot;cloud friendly&quot; in this bucket since cloud makes obvious the need for visibility into applications

*	Intelligence driven security
*	Instrument applications
*	Active defense

Augment to say it's &quot;automatic&quot; (the system handles the response) and that you can respond however you want (not a canned set of responses) - if you can implement it in code, you can do it.

*	Integrates with existing monitoring systems and network defences
*	???
*	???
*	Already used at scale

I'd also add &quot;forward thinking&quot; using some of the references that have said this is the next direction to go

 

 

We could then put some draft text up in a Google doc for editing?

Yep - that makes the most sense - accessible and supports comments

Started a new thread as the old one was getting overloaded. 

Colin / All, 

I liked your idea about the flyers for appsensor and thought the one for developers turned out great. You also mentioned one for CISOs, so wanted to see what you'd like to do there. I can put something together as a starter like I did for the last one, though I'm much less confident in pulling the right material. I would probably just try to grab sections of the executive summary/overview from the appsensor guide. Would that be helpful? Just wanted to keep momentum going.

Is anyone on list interested in helping either creating this doc and/or reviewing it? 

 

Note: Part of my interest here is my own selfishness. I'm going to a conference in about a month, and would like to have some of each of these to hand out - it's the right audience.

Thanks,

John
