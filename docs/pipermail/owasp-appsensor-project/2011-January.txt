Message-ID: <AANLkTi=UOqvnbw0ZTbK_Uc=NHBBCvc+8SQDvZJeo13bj@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I came across the "Global Security Challenge" website:

   http://globalsecuritychallenge.com
   http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/gsc_about.php

They have a current worldwide competition "IFSEC Future of Security
Competition 2011 for "seeking technological innovations that can be
used to prevent, defend against, recover from or cope with any kind of
terrorist incidents or other criminal acts".

   http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/blog_detail.php?id=365
   http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/gsc_competitions.php#ifsec

They say "This newly launched annual competition aims to find the next
generation security innovations.  We aim to challenge the brightest
minds in security technology from around the world to submit radically
new ideas and game-changing technologies. The competition aims to
uncover the creative capabilities of innovators in universities and
small to medium sized enterprises that apply to security needs." and
"This competition brings together the world?s most promising
technological innovations at IFSEC 2011 who will compete against each
other in a live judging session. This is a unique opportunity for the
chosen entrepreneurs to find capital, industry partners and government
customers."

I just wondered whether we ought to submit AppSensor, with the aim to
raise $10,000 towards, for example, developing ESAPI code and
demonstrators e.g. ESAPI Swingset?  It would raise awareness, even if
we didn't win.

I'd be happy to draft some answers (see application questions below),
if others on here are willing to participate?  Deadline 31 Jan 2011,
finalists announced after 28 Feb, with final judging (incl live pitch)
mid-May in Birmingham (UK?).

This sounds very exciting. I think we should submit an entry.  The only thing I'd like to have verified is any transfer of ownership.  Clearly we don't want any implied ownership or rights to AppSensor as a result of submitting an idea (or winning).

Otherwise, looks great.  I'd like to be involved in the process and review the submission.


Thanks for identifying this Colin!

AppSensor Team

Okay, I've begun a page for drafting the response at:

   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_GSS_IFSEC_2011

Some of the questions will require effort to produce engaging and
convincing responses.  On the "how will we spend $10,000", I was
thinking about suggesting spending in three areas:

- coding
- documentation
- marketing

Does that sound okay?  Maybe with a 50/25/25% split?

I'll do some more draft copywriting over the next week, but feel free
to plunge in.

At some time (not now, and before the 31 Jan), we'll have to run it
past the Board, since we are submitting a funding application in the
name of the OWASP Foundation.  And it will all be out of the way
before the summit.

I beg that you spend the bucks on coding and documentation. We don't
need marketing, we have enough folks over-selling OWASP tools and
libraries as it is.

AppSensor Team

I have added some more preliminary text to:

   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_GSS_IFSEC_2011

It needs the facts checked, and further expansion, particularly Qs 14
- 18.  If anyone has time, please can you help.

I've also suggested some uses for the potential prize money - it may
be too many things to fund.  What do you think?

I'll begin drafting an email for the Global Projects Committee, who we
should probably contact rather than the Board to ensure we have them
on board.

Regards

Colin

Colin,
Lots of excellent work here.  My only comment would be I think question 14
(and maybe 15) needs to have a couple sentences added (or maybe the graphic
if possible) from Michael's past presentations about the bank concept, where
you have the visualization of a bank that is protected by all the controls
vs. the bank that is not.  To me, that's a powerful picture that displays
the appsensor concept pretty well.
Nice work!
Thanks,
John

Hello John

Is that page 12/13 of:

   http://www.owasp.org/images/0/06/Defend_Yourself-Integrating_Real_Time_Defenses_into_Online_Applications-Michael_Coates.pdf

I'll add a description, but linking to some of Michael's presentations
sounds like a good idea.  I believe the application form is text only.

Colin, Yep, that's exactly what I was thinking of.  Too bad it's text only,
but yes, that's what was in my mind.

John:

> Colin, Yep, that's exactly what I was thinking of.

Okay, I'll write that up.


Everyone:

Regarding "approval" for our application, I've put together a draft
email for the Global Projects Committee:

------------------------------------
Brad, Jason and Tom

Contributors to the AppSensor Project are hoping to apply for some
project funding to the "Global Security Challenge":

  http://globalsecuritychallenge.com
  http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/gsc_about.php

The GSC has a current worldwide competition "IFSEC Future of Security
Competition 2011 for "seeking technological innovations that can be
used to prevent, defend against, recover from or cope with any kind of
terrorist incidents or other criminal acts".

  http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/blog_detail.php?id=365
  http://globalsecuritychallenge.com/gsc_competitions.php#ifsec

It doesn't cost anything to enter.  We have begun a draft of text for
the application at:

  http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_GSS_IFSEC_2011

but would like to run the idea past the Global Projects Committee.
Unfortunately, we only came across this idea just over a week ago, and
the deadline for this particular competition is the 31st January 2011.
 The ideas of what we'd plan to use the possible $10,000 award are
shown on the draft wiki page (still under discussion on the AppSensor
mailing list), but essentially is more coding (for ESAPI integration)
and documentation, rather like the outputs from the Summer of Code
2008.

Our view is that all the award would be used to "pay" for work on the
project, i.e. no contribution to OWASP overheads, and that it would be
run in the same way as other funded OWASP projects, with reviews and
the like.  It's just that these would be supported by an award - there
seem to have been other "sponsored" projects in the past I think?

As to who would do the work... we think that should be open to
competitive bids to produce the required release quality deliverables,
or fixed prices for certain deliverables and compare alternative bids
based on reputation and what else they offer?  Clearly there are
potential people already involved in the project who may want to bid,
but it should be open to apply in the usual way.

Have you had to deal with anything like this previously?

We'd welcome your input, questions, etc.
------------------------------------


Is this okay?  How about the bit about how the money would be used and
how people would be selected to do the work?

Colin

Dear all

The draft text has been altered, corrected, extended and updated with
suggestions from Alex, Jim, John and Michael.  I haven't had any
comments back from the Projects Committee, other than a "wow" from
Tom, so will be assuming its a "yes to proceed".  For those of you who
have offered to review it, and anyone else, please could you do so
now.

   Draft 2
   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_GSS_IFSEC_2011#Draft_2

In particular, please check:

- Do we have the dates and other facts correct?
- Are the references to vendors, in Q15 (about understanding the
market) acceptable/accurate?
- Do we have the right set of deliverables for $10,000?
- Are the comments about Java, PHP and ASP.NET acceptable?
- Have we mis-represented anything/anyone?

We have to submit our entry by Monday.

Thank you,

Colin

Message-ID: <AANLkTikhA3V8tonxYVDb-DkAxLejHffQyNhDAWdQbv1x@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I was wondering if we might change:

   STE3: High Number of Same Transaction Across The Site

to

   STE3: Significant Change in Usage of Same Transaction Across The Site

to include reduced usage as well as greater usage?  And remove the
word "number" so it might include frequency, and quantitative aspects
like "amount" or "value".  Otherwise we could create STE4.

An example I'm thinking of is, a website has been compromised so that
part-way through a business process, users are being redirected to
some other website to complete the transaction.  A sudden drop in
number of users would be a good indicator of a problem.

Great, thanks Colin.

FYI - I will be adding some basic learning rulesets to ModSecurity soon
that will be able to enforce this type of detection point and I will make
sure to add reference pointers to these.

Oh good, that sounds interesting.  I'll update the ModSecurity
cross-references on the Detection Point page once the next rule set
comes out.

In the summit session about Enterprise Web Defense Roundtable...

   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011_Working_Sessions/Session068

... I've scribbled a note to myself about how an application could
inform other systems (e.g. SIEM, WAF, audit software) what its
allowable entry points were - some sort of application surface
definition language.  Ivan Ristic did work on this a while ago where
self-learning WAFs might be able to export their impression (profile)
of the entry points.  It would be nice if there was a common way of
expressing this.  Of course the application (should?) knows this and
doesn't have to guess.

Then for example, if AppSensor could tell a WAF what its surface was,
the WAF could say signal back to AppSensor details of missing static
content requests (ACE3: Force Browsing Attempt) which the application
might not otherwise know about, because the web server normally deals
with the error.  The application profile might have enough information
to assist with some of the other RequestException detection points
too.

You said 'Not Applicable' for phone #, yet on
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP#Contacting_OWASP

there are both phone and fax numbers listed:

 301-275-9403 (phone)
 301-604-8033 (fax)

So I'm not sure that was intentional and you didn't want to list a
phone # or just couldn't find one.

Regarding Q6, since OWASP predates AppSensor by a good # of yrs, perhaps
you should say (from
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP#The_OWASP_Foundation)
something like:

	The OWASP Foundation came online on December 1st 2001 it was
	established as a not-for-profit charitable organization in the
	United States on April 21, 2004. The AppSensor project was
	conceived in 2008.

For Q9, since they state "select your answer(s)", you can pick more
than one. I think you might list it like this:

	Primary: Integrated Security IP Network Solutions
	Secondary: Intruder Alarms

as I think that IDS is mostly about alarming of suspected intrusion. (Of
course, if they have a description somewhere of 'Intruder Alarms' being
something completely difference--I see no detailed description of the
choices--disregard this comment.)

In Q11, I suggest adding a bullet something like this:

	+ AppSensor results in less false positives because it is
	  instrumented where it has context of the application.

Note you could refer to the answer to Q13 here if you wished.

False positives are a big reason why many don't use an IDS or have
turned their's off, so I definitely think that's something that should
be highlighted in Q11.

For Q12, you mention the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
license, but if I'm not mistaken, the source code itself is also
delivered under a BSD license. At least I see statements like this

	AppSensor is published by OWASP under the BSD license.
	You should read and accept the LICENSE before you use,
	modify, and/or redistribute this software.

at the beginning of most of the source code.  So I think the BSD
license should also be mentioned in Q12.

In Q15, the 4th paragraph states:
	Recent reports by analysts have indicated there is a
	positive return on investment for build security into
	software development processes in a formal manner:

I believe that "for build security into ..." *should read*
"for building security into ...".

That's all that I found.  Really looks great Colin. Thanks for
taking the initiative to do this.

Thanks for these - I agree with them all, and have updated the
document (Draft 2 still, but the changes are in history).  In fact,
some of the points are very important.  I was hesitant to include the
phone and fax number since no-one on this list would be answering it,
and actually that answer is optional on the entry form.

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] AppSensor Tutorial Site Online - Beta
Message-ID: <CC7F001B-E1CD-4F15-BDCC-10A54801CFB3@owasp.org>

All,

The AppSensor Tutorial code is now running at defendtheapp.com. (Friendly note: AppSensor protects the AppSensor-Tutorial on 8443; however, OSSEC protects the webserver on 80/443. So if you scan 80/443 you'll be auto added to hosts.deny for a bit)

Here's the direct link to AppSensor-Tutorial
https://defendtheapp.com:8443/AppSensor-Tutorial/lesson.jsp

This is a beta release. Please provide any feedback, bugs etc.

Also, I have a really amateur landing page at http://defendtheapp.com.  Any web design gurus that could make that a little nicer?


Thanks

Michael Coates

Thank you for everyone's help with this.  The entry form was submitted
a few minutes ago, and I received an acknowledgement by email (see
below).  I've printed the web form response to a PDF:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Appsensor-gsc-ifsec2011.pdf

We should hear something within a month.
