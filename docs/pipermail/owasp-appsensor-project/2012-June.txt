Michael or Colin,
Looks like the first step here is to agree on the table of contents. Could
one of you point to that doc? Maybe we can have a quick comment/review
period to make sure we get appropriate feedback and get that milestone
crossed off the list?

Thanks,
John

Thought this was a clever story of how etsy uses appsensor like detection
to find attackers probing for vulns.

Agreed and and even better full preso from Etsy's Zane Lackey is here
"Security at Scale: Effective approaches to web application security" -
http://www.slideshare.net/zanelackey

Essentially hows how to leverage AppSensor-like Detection Points and use
graphing and visualization to identify fraud, etc..

Great preso.
