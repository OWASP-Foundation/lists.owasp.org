Colin,
I've had this sitting in my inbox and just got a chance to look at it. This
is fantastic work! Something like this is really needed by the community I
think. Awareness about logging is currently severely lacking and ad-hoc, so
this is excellent.
Thanks,
John

John

Thank you. It was a bit of a brain dump.  I like to have all my notes
on a subject in one place, and I just thought, I may as well scribble
a cheat sheet. If you, or anyone else, have any more logging ideas,
feel free to add them in the wiki.

Do you think doing one for "Application attack detection and response"
would be worth writing? Just to define the important concepts (not
logging, doesn't do detection for you, secure code first, etc), rather
than delving in too deeply - and of course a link or two into
AppSensor. I don't mind writing most of it.

Colin

I think that would be a good way to get awareness. The cheat sheet series
is popular, so would be good to get more people exposure to the concept
whether or not they use our implementation. The idea is sound.

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] AppSensor Book V2 - Community Driven Book
	Writing
Message-ID: <D48F9615-93DD-4F19-BEDE-A4617F1C5625@owasp.org>

AppSensor Experts & Enthusiasts,

Last fall at the AppSensor summit we hashed out the framework for the next version of the AppSensor book.  Based on several years of feedback and the collective expertise of core contributors, and those with fresh new perspectives, we arrived at a good skeleton. But, alas, we don't have a single page written so far!

I'd like to discuss how we can collectively go about creating the next great app sensor book. The traditional approach is for a few of us to sit down and crank out the whole book over 12-14 months and have some pier review - but I just don't think that truly leverages our open source and collective skills effectively.

I'm going to propose an alternative approach - community driven book writing.

Approach
1. Collectively agree on the skeleton / table of contents (pretty close here)
2. Determine writing style guides / tone / language (region for spelling purposes)
3. Determine a small number of core authors 
4. Determine a larger number of contributing writers
5. Divide responsibilities (e.g. book sections/ chapters) to core authors
6. Core authors map out overall flow of their sections
7. Core authors and contributing writers create their sections
8. Continual review from core authors across their sections
9. Review, adjust, repeat


Core Author
- Subject matter expert on their section
- Responsible for entire chapter or section
- Drives the main ideas covered in the sections
- Responsible for pier review of all content in respective section, organization of ideas
- Works with contributing writers to arrange material, flow
- Nomination and acceptance process for all Core Authors

Contributing Writers
- Contributes a small (or larger) amount of material within any section they feel comfortable
- Expert within the areas they are contributing text 
- Stays within the defined style guidelines

Attribution:
Everyone that contributes would be recognized. We would emphasize individuals that contribute substantial amounts of work.


Think of a core author as an architect and a contributing writer as a developer (except we have an architect per major book section & there are pier review between the architect and all developers in the respective section)



Crazy idea? Suggestions? Could this work?

Michael,

Given that John Melton & I are co-mentoring a student to implement web
services as part of GSoC 2012, perhaps it would be advisable to push back
the dates (at least the end date) a bit so the results of the work could ne
included.

Also, Andrew van der Stock is leading up an effort to get a revision of the
OWASP Dev Guide going so perhaps these two efforts could be coordinated
somehow???

For this to work, we will need to hire a project manager + wiki editor
+ copywriter (some Design skills for graphs, cover and diagrams would
also help)

That way the Core Authors + Contributors can focus (with 'soft
pressure' from the project manager) on creating content.

I would prefer it if we funded it using the
GSD<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSD> project.
It makes a lot more sense - think of the momentum that would be generated
behind simple things like paying $500 per chapter written with in the
deadline on topic and hiring a designer to lay it out for $1500?

Before we get ahead of ourselves I want to gauge interest.

Per our wiki page we have the following core contributors to the project
(if someone is missing, please update) -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project

Are any of you interested in this idea and shepherding a section (as a core
contributor) where you are a subject matter expert?

Simon Bennetts
August Detlefsen
Dennis Groves
Randy Janida

Thanks,

I'm game for being a core contributor to the development / implementation
sections. I'll add to Kevin's note that my primary goal for the summer is
the mentoring for the google summer of code resource we have, so the heavy
lifting from me will probably come in a couple months.

Thanks,
John

Experts and enthusiasts

I have to admit that I think I agreed to lead the effort to write a
new book, and I am sorry I have not progressed this further to date. I
have begun writing some sections based on the structure discussed at
the summit.

Additionally Manuel Lopez offered assistance and tried to solicit
input for the case studies section, but without too much success.

I agree it would be better to allow for the inclusion of material
relating to the GSoC 2012, but that means we can focus on the other
parts before then. I am happy to continue contributing, or even
drafting outline sections for others to write, expand, improve and
review. Personally I wouldn't want money, a paid project manager, wiki
editor or copywriter - but I'm sure those suggested resources might
help on other projects. I just need time, which I am hoping to make
available soon.

Colin

Colin,

No need to fall on the sword (so to speak) - we were all enthused about the next book revision from the AppSensor Summit and we just didn't collectively get the ball rolling.

I think we can all take another pass at it in this new format together.

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Demo - Social Netwworking App
Message-ID: <CAE_gAbKZBxgu4THKXCZigeE1gerOPvTjLVhpB0xg0ykjHcBZoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Team,

The presentation about the project posted in the OWASP page (
https://www.owasp.org/images/0/06/Defend_Yourself-Integrating_Real_Time_Defenses_into_Online_Applications-Michael_Coates.pdf)
shows
a demo about how the framewrok can be implemented in a social netwroking
app.

I want to promote the project in my chapter in Guadalajara and I would like
to use that material. Where can I download that application as well as the
code?

Thanks!

Regards.

Manuel,
The core library is available here:

The demo app you're referring to is available here:

Message-ID: <CAAxdBBkSxRa4za8jgHYj4_fVZe3yXy_QcCt8S_zyvH=-guP8Ow@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

I have created a page at:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor

to request some funding for marketing expenses once we get the current
code/documentation work completed. My thought was to fund printing of
books we could give away when speaking about AppSensor at OWASP
chapter and other infosec/dev meetings (5-10 per event), and to pay
for the printing of a promotional flyer for inclusion in OWASP
conference event bags. If someone is speaking at an event they would
order 10 books from Lulu and invoice the foundation.

If you have any thoughts on this, please discuss them here and/or
update the proposal page.

Colin

Colin,
This looks good to me. I'm not helpful calling out ideas for spending the
money, as my "marketing" skills are non-existent. I'll rely on whatever the
group has seen be most effective.

However, I did really appreciate the remainder of the document,
specifically goals and budget. OWASP has had some issues w/ regards to how
money has been spent in the past, and I appreciate you being proactive in
laying out exactly what it will be spent on (as well as what it won't be
spent on).
Thanks,
John
