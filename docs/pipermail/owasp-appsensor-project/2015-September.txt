Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] 2.2.0-RC1 released
Message-ID: <CAM8z=yKK2CDJag8=fSCou2S+Y5F2Lu6okTs5rqs2hEqpvzH_XQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I just released 2.2.0-RC1. This is the first release candidate for 2.2.0.
More info is here:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/releases/tag/v2.2.0-RC1

There are a few updates in this release, but the primary change is the
introduction of a user interface (affectionately called appsensor-ui). The
specifics are here:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/blob/dev-v2.2/changelog.txt

Pending any significant issues, I plan on one more release candidate,
followed by a final release in mid-late September.

As always, happy to hear any feedback.

Thanks,
John

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] appsensor summer happenings
Message-ID: <CAM8z=yKbevbMgfY8YyhOUZrrSQpAesA4X0bD1QcThZJ_MsE+bw@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Just wanted to send out a quick note. It's been a VERY busy summer for the
appsensor project. Here are the key updates:

*1. *We just completed the OWASP summer code sprint. We had a fantastic
student (Sumanth, cc'ed) working with a great Mentor (Timo, cc'ed) and
myself on a couple of exciting projects. Over the course of just 6 weeks.
Sumanth was able to get output from appsensor integrated into 2 different
visualization stacks.

The first was ELK (elasticsearch - logstash - kibana) and the second was
influxdb / grafana. Both of these visualization toolsets are very popular
and, importantly, already integrated into many organizations. These
projects showed that the appsensor data can easily be brought into an
organization no matter the environment. This really shows off the hard work
done on integration for the overall project. It also gives folks a couple
of good options (that work out of the box) for using industry-standard "big
data" tools with appsensor data.

For anyone who's worked with these tools, you know 6 weeks is a challenging
timeline to get one of these things done, much less two. I can't say enough
about the work Sumanth and Timo did. It was a lot of effort, and the
results are excellent.

*2.* I just sent out the first release candidate for 2.2.0. The significant
thing about this release is it's the first appearance of 'appsensor-ui'.
The UI is a simple dashboard that will be maintained over time to support
the growing needs of the appsensor users. I've kept it simple for now, but
feedback will really help drive the design and use of the tool. Thanks to
all who contributed ideas and designs here - they were immensely useful.

*3. *I'll be speaking at AppSec USA about appsensor. If you will be there,
I would love to chat. Feel free to reach out. Also attend the presentation
if you can, should be a lot of fun to show off what different people have
been working on. I'll be presenting the work Sumanth / Timo did as well as
a couple of other very interesting and exciting side projects.

Thanks,
John

Congrats and good timing releasing it just before AppSec USA.
That and your talk should definitely help its exposure to a broader
audience.

Hello,

I saw another list email about this earlier this month, but didn't see a
reply.  I'm also interested to know if there is a document that shows the
API details for the Appsensor Web Services.  Thanks in advance,

Jon,

Hi, thanks. I don't have these published right now. Are you speaking about
the REST api or the SOAP api? What format would be most useful?

The API is very small, so it shouldn't take long to produce.

Thanks,
John

Jon,

Just wanted to get some clarification on which web service you're looking
for. Is it rest, soap, or something else?

Thanks,

Jon,

I don't have this easily and clearly documented, so I've created a ticket (
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/issues/27) to remedy that.

However, until that's done, I wanted to pass along the info I have:

The code handling REST requests is here if you are interested:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/blob/master/execution-modes/appsensor-ws-rest-server/src/main/java/org/owasp/appsensor/handler/RestRequestHandler.java

There are 3 basic functions. They are:

== Add Event ==
- POST to "/api/v1.0/events"
- Pass an "Event" object (see attachment)

== Add Attack ==
- POST to "/api/v1.0/attacks"
- Pass an "Event" object (see attachment)

== Get Responses ==
- GET to "/api/v1.0/responses"
- Pass an "earliest" request parameter (RFC 3339 timestamp string)
- Receive back a collection of matching responses

I've attached a file that includes both a sample JSON for each and the
associated JSON schema.

You'll need to spin up a server handling REST requests. The quickest way to
do that will be to follow the install instructions in the main appsensor
project readme, then go to this directory (
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/tree/master/sample-apps/appsensor-ws-rest-server-boot)
and run 'mvn spring-boot:run'. That will get you a server that's accessible
at http://localhost:8085/api/v1.0/*. One further point for testing (if you
use the server I pointed out). You'll have to pass along a request header
named "X-Appsensor-Client-Application-Name2" with a value of "myclientapp".
Otherwise you'll get an error.

If you have further questions, feel free to ping me either on or off list.

Thanks,
John
