Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Webgoat with appsensor problem
Message-ID: <e1f6e5065d0e6573dd4168cae24699f1.squirrel@webmail02.uoa.gr>

Hello
I am trying to add appsensor to webgoat in BlindSQLInjection but althought
it seem to logging the user then it redirect to the page webgoat.jsp and
when i am trying to go to page BlindSQLInjection i have again the same
problem. I think that there is a problem with sessions/cookies but i can't
find what. Do you know why this is happening?
I add the BlindSQLInjection file and the esapi.properties file
Thank you very much

I was wondering who else is going to AppSec EU this year?  We should
perhaps propose a presentation about AppSensor during the OWASP Track?

To: owasp-leaders <owasp-leaders at owasp.org>



OWASP?Leaders,

The Call for Papers for the?OWASP?Track?at Global?AppSec?Research/EU
(July 10th through 13th 2012 in Athens, Greece) is now open.??OWASP
leaders with interesting projects/activities can submit here:
https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGJEYlFsQi1xamx5c2kyTTdGcmZCZkE6MA#gid=0.
?The CFP for?will close on?April?15th 2012.

Submissions must:

Be about active?OWASP?Projects or activities
Be in a 50 Minute or 15 Minute format (final schedule will be
determined in conjunction with the event)
Authors must agree to the?OWASP?Speaker Agreement
Comply to the applicable?Global Conference Committee Policies?(related
to all events & speakers)
Be?OWASP?branded, no company templates (presenters must limit mention
of their employer to a company logo on the concluding slide of their
presentation)

Recommendations:

Presentations that provide a link to a recording of previous presenter
performance will be scored significantly higher
Presentations on active projects will be scored higher
Some projects will be determined as once?OWASP?wants to highlight so
new project leaders should not be discouraged if they have great
presentation skills

The?OWASP?Track?initiative, jointly led by the?Global Conferences
Committee?and the?Global Projects Committee, is a new effort to help
OWASP?promote our projects and activities at our own major
conferences. The goal of this?track?is to highlight and promote?OWASP
and offer our leaders a chance to showcase their activities. As such
this is a different CFP than one typically issued, submissions should
highlight a particular?OWASP?project or activity that is important to
the community at large. The joint GCC/GPC program committee will be
judging these submissions on a variety of factors, including
project/activity maturity, strategic value to?OWASP, relevance to the
event audience, and past presentation performance. We intend to
highlight brand new projects and activities along with established
ones, so new project leaders should not be discouraged from applying!
Keep in mind though that we are looking for polished presentations so
it will help your submission if you can demonstrate that your
project/activity has made recent strides in improving quality.
There are limited?OWASP?funds to support travel for selected
presenters, we will ask that presenters first solicit funding from
their employers for travel to the event.

Presenters that perform well in their?OWASP?Track?talk will be invited
to join the?OWASP?Speakers Group.

Regards,
Global Conferences Committee, Mark Bristow, Chair
Global Projects Committee, Jason Li, Chair

Hello all
I have this input :
station=101 OR 1=1
When i am checking if it is sql injection command with the command
boolean
verifyattack=org.owasp.appsensor.AttackDetectorUtils.verifySQLInjectionAttack(station);
it returned false.
I think it should return true. I am correct? What the problem is?
Thank you very much

That is not a valid SQL statement, so this could be part of the problem.
A valid SQL statement always ends is a semi-colon. ";"

assuming you made a typo in this email, then 'station=101 OR 1=1;'
is indeed an attempt at SQL Injection for a given input however there 
are two additional things that are going on:

a) this field must actual be part of a SQL query
b) input validation must not be done on that field

All three conditions must be true or you will get a 'false' result.

As for the incredible software written by the contributors of OWASP; I 
honestly can not say as my involvement in the project is that of an 
architect interested in the patterns and principles.

Here is the current SQL Injection attack strings from the
appsensor.properties file -

# This collection of strings is the SQL Injection attack pattern
listsql.injection.attack.patterns=\\-\\-,\\;,\\/\\*,\\*\\/,\\@\\@,\\@,nchar,varchar,nvarchar,alter,cursor,delete,drop,exec,fetch,insert,kill,sysobjects,syscolumns

As you can see, the attack payload you showed would not match any patterns
here.

We discussed SQL Injection a bit at the AppSensor Summit last September and
the difference between WAF attack detections (negative security signature
matching) and what AppSensor does.  There is a balance here between
accuracy and detection.  To me, this is a false negative as this is
obviously an attack attempt.  I see two options -

1) Expand the sql.injection.attack.patterns list to include more patterns.
2) Utilize Detection Point RP2 -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_DetectionPoints#RP2:_Suspicious_External_User_Behavior.
 If you have a ModSecurity WAF in front of an AppSensor host (proxying or
doing mod_ajp) you can have ModSecurity export its attack detection alerts
and add them into the request as new request headers.  We call this
"Request Header Tagging" -

Agreed - this is a false negative. The sqli regex is far from
complete, and is just a proof of concept at the moment, although it
does detect certain things. It'll be an area that should get some love
on the next release hopefully.

We should collaborate. I am thinking of creating an "Attack Payload Database" project where we can develop vetted payloads for various attack types (SQLi, XSS, Directory Traversal, etc...). We already have a bunch of these in the OWASP ModSecurity CRS, but that is implementation specific. I think we need to abstract out the signature/patterns themselves for use in other applications. 

For instance, Varnish uses the CRS payloads -
https://github.com/comotion/security.vcl/tree/master/vcl/breach

Also, Akamia's WAF service uses it too. 

I am thinking that we need a central repo in XML or something that describes what to look for and optionally where to look for it (param payloads, cookies, etc...). 

If we can get a good format that is easily parsable (ModSecurity's rules language is not) it could more easily be consumed by other apps. 

Thoughts?

I love it.

We've started to get some better insight into what the different scanner tools do based on our automated virtual patching work (http://www.slideshare.net/denimgroup/the-self-healing-cloud-protecting-applications-and-infrastructure-with-automated-virtual-patching-9445404) I've got a couple other things on my plate right now, but in a week or two I could probably get that lab environment re-set up and we could use the Snort and mod_security logs to start building up a database. I'd love to have that in a centralized place that could then be used to create AppSensor signatures, generate virtual patch, etc.

Thanks,

Dan

Cool. I had spoken previously with Sean Barnum at Mitre about CAPEC and perhaps this could be used by them too. 

I will start te ball rolling on getting this setup as an actual OWASP project - Attack Patern Database. Let me know who else wants to contribute.

Hello all
I am working on sql injection attack and i found that the patterns have
some problems. If you test killme it returns attack. Also the other words
in the pattern's list, when one of these is discovered in the text it
returns attack, althought the most of the times is not. I am trying to fix
the pattern for or/and now cause this attack is not recognised at all for

Could these two pattern find the most sql injection attacks that have or,and?
[ ][oO][rR][ ].*[=<>!]
[ ][aA][nN][dD][ ].*[=<>!]
I think they can have some false positive but it is rare? Is this pattern
include the most attacks? If not can you please tell me the kind of attack
that is not being included?
Thank you very much

Can you take a look at this work that Jon Gill and Roger Seagle
did regarding the extending ESAPI WAF and make sure that it is still
compatible with using AppSensor within ESAPI? I'm not sure
I could make an accurate assessment without diving significantly
into AppSensor. The changes to ESAPI WAF is limited to these 6
ESAPI source files:

    src/main/java/org/owasp/esapi/waf/ESAPIWebApplicationFirewallFilter.java
    src/main/java/org/owasp/esapi/waf/configuration/AppGuardianConfiguration.java
    src/main/java/org/owasp/esapi/waf/configuration/ConfigurationParser.java
    src/main/java/org/owasp/esapi/waf/rules/Rule.java
    src/main/java/org/owasp/esapi/waf/rules/SimpleVirtualPatchRule.java
    src/main/java/org/owasp/esapi/waf/internal/InterceptingHTTPServletRequest.javaes:

If these changes are not compatible with using AppSensor with ESAPI, would
this be something that maybe the AppSensor gang would be interested in
considering with a similar extension?

Thanks,

After a quick look - there's nothing that would break functionality w/
appsensor. Things are done slightly differently, and there's some
overlapping functionality (blocking/redirection), but it doesn't break
anything for us.

The one proposed change that makes the most sense for appsensor to
implement is the "mode" where all parms are validated against a simple
constrained whitelist. We in essence get that for free if you use it
with ESAPI (via the SafeRequest API b/c an exception is thrown if you
try to getParameter w/ data that doesn't match the regex in the ESAPI
config file), but it could be useful in the case where appsensor is
used in standalone mode. I'll add it to the list. Thanks for the heads
up.

I thought that the ESAPI WAF code was being removed and separated out to
the OWASP-JAVA-WAF project -
http://code.google.com/p/owasp-java-waf/


How do these two relate?

Hi , I am a new user of app sensor and was wondering if appsensor is going to be coming out of bet anytime soon?
Are there any folks who have used it or are using it in production applications.

Regards,
Gaurav

Guarav,
Hi, I don't think the current version of the appsensor code is coming out
of beta. We have a new version planned that should expand the capabilities
and make the software more "enterprise ready". I'm actively working on it,
but it is taking a while since it's a volunteer project :). When it's done,
my guess is that we'll push to get that version through alpha/beta/prod.

As for usage in production, very few have actually mentioned it to me.
However, we've had a good number of questions on the mailing list, and my
guess is it is occurring. Michael Coates (project lead) works over at
Mozilla, and has implemented appsensor like concepts into their environment
(I believe in python), so the idea is being used there, but not our
specific code.

Hope that helps.

Thanks,
John

I should state that I have also used AppSensor in a large enterprise; and
honestly to a great deal of success. Unfortunately they feel AppSensor is a
competitive advantage and thus don't want to be identified as a reference
customer of AppSensor at this time. :(

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Do we need a Blacklist Regex Repository?
Message-ID: <CB697456.444CA%ryan.barnett@owasp.org>

I wanted to send this to the list for feedback.  I have been thinking quite
a bit on a this particular issue, especially after the recent thread on the
SQL Injection detection RegExes -
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-appsensor-project/2012-February/00034
2.html

I think that we (OWASP) need to develop a Blacklist Regex Repository for
detecting common attack payloads (SQL injection, XSS, RFI, etc?).  Something
similar to this old Validation RegEx Repo but for attacks -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Validation_Regex_Repository

My thinking is that we should focus on the RegEx Repo and then various other
projects can import/use them (AppSensor, ModSecurity CRS, etc..).  I would
like to get good participation from the Breaker community to help vet the
RegExs.  I know they will never be 100% foolproof but looking at some of the
"example" blacklist RegExs floating around in various project code makes me
cringe?  We can do better.

Not sure if this should be a stand-alone project or not (probably) but I

+1 for me as a standalone project - it'll be beneficial to others, and
I certainly don't have the chops to make it happen :)

Yes I think standalone.

I think these types of great ideas are more likely to be maintained if
they don't just become a part of something else. For example I was
thinking of submitting some things to the OWASP Logging project,
rather than adding it to the AppSensor book v2 (yes it has begun).

I like the idea of the blacklists and do think we should create them for attack detection. But, we need to add a big warning at the top of the page "This is for attack detection and is not intended to protect or prevent attacks. Use whitelisting validation and contextual output encoding to safely handle user data in your application"

The worst thing would be for the blacklists to take off and then developers use those regexes instead of good defensive design.

Agreed - these should be used to categorize/label payloads that violate implemented whitelist validation methods. These help AppSensor to label item as malicious vs suspicious.

I'm a big fan of this sort of thing.
I'd much rather we had a set of well defined, well maintained libraries / repositories / other building blocks that people can easily reuse then every tool maintaining their own lists.
The (small) amount of reuse in security products has always disappointed me.

Cheers,

Simon

I wanted to send this to the list for feedback.  I have been thinking quite a bit on a this particular issue, especially after the recent thread on the SQL Injection detection RegExes -
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-appsensor-project/2012-February/000342.html

I think that we (OWASP) need to develop a Blacklist Regex Repository for detecting common attack payloads (SQL injection, XSS, RFI, etc...).  Something similar to this old Validation RegEx Repo but for attacks -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Validation_Regex_Repository

My thinking is that we should focus on the RegEx Repo and then various other projects can import/use them (AppSensor, ModSecurity CRS, etc..).  I would like to get good participation from the Breaker community to help vet the RegExs.  I know they will never be 100% foolproof but looking at some of the "example" blacklist RegExs floating around in various project code makes me cringe...  We can do better.

Not sure if this should be a stand-alone project or not (probably) but I would like your feedback.

Thanks.

Hi Guys,
I am trying to log trend events to a separate log file. I have implemented the TrendLogger interface for my logging. Is there anything else I need to do to log tend events. I don't see any trend events in the log file.

I am under the impression that the log method gets called on an intrusion . How do I use this TrendEvent?

Any help would be appreciated.

Regards,
Gaurav

Guarav,
You can look at the following files to see what we do in the demo app
related to trending data - fairly simple. The base functionality is in the
core code, but adding trending events to the system and detecting them was
put into the demo app.

http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/trunk/AppSensorDemo2/src/org/owasp/appsensor/demoapp/trend/InMemoryTrendMonitor.java
http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/trunk/AppSensorDemo2/src/org/owasp/appsensor/demoapp/trend/InMemoryTrendMonitoringContextListener.java
http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/trunk/AppSensorDemo2/src/org/owasp/appsensor/demoapp/AppSensorLoggerFilter.java

Hope this helps.

Thanks,
John

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] AppSec EU
Message-ID: <CAAxdBB=wdp=q-AjWumrdoJmi=EhP+txjrgNUEsu6CRps4gnP7w@mail.gmail.com>

I gave a 40 minute presentation at Anglia Ruskin Univerity in
Cambridge UK last night - along with Dinis Cruz and Fabio Cerullo:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Pilot_Cambridge_WebAppSec_Mini_Conference_2012

People were very interested and the developers got the idea straight away.

But I wondered who else involved with AppSensor is going to AppSec EU
in Athens this year? The local chapter there has had presentations
about AppSensor, but maybe we should present at the OWASP track anyway
for the wider audience:

   https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2012-February/006796.html

Any thoughts?
