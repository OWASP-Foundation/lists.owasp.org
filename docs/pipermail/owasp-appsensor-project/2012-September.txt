There is a partially complete draft. Authors are working on sections and we hope to include information about the new code being written.

The PCISSC published new guidance for "developers" (device, OS,
application and merchants) on Friday:

   https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Mobile%20Payment%20Security%20Guidelines%20v1%200.pdf

Interesting phrases in "Guidelines for the risk and controls in the
supporting environment":

   "ability to monitor events and to distinguish normal from abnormal events"

   "ability to report events (e.g. via a log, message, or signal)
including cryptographic key
    changes, escalation of privileges, invalid login attempts
exceeding a threshold,
    updates to application software or firmware, and similar actions"

   "providing the capability for the device to produce an alarm or
warning if there is an attempt
    to root or jail-break the device

    "create the ability to remotely disable the payment application"

Message-ID: <CAOWhLLQ5XGM13oV=SMVEhH=fWJkXfck62JxESGT2XY92FitODQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm thinking about implementing the concept of AppSensor in my project and
am wondering about the thresholds for Response Actions.

For example, if a user has had a number of input violation errors that are
clearly related to attempts to circumvent the application, should the
internal tracking of this activity be limited to the user's current
session? Or persist session to session?

For example, if the system has a threshold of 3 violations before logout
and in the current session the user has had 3 violations, that would
constitute a logout. But if the user in the current session had 2
violations, logged out, then logged back in, and had another violation,
should the logout occur?

Basically, I'm asking -- is there a recommended basis for interval that
this occurs? By session or by a time period like 24 hours?

Thanks,
Stephanie

Stephanie,
This is a great question, and probably one that will need to be
decided on a per-organization and even per-application basis.

However, by default, the current implementation evaluates the data on
a per-user basis without considering sessions, ie. the results are not
cleared out on logout/login. That means that either scenario you
presented would produce an intrusion in the current model.

You could certainly write a bit of code to clear out the results for
the user on logout if that's what you decide is appropriate for your
application. I would just consider that an attacker could use that to
his/her advantage by doing, say, 2 bad things, then logout/login, then
2 more bad things, etc. and never reach your thresholds.

Thanks,
John
