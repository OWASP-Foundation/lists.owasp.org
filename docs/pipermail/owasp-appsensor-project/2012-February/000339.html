<PRE>I was wondering who else is going to AppSec EU this year?  We should
perhaps propose a presentation about AppSensor during the OWASP Track?

OWASP&#160;Leaders,

The Call for Papers for the&#160;OWASP&#160;Track&#160;at Global&#160;AppSec&#160;Research/EU
(July 10th through 13th 2012 in Athens, Greece) is now open.&#160;&#160;OWASP
leaders with interesting projects/activities can submit here:
<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGJEYlFsQi1xamx5c2kyTTdGcmZCZkE6MA#gid=0.">https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGJEYlFsQi1xamx5c2kyTTdGcmZCZkE6MA#gid=0.</A>
&#160;The CFP for&#160;will close on&#160;April&#160;15th 2012.

Submissions must:

Be about active&#160;OWASP&#160;Projects or activities
Be in a 50 Minute or 15 Minute format (final schedule will be
determined in conjunction with the event)
Authors must agree to the&#160;OWASP&#160;Speaker Agreement
Comply to the applicable&#160;Global Conference Committee Policies&#160;(related
to all events &amp; speakers)
Be&#160;OWASP&#160;branded, no company templates (presenters must limit mention
of their employer to a company logo on the concluding slide of their
presentation)

Recommendations:

Presentations that provide a link to a recording of previous presenter
performance will be scored significantly higher
Presentations on active projects will be scored higher
Some projects will be determined as once&#160;OWASP&#160;wants to highlight so
new project leaders should not be discouraged if they have great
presentation skills

The&#160;OWASP&#160;Track&#160;initiative, jointly led by the&#160;Global Conferences
Committee&#160;and the&#160;Global Projects Committee, is a new effort to help
OWASP&#160;promote our projects and activities at our own major
conferences. The goal of this&#160;track&#160;is to highlight and promote&#160;OWASP
and offer our leaders a chance to showcase their activities. As such
this is a different CFP than one typically issued, submissions should
highlight a particular&#160;OWASP&#160;project or activity that is important to
the community at large. The joint GCC/GPC program committee will be
judging these submissions on a variety of factors, including
project/activity maturity, strategic value to&#160;OWASP, relevance to the
event audience, and past presentation performance. We intend to
highlight brand new projects and activities along with established
ones, so new project leaders should not be discouraged from applying!
Keep in mind though that we are looking for polished presentations so
it will help your submission if you can demonstrate that your
project/activity has made recent strides in improving quality.
There are limited&#160;OWASP&#160;funds to support travel for selected
presenters, we will ask that presenters first solicit funding from
their employers for travel to the event.

Presenters that perform well in their&#160;OWASP&#160;Track&#160;talk will be invited
to join the&#160;OWASP&#160;Speakers Group.

Regards,
Global Conferences Committee, Mark Bristow, Chair
Global Projects Committee, Jason Li, Chair
