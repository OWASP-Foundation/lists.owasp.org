<PRE>Kate hartman has asked for contributions to the OWASP annual report, so I
think we should highlight AppSensor. I have drafted some text below. I
guess the 2014 report just covers 2104, but think we should mention
everything produced in the last 12 months to date, since many were largely
created in 2014. I drafted the text below and would welcome feedback:

---

In the last year OWASP's flagship AppSensor Project has published a series
of significant outputs to help raise awareness and adoption.
AppSensor defines a conceptual framework and methodology that offers
prescriptive guidance to implement application intrusion detection and
automated response and in addition, the project also provides a reference
implementation that allows developers to use these powerful concepts in
existing applications. Software architects and designers like the concept
when they learn of it, and it fits well with a DevOps mindset. The
difficulty has been spreading the idea. The new project outputs build upon
the contributions of over 40 volunteers from around the world named on the
project's wiki page, and have been created to share the knowledge and ideas
to a range of different audiences. The project team has produced a
microsite at www.appsensor.org, an introduction for developers in the form
of a two-sided flyer, a large-format publicity poster, a 12-page CISO
briefing, a 200+ page technical guide, and most recently a v2.0 reference
implementation. Furthermore two project leaders have been interviewed about
the project by Mark Miller for the OWASP Podcast. OWASP has provided the
platform for the team to work together and publish these vendor-neutral
outputs under open source licenses, and also provided funding through the
2012 project reboot initiative to pay for the printing and distribution of
flyers, posters and guides at meetings, conferences and other events. We
are beginning to see the AppSensor ideas, originally from 2008, beginning
to appear in security analysts' thoughts and also in new offerings in the
open source and vendor product spaces. Looking forward into 2015, v2.1 of
the reference implementation is expected by mid-sumemr and will include a
number of enhancements, including additional options for integration
enterprise security event management systems.

I thought we could send a screen grab of the large format poster (like page
1 of the developer leaflet but with the microsite URL instead of the &quot;turn
over...&quot; text) as the accompanying picture.
