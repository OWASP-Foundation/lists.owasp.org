Hello Colin,

I am writing to reach out to you regarding a new grant opportunity I
am working on. Let me start by giving you a bit of background on the
opportunity. In the last weeks we (myself and Seba) have researched to
partner with LSEC (an independent not-for-profit network organisation
uniting a variety of experts of IT security, details on www.lsec.be)
in Belgium to respond to a call for projects from the European
Commission (EC) within the ICT PSP Competitiveness and Innovation
Framework Programme (CIP) 2013, as part of the EC Europe 2020 Strategy
(details on http://ec.europa.eu/cip/ with the call for projects on
http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/page/call_CIP).

This is a project under Call 4, Trusted eServices, for the protection
of websites against attacks and stimulating the uptake of innovative
ICT based services and products, which falls right within the OWASP
body of knowledge.

The main objective is to have better protection of business and
website owners against cyber-attacks against their websites, affecting
their business and reputation and reducing the risk of spreading
malware. Additionally, we aim to increase the security of users and
consumers by reducing the security threats created by malicious
websites.

The OWASP AppSensor Project has been selected as a potential project
to participate in this initiative. We would like to know if you are
interested in participating in this initiative.

I would like to encourage you to join our call next Tuesday, May 07,
2013 at 8:30pm CET. Seba and I will be on hand to explain this
opportunity in more detail, and please feel free to reach out to us
before then if you have any questions.

Looking forward to speaking with you next week.


Thank you, Colin.

I am not the AppSensor project leader - I think it would be best to
seek views from this list and/or speak to Michael Coates about any
formal involvement.

Samantha has kindly produced a summary of the telephone conference call:

   http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2013-May/009287.html

Seba and Samantha have asked if projects want to participate in this
bid for funding.  It seems it is "match funding" and voluntary work
doesn't count. So ideas have to cost money, and be paid equally by
OWASP and the EU.  Some examples that came up during the call were:

- Pay a designer to rework the existing code review guide into a more
accessible and stylish document
- Fund travel and expenses for an individual project summit where
volunteers (in their own time) create extensions to ZAP for example

Part of the cost of these examples might also be contributions to
OWASP staff salaries.  OWASP will not pay volunteers of course, so
anything we have to do to make any of these ideas happen has to be
done in our own time.

I hope I have summarised the issues correctly.

So, do we have any ideas of things we think this type of funding could
be practically used for in the AppSensor project? I am not sure of the
funding timescales, but think it might be from next year. However we
need to come up with ideas ...today.

Colin

(from my previous email - that did not seem to get sent)

What Seba & Samantha require from us to move the project forward is:

Our Biographies:

- [Dennis Groves](http://about.me/dennis.groves).
- Your Bio Here (please send bio)

A list of things we want to accomplish with the funds:

- The OWASP AppSensor Guide Book
- The OWASP AppSensor Dashboard
- The OWASP AppSensor Reference Implementation
- Your Contributions here (please suggest)

Anything else I have forgotten?

Cheers,

Dennis

Do we need to identify specific costs that could be paid to support
these activities. My understanding is that volunteer work can only be
supported by expense payments, or payments to external commercial
companies.

A fully-funded AppSensor party might not count either :-)

I guess we could? My goal was to get some of the goals of the project documented for this bid, after all our problems don't begin until we receive the grant. 

It would allow us to do a lot of things we just don't think about because they are way to expensive to pull off. Think about the beautiful graphic design in OWASP SAMM for example; it adds a lot - and makes the project look much more professional than many of our other projects that are equally mature and viable. Cash makes a difference. ;-)

I was just getting stuff on paper in the hope that Seba and Samantha wind up with a really great problem for us to have to solve.

I have no doubt that printing books, cards, etc? will create the required receipts. As well as travel to give talks about AppSensor.

A party no - a working session? perhaps - you will note that I didn't put that in the list. ;-) However, imagine John is ready for release and we spent a week documenting and testing the hell out of it? In addition to doing final reviews on the book? As well as the working out the logistics to launch the new book with the release, and figuring out the dog and pony show tour of the world? We may very well have a ton of fun for us - but that would be a mere side effect of the concentrated effort and rapid communication that money could provide us to get work done by bringing us together.

Dennis

I agree with all of this. Do we need to define some numbers then....
just a random suggestion:

  Euros

15,000 Graphical design
20,000 Printing and distribution of books and promotional flyers
20,000 Funding travel and expenses for working meetings
20,000 Travel and expenses for europe-wide promotional events
15,000 VAT?
        0  OWASP staff
        0 OWASP volunteers
----------
90,0000

Probably too much... so what is our bid?

Colin

Hello OWASP AppSensor Project Leads and Contributors,

I am just reaching out to gauge your interest in the AppSec USA 2013 Mini
Project Summit event module this year. The local event organisers expressed
interest in inviting a handfull of project leaders to participate in this
initiative this year, and I wanted to send over more information for your
reference.

The OWASP Project mini Summit is a smaller version of the much larger OWASP
Summits. This event module gives our project leaders the opportunity to
showcase their project progress, and have attendees sit down and work on
project tasks during the event. It is an excellent opportunity to engage
the event attendees, and it gives project leaders the chance to move
forward on their project milestones while meeting new potential volunteers
that can assist with future milestones.

I wanted to reach out to projects that currently have grant funding in
their budgets first. I want to give you guys an opportunity to engage the
community to get some of those milestones completed in this forum. Please
do reach out to me if this is something that interests you.

Thank you, Team.

Sam G.

The foundation is not providing support of any kind. I don't know if 
this is a new change that came with the ED or if it has always been this 
way. I do know however, that other conferences do support their Leaders 
and Speakers, and I don't think this bodes well for OWASP from a 
competitive perspective. It is one thing to get people to volunteer, 
quite another to expect them to volunteer and foot the bills. :(

Hello Colin & Dennis,

There is some support available. I have some funds allocated for Project
Leader travel and hotel costs for AppSec USA. I suggest thinking about
using project funds first, and if you still require assistance with travel
and accommodation  then please do reach out and let me know. We can then
see if there are enough funds to cover these expenses for you.

Hello Colin,

Understood. I have checked my records, and AppSensor currently has $5,497.97
American dollars in the budget. I am scheduled to receive an updated budget
record from Alison at the end of every month, and this is my most current
one. If there hasn't been any spending within the past 15 days, then this
number is accurate.

Let me know if you need more information, Colin.

Maybe that is the $5,000 that was allocated after a bid for funds in
the Reboot initiative:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor


This was requested to fund design, print copies and flyers for the
AppSensor book. It is not intended to be used to subsidise any
particular conference.

Hello Colin,

Apologies for the delay. I was away most of last week.

I am glad that these funds are already allocated to future activities for
AppSensor. I do have another option for you. I have some funds to help
project leaders travel to participate in activities such as these.

Below is the estimate of the funds needed based on your flight costs, and
hotel cost. I am assuming you will be coming in from Heathrow.

Hotel Estimate: $400.00 USD per night

Roundtrip Cost Estimate: $1175.75 USD

If you would like to stay 3 nights, the total cost of your trip and stay
alone will be estimated at $2,375.75 USD.


That is a pretty high amount, but we could do a room share and bring down
the price. What do you think? There are options, but it depends on what you
would like to do and what you are comfortable with. Let me know.


Thank you, Colin and team.

SG

Thank you for this information, but I think there has been a misunderstanding. I don't think I deserve any special treatment. The conversation I thought was generally about the project, not about any one, or any particular idea in particular.

Maybe if there are funds available, they should be open to all projects to bid for, and OWASP to decide how best to spend its limited budget.

But a nice thought for a moment!

Colin

Sounds good, Colin. To add more explanation, I have $3,000 allocated to use
for Project Leaders requiring travel assistance to AppSec USA only. The
event organisers have expressed interest in inviting 5 projects to the
summit so I am reaching out to those projects to see if they are interested
in participating. The $3,000 can only be used for this purpose as outlined
by our 2013 budget, and we have to share it between members of all 5
projects if needed. The idea is to ask PLs to use their project funds for
travel and accommodation, and to only use the $3,000 as a last resort for
expenses since it has to be shared.

The AppSec USA team would like to invite members of AppSensor, but we
cannot afford to pay for everyone. That is why I am reaching out to you to
see if you are interested in participating. That goes for the rest of the
AppSensor team, keeping in mind that our travel budget is limited and must
be shared with other projects.

Do let me know if you are interested in participating.

SG

OWASP would get most value from helping people already in North
America travel to the conference. I am not aware of anyone speaking
about AppSensor at OWASP AppSec USA.

I am very familiar with the project. I can speak about it in a very
positive light. I dedicate a few slides to it when I speak about intrusion
detection, I can expand that easily....

This is a great idea, Jim.

Colin, John, Dennis and AppSensor team, would you mind if Dennis, or any
other representative from the states, run the AppSensor portion of the
project summit? Is this something you all are interested in participating
in. I got the impression you all were keen, but after reviewing the
messages, I realised there was not definite "yes". I would like to know if
you are interested. Otherwise, I can reach out to another project.

I look forward to your reply.

Sam G.
