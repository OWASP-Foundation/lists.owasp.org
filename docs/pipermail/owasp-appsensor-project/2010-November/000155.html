<PRE>John,

Do you have a moment let us know exactly what part of AppSensor, ESAPI uses?

It's its a pain to review all this, kick it back to me and I'll dig.

Thanks John,
Jim

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Michael,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I just watched your AppSec USA 2010 video presentation about AppSensor&amp;  ESAPI
</I>&gt;<i>     yesterday. (Thanks for the credit as contributor BTW. Totally unexpected.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In it, you mentioned that it was planned to have appsensor.jar bundled with
</I>&gt;<i>     ESAPI as of ESAPI 2.0rc8. Since I don't see it in ESAPI even in 2.0rc10,
</I>&gt;<i>     I'm guessing that there was a delay for some reason.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I copied Jim on this email b/c he was discussing this with us.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> personally am not sure what's required on the ESAPI side to get 
</I>&gt;<i> AppSensor bundled. I can say AppSensor depends on ESAPI in some of 
</I>&gt;<i> it's code (ESAPI is a maven dependency of AppSensor).  I would be 
</I>&gt;<i> happy to do whatever I can to get it included in the bundle.  Jim, any 
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So then I go to look for the AppSensor tutorial and the AppSensor jar file
</I>&gt;<i>     at the AppSensor Google Code site and I don't find either. (The tutorial is
</I>&gt;<i>     under '/' of the trunk under the svn/trunk though, so I did get it.) But
</I>&gt;<i>     surprisingly (to me, at least) was the fact that I could not find appsensor.jar
</I>&gt;<i>     anywhere under the featured or previous Downloads. (Do you expect people to
</I>&gt;<i>     build it from scratch?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now, there are 3 ways to get the jar, and I agree this should be 
</I>&gt;<i> reorganized ... we all admit documentation is our next hurdle.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> first is to build from scratch as you mentioned, unpalatable to most.  
</I>&gt;<i> The second is to grab the jar from the link on 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_Developer_Guide.">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_Developer_Guide.</A>  The third 
</I>&gt;<i> is to add it as a maven dependency - AppSensor is in Maven central 
</I>&gt;<i> (same as ESAPI as of 2.0RC10.  We really do need to move towards 
</I>&gt;<i> producing a deliverable similar to ESAPI that is a zip w/ the 
</I>&gt;<i> jar/dependencies/javadoc/config files, etc. in a zip or something like 
</I>&gt;<i> that, but we're not there yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Anyway, the reason that I am bringing this up is that I am about ready to
</I>&gt;<i>     start working on the ESAPI crypto for the 2.1 branch and I see many places
</I>&gt;<i>     where I'd like to wire-in AppSensor detection points into either JavaEncryptor
</I>&gt;<i>     or perhaps even EncryptionException. If AppSensor was truly bundled as part of
</I>&gt;<i>     ESAPI that would be fairly easy to do. OTOH, if it is not, I may need to
</I>&gt;<i>     rethink this because I don't want to create yet another dependency on an
</I>&gt;<i>     external class library. (ESAPI already has something like 30+ jars that it
</I>&gt;<i>     is dependent upon.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Glad you're thinking of going this way, again, I'd need to talk to Jim 
</I>&gt;<i> about bundling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Lastly, from your AppSec USA 2010 video, I recall you stating that that the
</I>&gt;<i>     way that AppSensor would be enabled in ESAPI would be to set
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ESAPI.IntrusionDetector=org.owasp.appsensor.intrusiondetection.AppSensorIntrusionDetector
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     in the ESAPI.properties file. However, I also vaguely recall discussion
</I>&gt;<i>     as to how that property should not be used as that would disable
</I>&gt;<i>     ESAPI's built-in WAF and I thought that I remember Jeff Williams arguing that
</I>&gt;<i>     AppSensor and the ESAPI WAF were _complimentary_ rather than _competing_
</I>&gt;<i>     technologies so therefore they should use different properties in ESAPI.
</I>&gt;<i>     Anyway, I am not sure that this has been resolved or not, so would appreciate
</I>&gt;<i>     an update in this area as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This will probably have to be cleared up with Jeff and/or Jim.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> haven't seen anything in the intrusion detector code that says 
</I>&gt;<i> anything about the WAF, but I could be wrong.  I agree with Jeff's 
</I>&gt;<i> core point, but if that configuration is true, then I think the 
</I>&gt;<i> current setup is confusing.  The WAF should have separate 
</I>&gt;<i> configuration.  I wouldn't necessarily hook the WAF into the intrusion 
</I>&gt;<i> detection config, since some folks would want to use one or the other.
</I>&gt;<i> Also wanted to point out that in addition to changing that 1-line 
</I>&gt;<i> config, you do need to add the appsensor.properties file (goes in the 
</I>&gt;<i> same folder as the esapi.properties), and make sure the config is 
</I>&gt;<i> right there.  That config file is in svn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>     -kevin
</I>&gt;<i>     P.S.- If you wish to reply to the OWASP-AppSensor-Project mailing list, that's
</I>&gt;<i>            fine as I subscribe to that. Just wasn't sure if this was to appropriate
</I>&gt;<i>            to ask this there as I'm not sure if that's a developers list or a users
</I>&gt;<i>            list.
