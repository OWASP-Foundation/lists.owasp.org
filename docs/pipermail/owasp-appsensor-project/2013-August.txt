Hello AppSensor Team,

Colin has asked me to inform you that you currently have an opportunity to
submit a proposal for grant funding from the Department of Homeland
Security. See the HOST Website <http://www.cyber.st.dhs.gov/host/> for
more information. Additionally, see the grant page for more information on
the grant opportunity <http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/ctisl/host>.

Please have a look and let me know if this is something you are interested
in pursuing. Additionally, please share any ideas you may have on
objectives, and activities that you would like to take part in for
AppSensor with Grant support, if awarded.

Thank you,

SG.

I have discussed this a little with Samantha.  Apparently there is an
opportunity to fund marketing, promotion, reviewing, development, and
writing expense, but not for example travel.

A couple of suggestions:

1.  fund a competition for the best implementation, demonstrations,
supporting applications (e.g. $5,000 first, three $2000 runners up and
five $1,000s plus some admin costs for running it?)

2.  pay to print and distribute further copies of the upcoming v2
Guide (e.g. to give them away at developer events, perhaps in the US
only?)

But we have an opportunity to write this by end of tomorrow and submit
for 2013, or wait a year and do it in 2014. I think we should put some
sort of bid in, the question is what for. I can spend some time
tomorrow writing up, if other contributors on this list can provide a
steer as to what they think is achievable and might gain support. I
think both of the ideas above avoid paying volunteers.

Colin

I personally like the #2 idea. Getting the concept out is helpful, and
seems like it would be very helpful, particularly within govt. circles.

I really like the idea of sample applications using the implementation.
>From a development perspective, I also think it could be useful to build a
reporting front-end for analysis by end-users. I am working on the engine
piece and have a good handle on that, but the visualization of the data is
probably an area that could use some love. However, these dev tasks might
be a stretch to start now.

If our proposal were accepted, when would the work begin? I think if the
work started after the new year, I'd be comfortable proposing any of the
dev ideas, but if sooner, I'd say go with just the documentation.

Hire professional graphic designers to give the book & project that 
'very distinct' professional look you see in projects like OWASP SAMM, 
Mozilla, and Suricata. It sounds small, but the minute we do that a 
whole new world opens up because AppSensor is perceived as a 
'professional tool' around for the long run.

To John's point about reporting and visualization - we have similar issues on the ModSecurity front. Considering that we have implemented many AppSensor detection points within the OWASP ModSecurity CRS. We currently mainly use a tool called the audit console and it accepts ModSecurity audit log data. 

http://www.jwall.org/web/audit/console/index.jsp

You can search and sort in a variety of ways however in general I feel that there is much to do with regards to making these events meaningful for a security analyst. 

I don't really like the per- transaction views of most WAF alert data. I prefer more of an attacker-sequence view that shows paths of attacks or profiles the attacker a bit more. I actually like what Mykonos did with their dashboard - http://www.mykonossoftware.com/profile-the-attacker.php

I guess my point is that I agree that we need a better dashboard for these events but I am not sure if building one from scratch is the best use of time and resources. We could consider contributing to Audit Console to add features we need.

I have the impression, the view is to apply for some funding to held
the guide now (today!), and plan on thinking about support for
application/tool in 2014.


I will work on this 2-6pm UK time (GMT+1) and upload for comment.

I have written a draft proposal which is viewable/editable here:

   https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1cmaHsVrNeqr_dDV3oiCCHJBs4vi3LolpgFtGnelHKEg/edit

It is based primarily on the suggestion to get some additional design
support now (and perhaps bid for something else next year) to
professionalize the project's look and feel, and thus help promote
adoption. Therefore it seeks $15,000 for help to create designs for
the book cover, layout and figures and design/create/print a flyer
leaflet. The previous successful bid for funds for the OWASP Guides
project included $10,000 for design work just on "creation of software
engineering diagrams".

Any review/input welcome. Samantha will need a final version by the
end of today (Tuesday, somewhere in the US time) so that it can be
approved and submitted tomorrow (Wednesday). The current verson
includes residual gray instructional text that will need to be deleted
prior to submission.

I really like this Colin,

  I scanned through the document in about 15 minutes.

   The only thought I had was to mention in 2-- Project Summary, that Web
Applications are one of the primary targets for App Sensor. I'm not sure
of the technical ability of the person reading the proposals, and they
might not see the connection?

  Great stuff!

Thank you, Colin. Yes, please do let me know if all agree to this proposal.
I can them move forward with my finalisation work on it before submission.

I just had a read through. Looks really good!

I added my text in the document and noted them with comments. Feel free to
adjust as needed.

Nice work!

Thanks. Your suggestions are all good and now incorporated, and I have
resolved the comments.

I have now also removed the grey instructional text.

Well done, Team! This looks fantastic! I will work on this tonight in
preparation for your morning. That way, you all can look through it before
submission. I just need to make a few additions and format the document.

Thank you all for your hard work on this.

Hello Colin and All,

I have gone ahead and created a final draft for your review. You all did an
excellent job. There wasn't much for me to do aside from doing an overall
spell check, a word count of each question, and I just made sure all of the
questions were answered. I had to alter a few things here and there, but I
commented them so you can review them before I submit. Please have a look,
and let me know if you would like me to go ahead with submission.

Hi Ryan, hi all!

I obviously like the idea of extending the AuditConsole with regard to the tracking
you mentioned. In fact, I have been preparing for session tracking the received events
some versions ago and the console itself provides an API for plugging in custom modules
as well.

The main task I see here is to come up with reasonable methodologies to do a session
based analysis of the data. If you carefully read through the mykonos post, you'll see
several steps involved:

   (1) provide a method for determining the attacker session
       (session tracking by IP, Cookies, whatever)

   (2) extract identifiable features during step (1) which allow for subsequent
       events to be associated with the identified attacker

   (3) An API for accessing the sessions and their associated information.

   (4) A method for generating nice names :-)


Part of (3) has already been integrated into the AuditConsole. Anyone volunteering for
step (4)? ;-)


I see the biggest issues with (1) and (2). Not from an implementation point of view,
but from a data analyst's POV. I'd be highly interested in collaborating here, as we
already do data analysis at the department I am employed.
My biggest concern here is the availability of data to develop and proper evaluate 
steps (1) and (2).


Regards,
     Chris

Hi Samantha,

We've received your AppSensor application and have added it to our review
queue. Award notifications will be sent October 1st, 2013. As always,
please feel free to contact us if you have any questions. I have CC'd
investments at opencybersecurity.org because we are phasing it in as our
primary investments email list.


Best Regards,

Victor Kuechler
