<PRE>The presentation went well. Brief summary at:

   <A HREF="http://www.clerkendweller.com/2011/2/18/BCS-London-Central-and-OWASP">http://www.clerkendweller.com/2011/2/18/BCS-London-Central-and-OWASP</A>

Although London Central has about 10,000 associated BCS members, there
was hardly any knowledge about OWASP in the audience.  They are all
highly qualified IT professionals:

  &quot;Our mission as BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT (formerly known
as British Computer Society),
   is to enable the information society. We promote wider social and
economic progress through
   the advancement of information technology science and practice.

    We bring together industry, academics, practitioners and
government to share knowledge,
    promote new thinking, inform the design of new curricula, shape
public policy and
    inform the public.

    Our vision is to be a world-class organisation for IT. Our 70,000
strong membership includes
    practitioners, businesses, academics and students in the UK and
internationally.&quot;

So we (OWASP in the UK) aren't doing so well on the awareness front,
even to quite a closely related professional sector.

I had a about 20 mins on AppSensor which some of the audience seemed
very interested in.  One tweet:

    AppSensor frm #OWASP makes Access Control look so lame w/ no requirements
    4 detection points #Smart #bcslcb #ApplicationSecurity #Tech

At the end, someone said they thought the (Michael's) four slides
about why traditional application protection measures (SSL, firewals,
DPI and WAFs) don't work would have been great as the first slides in
the presentation (instead of in the middle).

There was also particular interest in SAMM, and yes Zed Attack Proxy.
