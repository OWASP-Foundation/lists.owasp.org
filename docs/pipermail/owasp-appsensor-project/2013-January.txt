Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Book v2 - Case studies
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBnSwtmaxxu+-TPu_nwvaZOt9HdDFFWNhwFNJrn6rOfjUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

(resend as the last attempt appeared to fail)

I am progressing with some content for a new version of the AppSensor
book. One of the aspects that was identified for inclusion were some
short example case studies to help get people started thinking about
what they could do with their own software applications. The draft
list of case studies, which will be 1-2 pages each, is:

 1.      Rapidly deployed web application
 2.      Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce website (initial)
 3.      Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce website (extended)
 4.      Magazine?s mobile application
 5.      Social media web application
 6.      Smart grid consumer meter
 7.      B2B web services

I have drafted the first two, and have some ideas for the third
already, but wondered if anyone would like to have a go at creating
one of the others, or any other ideas? The intention is to provide
lots of ideas, but not make it sound too complex - we might want to
move No2/3 down to the end of the list.

My first two are in a PDF at:

    https://www.owasp.org/images/d/d3/Owasp-appsensor2-tempfile.pdf

I can send a Word document to anyone interested.

Colin,
As usual - great work. I'll try my hand at #4 and #8. Could you send me a
separate email with the word doc or a template for just these sections?

Thanks,
John

I am drafting out sections of the v2 AppSensor book and want to make
sure we acknowledge all the project's contributors correctly. I have
attached (hopefully a 34k PDF will get through) a draft page.

- Is everyone on it who should be?
- Are the names correct, and written in full?
- Does anyone listed not want to be mentioned?

I gathered the information from this mailing list, my own
correspondence and participants of the OWASP summit in 2011.

Regards

Colin

:-)

I was hoping we might have some contributors with family names
beginning with letters other than mainly B, C, L, M, R, T and W.

Hi Colin,

I did set up a leanpub account and started the OWASP Press project with
this AppSensor book specifically in mind.
This allows us to github the book source and push our changes around to
each other. This allows virtually anybody to pitch in and help, by forking
and pushing back the changes. I remain highly motivated and interested in
AppSensor; but I am working at a new position and working on my AppSensor
slides for AppSec Korea. I have a bunch of work done on the book that I
haven't pushed out so we should sync.

That sounds exciting. I hadn't read your December blog post
http://scriptogr.am/dennis-groves/post/owasp-press about it - sorry.
When we chatted last year, I tried Scrivenor or just writing the book
on the wiki, but found the support for including diagrams, structured
tables and references was not good enough. So, although I normally use
Open Office, I started writing in Word ? OWASP's wiki doesn't allow OO
files to be uploaded :-( ? and understand the limitations on
collaboration of doing this, but wanted to format images and data as I
went. I did start from a Lulu-provided template so that it would fit
the output of many of the existing OWASP books, and once finished,
thought we could convert it into wiki pages.

But LeanPub's workflow sounds interesting, and its multi-format output
support looks promising.

Does it support embedded diagram images (maybe as SVG?) and complex
tabulated data? I didn't just want to create tables elsewhere (in
another application) as images, since people can't copy and paste the
content or update it easily, and I believe multi-format output can
sometimes make a real hash of tables. How does it work in Leanpub? I
downloaded Dinis' blog conversion PDF (900 pages, 50Mb) and saw how
hyperlinks occur as footnotes (but not as full references) and there
are embedded screen shots from the blog page contents. But no tables
of information?


>I have a bunch of work done on the book that I

I didn't know about that. Does that match any sections in the draft
contents list developed at the summit and reworked in the document I
sent in August?

Hi

Fabio Cerullo has encouraged Dinis Cruz and myself to submit a
workshop proposal for Security B-Sides London in April. The proposed
title is "Visualising AppSensor behaviour via O2 Platform
WebAutomation Scripts". We should hear within a week or two if our
proposal is successful.
