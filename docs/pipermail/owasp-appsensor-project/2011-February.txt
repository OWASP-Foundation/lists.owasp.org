Just a note to say the competition organizers moved the closing date
for entries back from the 31st January to 28th February.  I
subsequently re-opened our entry and added another example (online
banking by a malware infected user) and a link to the new online demo.
 The entry has now been submitted again.

This evening I am giving a talk about OWASP at the BCS' London Central branch:

http://www.londoncentral.bcs.org/events/forthcoming-events.php

It's a talk in three parts:

1. About OWASP
2. Overview of some OWASP projects
3. More detail about one project

And No 3 is going to be about AppSensor (of course).

Message-ID: <AANLkTimcPkf90hqaHHv6E-D30d34ugoW7XmqH9LvNKkx@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I hesitate to suggest something else to do, but I had an email from
the US DHS Software Assurance (SwA) Community about CrossTalk, the
Journal of Defense Software Engineering.  They have an upcoming issue
which I thought might be worth writing an AppSensor article for:

-------------------------

The September/October 2011 theme is "Protecting Against Predatory Practices"

Articles due 08 April 2011

Wireless network sniffing and probing, denial of service, forged
de-authentications, and phishing are some of the more well-known
predatory practices the DoD has come to expect?but new, larger, and
more orchestrated attacks such as ?ghost networks? have recently come
to the attention of anti-cyberterrorist experts. CrossTalk is
exploring the most recent dangers our community faces and
methodologies used to protect information against cyber espionage.
Articles will explore the latest threats, security measures, software
security automation, and even social networking dangers.

Crosstalk magazine: http://www.crosstalkonline.org/
Issue themes: http://www.crosstalkonline.org/theme-calendar/
Author guidelines: http://www.crosstalkonline.org/submission-guidelines/

-------------------------

I'm happy to do some of the effort, but can anyone else help and act
as senior/co-authors in the next month?

I plan to provide a more detailed email when I get things back under control here, but I wanted to let everyone know that the AppSensor session at the OWASP world summit went really well.  We had a packed house of about 50-75 people and had a great discussion on where the project should go next.

I'm excited about the new data and focus areas and am also looking for people that would like to be involved in the project more.

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Announcing Real-time Application
	Profiling with ModSecurity
Message-ID: <C982F050.1A18D%ryan.barnett@owasp.org>

Hey guys,
I wanted to send out this note to the group as I have just added an
important new capability to the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)
Project - real?time application profiling.  I worked on this a bit while at
the Global Summit last week.  I was inspired after the AppSensor dynamic
working session to try and get this capability added to the project.  What
is great is that now we map more CRS items directly to AppSensor detection
points!

This initial version of the rules has the ability to profile and enforce the
following on a per-resource basis:
* Request Method(s)
* Number of Parameters
* Parameter Names
* Parameter Length Ranges
* Parameter Types - numeric or alpha
One of my main goals for this effort was to help reduce the attack surface
of SQLi attacks that exploit numeric parameter fields.  The auto-generated
input validation for numeric fields will help to prevent successful
exploitation.

Here is my blog post on this new release -
http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2011/02/modsecurity-advanced-topic-of-the-week-re
al-time-application-profiling.html

Cheers,
Ryan

The presentation went well. Brief summary at:

   http://www.clerkendweller.com/2011/2/18/BCS-London-Central-and-OWASP

Although London Central has about 10,000 associated BCS members, there
was hardly any knowledge about OWASP in the audience.  They are all
highly qualified IT professionals:

  "Our mission as BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT (formerly known
as British Computer Society),
   is to enable the information society. We promote wider social and
economic progress through
   the advancement of information technology science and practice.

    We bring together industry, academics, practitioners and
government to share knowledge,
    promote new thinking, inform the design of new curricula, shape
public policy and
    inform the public.

    Our vision is to be a world-class organisation for IT. Our 70,000
strong membership includes
    practitioners, businesses, academics and students in the UK and
internationally."

So we (OWASP in the UK) aren't doing so well on the awareness front,
even to quite a closely related professional sector.

I had a about 20 mins on AppSensor which some of the audience seemed
very interested in.  One tweet:

    AppSensor frm #OWASP makes Access Control look so lame w/ no requirements
    4 detection points #Smart #bcslcb #ApplicationSecurity #Tech

At the end, someone said they thought the (Michael's) four slides
about why traditional application protection measures (SSL, firewals,
DPI and WAFs) don't work would have been great as the first slides in
the presentation (instead of in the middle).

There was also particular interest in SAMM, and yes Zed Attack Proxy.

That sounds good.  Please do update them, otherwise I might have to do
it!  Some of the larger chunks (like XSS and SQLi) just have a general
pointer and the total number of rules, since there too many to list
explicitly.

Thanks for pointing this out.  Now what if AppSensor could receive a
grant of 0.1% (of $500 Million)?  That is $500,000.

Does anyone know how to monitor Pentagon calls for research, studies
and other projects?

Hello

It's the AppSensor "PR Department" here again... there's an awards
process coming up:

   Counter Terrorism and Specialist Security Awards
   http://www.ctssawards.com/pages/overview.cfm

   Rules
   http://www.ctssawards.com/pages/rules.cfm

I've nominated/voted for "OWASP AppSensor" in the two categories:

   Perimeter Protection and Intrusion Detection
   http://www.ctssawards.com/pages/cat4.cfm

   Cyber Security and Electronic Security
   http://www.ctssawards.com/pages/cat7.cfm

and would encourage others to do the same.  You aren't allowed to vote
for "your own company".  I submitted my votes under my company
name/address/email.  There doesn't seem to be any hurdle for voting
(other than providing your name and contact details), and nowhere to
explain the entry further.  Perhaps the organisers will come back and
ask?

The AppSensor session at the OWASP World Summit was a great success. The focus of the discussion was where should AppSensor go next.  We covered all of the available items within the AppSensor project (AppSensor.jar w/ESAPI plugin, detection points guidance, extensive documentation, live running demos defendtheapp.com, etc) and posed the question "What do we need for your company to adopt AppSensor within your applications".  There was lots of energy in the room and all 50+ seats were filled.  AppSensor is really starting to take off and I'm excited at these results.  These ideas represent the next areas for the project to tackle in order to obtain wide adoption.

Here are the outputs of that discussion as action items for the project.  Consider this an invitation for anyone to jump into the AppSensor project and lead one of these areas to success (email me and I can give you more info and support your efforts)

* Concern over False Positives 
** Article to discuss why AppSensor false positives won't result in negative system performance or adversely impact non-malicious users. Target Audience: Product Managers, CSOs

* Where is AppSensor integrated into development
** Slides or article to demonstrate process of selecting AppSensor detection points during the threat modeling phase. Notes on how to communicate these requirements to developers. How to test proper deployment

* Is there an AppSensor-like implementation that could be handled by operations?
** This is not the traditional AppSensor approach (e.g. within the code), but we could do further research on aspect oriented implementations or real time log analysis for attack monitoring

* Integration with libraries and frameworks
** Sub project to submit patches for common frameworks to log obvious attack types. The goal is to at least get the logging of attack scenarios in place by default. This makes it easier to adopt an AppSensor approach onto these libraries or frameworks
** Possible first target : Sonar (sonarsource.org) - May need to get more info on this idea

* Testimonials from companies using AppSensor or AppSensor-like capabilities
** This wil help raise confidence in the project for potential new adopters

* Software - Code versioning, patching, support ?
** This is a common concern for open source software and OWASP code. What can we do to help make our code more digestible by a company looking for these more stringent development patterns?

* Link in with Fraud systems
** The AppSensor project has been contacted by a large bank to help develop a strategy for detection of fraud through session hijacking and phishing.
