Tom will be posting some further information on the cyber fast-track
process to the leaders list shortly.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project/DARPA
http://www.darpa.mil/Opportunities/Solicitations/I2O_Solicitations.aspx

It seems DARPA are very interested in funding research/projects in
many areas, and this might range from $10,000 to $5million. OWASP
might help project leaders to apply themselves, but can't pay anyone.
So there might be an opportunity for someone, or a team, to bid for
self-funding, and then donate the work back to OWASP.

So, perhaps some opportunities there for paying for some development?
