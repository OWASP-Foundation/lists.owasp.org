Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] v2.0.0-RC1 released
Message-ID: <CAM8z=yLZQOp-GJpXo_NCiBDrL5ce1FETQYNUPkBUrYBd8kds7g@mail.gmail.com>

All,
We just released 2.0.0-RC1. This is the first release candidate for
2.0.0 final. There will be at least 1 more. More info is here:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/releases/tag/v2.0.0-RC1.

There are 3 main updates:
1. A bug was fixed in the event manager api
(https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/issues/13)
2. Apache Thrift was added as an additional option for an execution
mode (in addition to rest/soap)
3. The website was updated, particularly the documentation
(http://appsensor.org/documentation.html) and v2 design decisions
(http://appsensor.org/v2-design.html) pages

There will be at least one more release candidate (with more as needed
for any bugs), with a v2 final going out in November.

As always, happy to hear any feedback.

Thanks,
John
