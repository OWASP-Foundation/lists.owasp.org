All,
Just a heads up I'll be going to the Northern Virginia (East Coast,
US) OWASP chapter next week (March 14) to give a talk on AppSensor.
I'll be covering the basics of AppSensor, a demo and covering the
plans and progress for the next version of AppSensor from a
code/architecture perspective. If you're in the area, come on out.

Thanks,
John

Thought folks would find this link interesting: It's related to the
recent buzz about VUPEN's exploits against Google Chrome at the
pwn2own competition. Read the short story - sounds a lot like an
appsensor like (or at least signature based) detection.

Dear Team OWASP,


I am very excited to contribute in open source community through the
platform of GSoC 2012. Last year, I contributed "Debugger Visualizers" to
MonoDevelop which had successfully become a part of Mono Develop.



I have seen project ideas for GSoC 2012 at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSoC2012_Ideas#AppSensor. I am interested
in "*SOAP web service server implementation*" for AppSensor. The reason for
my interest is that I have good working experience of web services
(SOAP/REST/Axis2), Java, Servlets and related technologies.



My understanding of the requirements is as follows:



1. Coordinate with the REST team to develop a common standard that will be
used in the SOAP/REST Web service development.

1. Implement a Soap based Web service using Java.

2. The Web service will expose AppSensor engine's functionality via WSDL.

3. The Web service shall talk to AppSensor core engine and will be consumed
by AppSensor clients to utilise the functionality of AppSensor

4. Liaise with other GSoC project (Project 003) to expose the web service
to clients.



Are you going to work on Axis2 to implement this web service?


Your kind feedback would help me in better recognising the core project
requirements and develop a good proposal.


Regards,



Rauf

who is the AppSensor mentor and will surely clear all your questions.

Rauf,
Thanks very much for the interest in appsensor for the GSOC program.

1. Just a clarifying point. There are a couple of features the SOAP
services will expose - the engine (which you listed) and the reporting
features.
2. To your question about using Axis2: I'm the dev lead, and I
honestly haven't decided. I was leaning towards using the web services
built into Spring since I plan on using that for the REST
implementation as well. I'm not necessarily opposed to using something
else, but I'd have to think about it a bit. The only real requirement
is that the web services library has support for the WS-I Basic
Security Profile (BSP), which I think Axis2 does.

Hopefully I answered your question well, but if you have any further
questions, please feel free to contact me anytime.
Thanks,
John

Team,
I am the chapter leader of the OWASP Guadalajara; I am also studying a
Master Degree in Information Technology and I want to know if I can
participate on the AppSensor Project as part of my thesis to get the degree.
I am interested on policy development as well as the development of the
theoretical approach; even though I have not coded to much in the recent
years, I may help with it in the future once I get more involved in the
project.
Please let me know where to start and how I can contribute.

Thanks!

Manuel,
Hi - Thanks for your enthusiasm! I lead up development work on
AppSensor. Michael Coates is the project lead and Colin Watson is also
another leader on the project over various efforts (sounds like these
guys would be better to help you given what you're focus areas are).
We've had significant contributions from other folks as well. It's a
great project with a great group of folks. Glad to hear you're
interested in joining. Let me know if you get to a point where you'd
like to talk about coding work, and I'll be happy to work with you.

Thanks,
John

Hello Manuel

Thank you for becoming involved. We are in the process of beginning to
write an updated AppSensor book, so there are plenty of opportunities
to contribute in the areas you suggest. As John says, if you want to
do coding, he's probably the best person to liaise with.

Maybe we can have a chat by phone some time? I am in the UK, so some
time later one afternoon here might work?

Message-ID: <CA+wR77oi17yxNNnMzXWFtpzbR69fiqUXOCw9sbK_3cy-OQ6GKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone

First please forgive the possible inapropriatness of the subject.(and
any misuse of the language) I know there is a gsoc mailing list but
since the idea submissions end in 3 days I thought it would be better
to post on the developpers list.

Secondly please let me introduce myself
My name is Spyros Gasteratos, i'm a member of the Greek Chapter and  i
study computer science at the university of Athens.

I propose integrating into appsensor the idea described in this paper
by Dr. Vasileios Vlachos
http://www.spinellis.gr/pubs/jrnl/2004-CompSec-p2pav/html/VAS04.html


In a nutshell I think that this idea can increase the communication
between different web applications connected with each other and in
the end increase the effectiveness of the project.

If you think this is a good idea a second proposal is to somehow
involve Vasileios in the coding/mentoring process since he is the
original author.

Awaiting feedback.

Spyros,
Thanks very much for the link. For a few reasons, I think I'd prefer
to not go forward with this proposal.
1. Many of the ideas in here already have functional equivalents
already built into AppSensor (detection, response, trend analysis)
2. AppSensor is meant to be very specific and have no/low false
positive rates, whereas this system seems to do more trend analysis
3. This system seems to look at system level issues (firewall,
NIDS/HIDS) whereas we are looking for specific attacks against an
application
4. This system appears to be built on a binary-style communication
protocol, whereas we'll need to support some web-service style model
for enterprise consumption

This proposal definitely looks very interesting, but I imagine it will
probably fit other systems better than appsensor. Thanks very much for
bringing it to our attention.

Thanks,
John

Hello,

My name is Cosmin Stefan-Dobrin and I am a student at the Politechnics
University of Bucharest, Computer Science faculty. I am an extremely
passionate programmer (and soon-to-be engineer), who's always interested in
the latest technologies and latest trends in IT development. I am
interested in applying for Google Summer Of Code 2012, and the projects
proposed by OWASP (and particularly AppSensor) are extremely interesting.
I'm a fast learner and I have quite a lot of experience in Java, Android,
C/C++, HTML, CSS, JS, SOAP/REST principles, Google Appengine and using
git/svn as I've worked on numerous projects at the university and on my
spare time (one of the biggest projects I've recently worked on is
www.feedrz.com, which is only at its beginnings and which I have developed
with a friend, during the free time).

I am interested in working on AppSensor during the GSOC. Some of the
proposed tasks ( *"**REST web service server implementation**"*, *"SOAP web
service server implementation**"* and "*SOAP/REST web service client
implementation*") have particularly caught my attention, altough they're
not the only AppSensor projects that seem interesting. I have some
experience with REST, SOAP and web services as I have used both of them
(both server-side and client-side) on some projects I developed in the
past. I have to say that, if I have to choose, I would go with REST
(because of more experience). Anyway, I would like to know what should I do
next (in the following days), to get better connected to the project? And,
I am going to ask pretty straight and honest, which of the projects is the
most important for AppSensor, as I would be interested in helping you with
what you need most.

Regarding the projects, I would also have 1 question (for now):



   - The developer for the web-server implementation (for let's say REST)
   will also do/or help the web-client for that service type?

Thank you and have a wonderful day,
Cosmin

Cosmin,

Thanks very much for your interest in the project! I'm the lead
developer on appsensor. Looks like you have some good experience that
you could contribute to the project. As for getting connected to the
project, I'd suggest you take a look at the book (linked off this
page: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project). It
will describe a lot of the principles in detail if you're interested.
Also, feel free to pull down the source from google code (svn). As for
what is most important to us in the update, I'd say the soap/rest
service/client implementations are definitely the largest and most
important tasks. One thing I did want to point out, though, is that
both the "client" and "server" pieces will be application servers.
There is no user interface development to what we're building. This is
all back-end communication and building services to expose data (the
reporting services).

If you're interested in submitting for the project, use the google
link to submit your proposal. OWASP provided a sample proposal you can
use as a basis.

Looking forward to working with you if everything works out! If you
have any further questions, feel free to respond to the list or me
directly.

Thanks,
John

Hi,

My name is Dimitris and I'm an IT student from Greece. I'd like to  
introduce and ask some info about the AppSensor project and some  
points regarding my application for GSoC. I'm very interested to get  
involved with this project whether it is as part of GSoC or not.

At first I've subscribed at your project's mailing list and then I  
joined your irc room with the nickname "vervas". I've also made a  
checkout from the subversion repository but I'm more familiar with  
GIT, so I wonder if it is better to have a look at subversion or set  
up a GIT repository.

At this point I check the tutorials and other material related to the  
project trying to get a taste, as I wasn't involved in the past. Any  
suggestions about where to focus my attention on are welcome.

If there is something that I have to know about the project, or other  
stuff that I have to take care of before writing and submitting my  
application please let me know.

Thank you,
Dimitris

Very good. Glad to meet you (virtually) and glad to hear you're
excited about the project.

The mailing list is used. To my knowledge, IRC is not - at least I
never use it. We have the current version of the code in subversion.
I'm not sure where the new version of the code will be (might be git),
but for the time being, we're using svn.

If you're wanting to learn about the project in general, look at the
book (https://www.owasp.org/images/2/2f/OWASP_AppSensor_Beta_1.1.pdf).
If you want to learn about the code, pull the code down and have a
look. You can also check out the dev guide
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_Developer_Guide)

In my opinion, you should know Java. You should understand the basics
of security. You should at least briefly read the basics of intrusion
detection (just to get an idea about it). Depending on what you plan
to try and work on, you might want to read about web services (using
SOAP and/or REST). I wouldn't necessarily spend a lot of time on these
(except Java), but it will help to at least introduce yourself to the
concepts.

Message-ID: <CAFhWcS7+Y4pu0+hzK3Fe87M9XaQNy9ACQwAjyK+VhdB01dJh2w@mail.gmail.com>

Good evening Mr. Melton,
My name is Antonis Gogotsis Tserkezopoulos and i am an IT student from
ATEI(Alexander Technological Institute)of thessaloniki.I am sending this
e-mail in order to express my interest on the Google Summer of Code and the
project of Appsencor.

I am monitoring the App-sencor Project for the last year ever since i first
joined to the OWASP as an individual but i have not been able to offer
anything to the community and the project.I am mainly interested on
App-sencor because my goals towards future career are computer security
oriented.
My knowledge includes:
the standard knowledge of java and some other obeject orientted languages
as well as HTML/CCS/Javascipt and PHP,
a general knowledge on A.I. including programming in prolog and some neural
networking algorithms,
and this year i am studying to get my CCNA certification and my thesis:
"Intrusion Detection Systems in Social Networks" which the first reason i
started following the App-sencor project.

Unfortunately i have no knowledge of ESAPI and its functions yet.
I realize its a bit late for any proposal so in conclusion i am very
intersted in attending and expanding the current App-sencor especially
under the Project 004 that evolves around Detection Implementation.

With Regards,
Antonis

Nice to meet you - glad to hear of your interest in appsensor.

That's ok. ESAPI is actually a fairly small library, and you should be
able to understand it reasonably quickly if you understand Java. Also,
ESAPI knowledge is not really required for project 4 anyhow. As long
as you know Java, and understand security, it shouldn't require much
more than that.

Hello
With what commands i can reset the appsesnor for a user and clear all
attack history? Also how i can see in what security level is now the
appsensor for the user(i mean log attack, log out, disable etc)?
Thank you very much

Manolis,
Neither of these use cases are currently supported. You could add some
code to do these fairly easily, but there's nothing there that will do
it out of the box.
Thanks,
John

Hi,



I hope it is not too late to contact the members of this group, especially,
John Melton of the AppSensor group.



I am a Graduate Student in University of Toledo and working in Threat
Analysis and Modeling of various Networks.



I am interested in working for the Project 006 of the AppSensor group ?
Trend Monitoring.



Please guide me how should I proceed? Should I send my proposal to the list?
