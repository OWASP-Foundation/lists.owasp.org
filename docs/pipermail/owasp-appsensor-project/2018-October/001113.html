<PRE>Hello,

I'm just checking out AppSensor and I'm excited about the idea. Thank you for all the efforts you spend doing such great work!

I followed the instructions for the Demo Setup, running MySQL in version 5.7. The mentioned &quot;appsensor-ws-rest-server-with-websocket-boot&quot; just runs fine. 

With the sample app &quot;appsensor-ws-rest-server-with-websocket-mysql-boot&quot; I'm having some issues, which I was able to track down. There are problems with the create.sql in the project, since it doesn't create the DDL like expected. Removing the comments in the application.properties, doesn't seem to get the application to create the tables. 
I created the DDL manually then, but had to modify the SQL statements in the create.sql. The main issue is that MySQL is quite picky with keywords. The name of the table &quot;interval&quot; is a reserved keyword and must be used with the right quotes: `interval`. 
Same with the column `key` in table &quot;key_value_pair&quot;. 
Additionally the column type &quot;tinyblob&quot; causes an error during runtime of the application, since the ip_address doesn't fit into the column. Changing that to &quot;blob&quot; helps.

With that changed I'm able to start the application, but during runtime another issue appears: a sql syntax error is reported during the persisting of events. I debugged it and found another problem with the usage of the &quot;interval&quot; table. In the produced SQL statement `interval` is not correctly quoted, causing MySQL's iterpreter to fail.

Maybe someone has the time to go after it and can provide some help. I would highly appreciate it.

Best regards!
Bernhard
