<PRE>Dear all

Further to Jim's perfectly reasonable &quot;cage rattling&quot; a couple of
weeks ago, here is an update.

Since the start of this push, 10 days ago, to publish I have added
more new content to v1.38. In numbers this means the book has grown by
in total 26 extra pages:

- 5,000 new words
- 22 new figures
- 5 new tables
- 2 additional contributors listed (Josh and Erlend)

I went through the version on Google Docs today, but cannot see any
actual edits and new additional text. I only see a score or so
comments. BTW apart from the Preamble, most of the text was drafted by
me alone, so Josh, some of your questions directed at Ryan about use
of a WAF, are really my misunderstandings, mistakes or lack of
clarity.

Version v1.45 is in the usual place linked from the project wiki. I
have also tried to check all the applied styles, and created new
styles for URLs and code samples.

<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appensor-guide-v2.doc">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appensor-guide-v2.doc</A>

The following sections appear to be largely incomplete (and by whom!).
Please forward on any contributions for these, otherwise they will be
dropped from the version for review in a couple of weeks time, when
bulk content addition will then be frozen. If anyone else is able to
write these, perhaps with the exception of the Foreword, that would be
fine too. These sections can of course be added back into a later
edition if they are written subsequently.

[MC] Foreword
[DG] Preamble - About This Guide
[DG] Preamble - How To Use This Book
[CW] Part III - Chapter 16: Software Acquisition Process
[DG] Part III - Chapter 20: Statistical Detection Points
[CW] Part IV - Utilizing Web Analytics
[CW] Reference - File Data Logging Format
[CW] Reference - Index

I am hoping to get the Web Analytics and File Data Logging Format
sections written. But the other two sections with my initials will not
be done in time for this edition.

************
If any of these sections will be written by the end of 17th April,
please let me know and we can defer them to a later edition, and
perhaps progress to the final review period sooner.
************

Can anyone update the Google Docs version? I don't know how to
import/merge/add the changes from v1.45. BTW there are erroneous
artefacts in the Google Doc version that do not exist in the Word
version that was previously uploaded (e.g. the extra &quot;h&quot; at the end of
Chapter 27), in case a difference check is used.

As a reminder, the review period is between the 18th and 30th April.
We will then publish the v2.0 book by 7th May 2014. This will be as a
PDF, in Word, in Google Docs and also as a Lulu print on demand book.

Regards

Colin
