&gt;<i> Colin why don't you join us in editing the google doc?
</I>
Because...

- A Lulu Word template was used as a starting point, to ensure we can
publish to Lulu rapidly at the end
- Goggle Docs is too slow to render on a super-fast computer
- It is clunky to use
- Some useful functionality is completely missing
- The import has broken a lot of the the previously worked on layout
and formatting
- I still seem to be the main writer as there have been only a handful
of edits to the Google Doc (until Ryan started!)
- I have added 2-3 orders of magnitude more content than has been done
so far in Google Docs since it was uploaded there
- v2.0 will be created from the Word document

I am closing off v2.0. After v2.0 you can do what you like!

BTW I would have preferred to use Open Office text document, but the
OWASP wiki doesn't allow that to be uploaded. I have asked a number of
times for that to be changed.


&gt;<i>We an always export
</I>&gt;<i> and make it sexy.
</I>
I/we don't have time to re-do all the existing tables,
cross-referencing and other formatting.


&gt;<i> The whole point of group collaboration is that we all work
</I>&gt;<i> on it together. :-)
</I>
Like I said previously, I'm very happy if people want to edit in
Google Docs, but that I wouldn't be doing that myself. Please don't
force me to do something.  I will pull in all the updates on the 18th
April and again at the end of the review period (1st May).

Colin
