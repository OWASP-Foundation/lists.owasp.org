<PRE>Dear all

Further to the schedule announced to this list a month ago, I am
pleased to release the final review version. This is currently called
v1.5 and is available as usual at:

   <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appensor-guide-v2.doc">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appensor-guide-v2.doc</A>

I have incorporated everything into this v1.5 that I could find that
had changed in the current (18 April) Google Docs file which was based
on v1.39.


Missing parts
-------------------

I am hoping MC will write the foreword. I will complete the empty file
logging format chapter, and replace some of the earlier diagrams with
more legible versions.

Perhaps someone could write the &quot;About This Guide&quot;, and &quot;How To Use
This Guide&quot;, otherwise they will be dropped.

We are aware that DG may not be able to update his introduction, so
perhaps need to decide whether to review/edit it or not. I have not
reviewed it at all.


Review process
----------------------

You can download the Word document and edit it individually with track
changes on. Or send comments, edits, feedback and additions by email,
post or in some other format. You can send thigs to me directly or via
this list. I will aggregate all review feedback on 1st May.

If someone is able to incorporate/merge/update changes into the Google
Docs version, maybe that can also be used for review?

Chapter 1 has been reviewed by some people already, and it would be
nice if people could begin their efforts elsewhere in the document. If
someone wants to create a review log or wiki page to track who looked
at what, that would be very welcome. A lot of the text is mine, and
just because I wrote it, it doesn't mean it is true, accurate,
sensible, understandable or correct. Some parts really do need some
critical review.

Please let me know if you would like me to email you directly with an
alternative format of the document.


Release plan
-------------------

The review period will end on 1st May. I will then publish the v2.0
book by 7th May 2014. This will be as a PDF, in Word and also as a
Lulu book. Further additions and improvements can be made after that
in future versions.


Colin
