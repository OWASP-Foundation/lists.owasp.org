Is there any further action required from OWASP/us at the moment? Do
we know when the funds will be available, the process for using them
and if there is a deadline?

Note: this award is tied to receiving the previously committed $5,000
from the OWASP reboot funds.

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] AppSensor for PCIDSS v3.0 Requirement 6.6?
Message-ID: <CAAxdBB=EZ1p1Vu7ytMArGgpOz9uwhPxc68QCqQ-Q505NmXaeFA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Have you seen PCIDSS v3.0?

   https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php

Requirement 6.6 has been changed:

   "Increased flexibility by specifying automated technical solution
    that detects and prevents web-based attacks rather than
    ?web-application firewall.? Added note to clarify that this assessment
    is not the same as vulnerability scans required at 11.2."

That sounds awfully like AppSensor. The detailed text is:

   "6.6 For public-facing web applications, ensure that either one of the
    following methods is in place as follows:

    * Examine ?

    * Examine the system configuration settings and interview responsible
      personnel to verify that an automated technical solution that detects
      and prevents web-based attacks (for example, a web-application firewall)
      is in place as follows:
      - Is situated in front of public-facing web applications to
detect and prevent web-based attacks.        - Is actively running and
up to date as applicable.
      - Is generating audit logs.
      - Is configured to either block web-based attacks, or generate an alert.

I suspect "in front" could be "inside in front of business logic".

Not being as optimistic as Colin, I asked a friend and former colleague
of mine who happens to be a certified PCI auditor for his company his
interpretation of this.

My sense of why the PCI DSS wording change was altered was to better
accomodate things like Apache's mod_security. Because AppSensor detection
points are generally instrumented by the application development team
rather than a separate security team or operations team, I was skeptical
whether or not PCI auditors would accept AppSensor as satisfying these
PCI DSS 3.0 requirements. Hence my reason for asking my former colleague.
I also asked him if PCI had some sort of central board that could rule on
this should we find that auditors were not accepting AppSensor to address
these PCI requirements.

My friend's response is below. I suggest you read through it. I think
his statement's are encouraging.

> ---------- Forwarded message ----------

What Colin sent is the testing procedures for the new 3.0. The requirement
reads, in part, like this:

    " ...Installing an automated technical solution (emphasis mine) that
    detects and prevents web-based attacks (for example, a web-application
    firewall) in front of public-facing web applications, to continually
    check all traffic".

In this case the WAF was used as an example only and I would think you
could make a case using AppSensor meets these requirements as long as
the other (alerting, blocking, logging) are met too.

In the PCI-DSS 3.0 Summary of Changes document, this is noted as a
clarification of the existing requirement with this note:

    "Increased flexibility by specifying automated technical solution that
    detects and prevents web-based attacks rather than "web-application
    firewall." Added note to clarify that this assessment is not the same
    as vulnerability scans required at 11.2".

[Note from me: So as you can see, my conjecture about this was wrong and
this not added to address things like mod_security.]

Usually clarifying guidance would be done through the FAQs or an Information
Supplement. I?m not sure if the SSC would render an opinion on a specific
technology though. I?ve not submitted a question and would have to investigate
that process. OWASP may have some representation somewhere on the PCI council
since they are referenced in the DSS.

Thank you for getting this feedback. I think perhaps it's something to
discuss in the book (coming soon!). If anyone else has further
viewpoints or insights, please contribute them.

Samantha,

I noticed to AppSensor book is no longer on lulu. Was it removed?

This causes the book link to fail on the top of the appsensor page.

I retired free PDF versions of books from Lulu a month or two ago, so
that people can find the printable versions, and because not all PDFs
we have were on there.  Lulu was not being maintained. No print
versions were retired by me.  We are waiting for peopel to be
available for a discussion (i.e. after AppSec USA) before having a
discussion on some list about how people find books in various
formats, and languages.

Regarding the v1.1 AppSensor book. I think it has disappeared because
Lulu has recently retired some formats:

   http://connect.lulu.com/t5/Lulu-Announcements/Update-Discontinued-Print-Book-Formats/m-p/249775#U249775


The printed book appears in "retired" list bit cannot be published
because Lulu no longer supports that format for the number of
pages/colours. Therefore it cannot be unretired. Presumably OWASP was
notified about this?

I was intending to update the AppSensor project page to the newer
layouts, but will now prioritise that and remove that Lulu link.
Instead I will put a link to the PDF version. So watch out!

In the near future (January?) we ought to have the v2 book, which will
be in a format that Lulu currently supports. The new version is staill
in draft and has never been uploaded to Lulu. It won't be until it is
ready for wider release.

Dear Samantha,

After some considerable discussion it has been determined that the
2013 project awardees should be treated as HOST program subcontractors
under the HOST prime contractor, Georgia Institute Technology Research
Institute. The next step to become a subcontractor is to work directly
with program manager / principal investigator Joshua Davis, copied
here. You should expect to hear from Josh this week (by Friday
November 14th). Then by no later than Monday November 17th you should
expect to receive full instructions and any requisite form to move
forward on becoming an official subcontractor. A contract including
the Statement of Work we recently worked with you to complete will be
included in the final contract.

Although this is more process than anticipated by GTRI earlier this
year, it may be encouraging to know that it will only need to be done
one time should you in the future receive any additional award.

Thanks again for your cooperation and patience. We look forward to
working with you in the coming weeks.

Best Regards,




Deborah Bryant
Principal Consultant Bryant Group and
Investments Lead, Homeland Open Security Technology Program

Dear all

I have refreshed the layout of the project page to match the preferred
arrangement:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project

I have not altered any content, although it has been re-arranged and
thumbnail images of the v1.1 book and CrossTalk article have been
added. I hope this looks a little better for the moment. We can review
and update the content over the next few months, and perhaps draw on
copy created for the v2 Guide.

Remember there are AppSensor activities and a presentation at AppSec
USA next week:

1. AppSensor 2.0 Hackathon code writing, John Melton, Monday 18th
November at 1:00pm - 5:00pm (Sky Lounge, 16th floor)


2. Writing and Documentation Review Session for documentation projects
including AppSensor, Michael Hidalgo and Samantha Groves, Wednesday
20th November at 9.00am - 1.00pm (Sky Lounge, 16th Floor)


3. AppSensor Project presentation, Dennis Groves, Thursday 21st
November at 2.00pm - 3.00pm (Edison Room, 5th Floor)

Dear all

Additional extensive content from Dennis Groves and reviewer feedback
from Graig Munson have been incorporated into the draft new AppSensor
Guide (now currently at v1.36).

The plan is to finalise all content during December and issue it for
more final review late December. Some of you have already offered to
help with that, but if anyone else can contribute, please let me know.
But if you have time before then to review the existing draft content,
please do so anyway.

We have also received some funding from the HOST program (see separate
emails to this list) to design the figures and book layout, as well as
a flyer. The timing of that, and reviewer feedback, may affect when we
release the v2, but we are now aiming for early 2014. I have some more
content to write myself but will do that mid-December.

Note Dennis will seeking review and feedback on the draft book at
Appsec USA next week:

    Writing and Documentation Review Session for documentation
projects including AppSensor, Michael Hidalgo and Samantha Groves,
Wednesday 20th November at 9.00am - 1.00pm (Sky Lounge, 16th Floor)

I'll be around too!

Thanks Dennis

It was just a makeover. We can redo the content a little once the new
book is finalised, and to make sure the project pages reflect the
latest information about code.

So you might be receiving a call about this on one of your quieter days!

If the forms arrive next week, I'll help where I can.

AppSensor Team,

I'd like to create a child project within AppSensor called "Automated
Attack Prevention". This project will be a study of current techniques to
thwart automated attacks against application. The deliverable will be well
documented knowledge and best practices (just like appsensor). The
deliverable could be both stand alone and also as a chapter within the
overall AppSensor book.

This idea is very similar to the defensive nature of AppSensor; however,
the differences of the material and approach warrants it to be slightly
separated as a child project.

Here are a few examples of material we would cover.
- Brute Force Login Protection :
-- Defensive options: Threshold based captcha, IP blocking, Response time
delay
-- Triggers: Can be tied to attacker (IP) or victim (targeted account).
Example: Multiple failed logins from a single IP against any number of
target accounts OR multiple failed logins from multiple IPs against the
same username

- Hashcash concepts and how they might apply in web apps (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash)

- Detection of common web scanner requests and optional response tactics
(drop, ignore, block ip, feed fake response data)

- and more


I think the material is related enough to fly under the AppSensor umbrella,
but different enough to become a child project. Thoughts?

Hello Michael,

Every technique you describe I have implemented commercially using 
statistical methods and AppSensor; and I am working to document it for 
the next handbook.

The main point is that protection time must be greater than detection 
time plus reaction time. So, automated response is the only way to 
really reduce exposure in any measurable way.

Incidentally, this includes the Hashcash which I have never heard of 
before, as a detection point I deemed the 'canary' after canaries in a 
coal mine.

However, that said, I would like to support you creating a child project 
around the automated attack prevention and work with you to further 
flesh out *the future*.

Once you have a data-rich collection of detection points and an 
analytical engine to analyze them whole new worlds of defense open up 
that have yet to be explored.

I do believe it belongs under and would be flattered to have it as part 
of the AppSensor umbrella; I also think that it is not different but the 
very reason why I think that AppSensor is the future of Application 
Security defense.

	* Rich data = rich response.

So my point is: "of course I support you!" and "how do we work together 
to document and demonstrate this next generation of awesomeness?"

Cheers,

Dennis

Sounds like this would be very useful data to have. A canonical list would
give us needed points of reference. Given that the appsensor concept is
less than standardized in industry, the examples could be very helpful.
Cool idea.

I agree that this should be a child project as the existing Detection Points
address automation attacks ? UserTrendException/SystemTrendException.

The differentiation here would be more of a prescriptive/recommendation on
different defensive (Response Actions) for these types of attacks.

Michael ? I would like to assist with this effort as I am currently working
on updating the ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) to version 3.0 where we are
massively re-architecting how our rules are working.  I am taking a more
threat/attack/response view with the CRS so that is clear to users what they
can do under certain attack scenarios.

>From a documentation perspective,  OWASP already has "Attack" Categories
listed here - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Attack.  If you look
at the example page for Brute Force Attack
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Brute_force_attack), it also already lists
"Defensive Tools" at the end.  Perhaps we could modify the applicable attack
categories and expand the "Defensive" details?  Just trying to evaluate what
is out there already if it can be leveraged or updated.  If not, we need to
clearly define why that existing stuff is insufficient and how this new
stuff is different.

My take is that we actually have 3 classes of detection points:

- static: the rules originally defined, these detection points are 
written into the application.
- dynamic: the rules Michael is proposing and I call statistical. These 
detection points 'bake' the threat model directly into the application.
- random: rules that behave as dynamic honey-pots, these detection 
points exist for every input in the application.

I would like us to have strong frameworks defined around all three.
However, this is only half the picture - the other half is response. I 
imagine that there is also three kinds of response as well, they are 
also:

- static: binary responses (e.g. we know this is bad)
- dynamic: this is statistical response, for example a simple dynamic 
rule a scale of 1-10:
	* 1-3: this is unusual but safe behavior so allow & log all further 
requests
	* 2-6: this is normal behavior so do nothing
	* 3-9: this is abnormal bad behavior so deny & log all further requests
	* 10: this is an attack so deny & raise an alert
- random response is a 'self pen-testing application' by using the 
random detection points; and using random responses we can produce a 
full monte-carlo situation where the application has the only knowledge 
about if something is actually vulnerable or not. So either the attack 
is guaranteed to be real or it can be an application produced 'random 
attack.' The application can both test how quickly the humans 'detect 
and respond' as well as 'randomly allow' a real attack in order to 
collect information about the vulnerability only to block it at a later 
point so that a patch can be created from the resulting information 
collected.

Hello All,

One additional thought: when I talk about statistics, I am not talking 
about frequentist inference but bayesian inference.

Michael,

What are the next steps? Second, do we want to consolidate the project 
under git/github there are parts of it in various places around the 
internet?


Cheers,

Dennis

Sounds like we've got agreement. I'd like to launch as a child project at
the following page:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project/AAP

I'll create the same wiki format and then continue using the appsensor
mailing list for discussion.

We can incorporate any and all ideas into the AppSensor book as we see fit.
