Juan Carlos

I am updating the AppSensor Guide v2.0.2 and want to ensure we
properly attribute and point people towards your contributions and
code.

Last year you mentioned work for .Net but also some possible PHP. I'd
like to refer to these in Part IV of the Guide, possibly as part of
Chapter 20 about AppSensor v2, or maybe to replace the existing
chapter 24 which discusses Jni4Net.

My draft Guide document v2.0.12 has been uploaded with track changes on:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appensor-guide-v2.doc

The edits so far include:

- contributors
- grammar and typos
- Timo Goosen's review feedback
- changes as a result of writing the CISO Briefing
- references to the new microsite
- v2 code updates
- additional more recent topic references
- and other comments from these mailing lists over the last year

What do you propose we add for .Net and PHP? Could you provide some
draft text and repository URLs?

Regards

Colin

Hi guys I assume everyone is as busy at work as I am, the mailing list has
been quite quiet.

Here are some interesting links related to Appsensor:

http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/3/8722287/darpa-cyber-grand-challenge-qualification-defcon

There have been lots of suggestions for dashboard ideas for Appsensor. One
of the ideas was to use something similar to the ELK stack or the ELK stack
(Elasticsearch+Kibana+Logstash).
Have a look at what Mozilla is using:

Thanks for these Timo. The Mozilla links are helpful. The DARPA grand
challenge is fascinating. They have another year on that, but I expect some
great new techniques will come out of it.
Thanks,
John

I think ELK would be amazing for Appsensor

In fact one of my side project is to try to feed a number of
detection/monitoring points (from the app I'm working on) to ELK

If you are into docker, here is how simple it is to have it running locally
https://github.com/TeamMentor/TM_Docker/tree/tm-elk (although that is not
the latest version of ELK)

Thanks Dinis. I'll try to see if we can get something going here. Would you
be willing to offer some advice if we have any issues getting started?
Thinking this might be a good project for our new student for the OWASP
summer of code.
Thanks,
John

Have a look at elastalert and watcher. For setting up notifications from
elasticsearch.

Sounds great. I sent the email out to get us started on this for the summer
code sprint. Expect more info in the next couple of weeks.

Hello Laura

John Melton is speaking about AppSensor at AppSec USA on Friday 25th
September at 2pm in Room C. At that we will be handing out some
printed AppSensor materials (paid from AppSensor project funds), and
we need to make an estimate of how many copies to print.

Can you tell us what the maximum seating capacities rooms A, B, C and
D will have, and also any guess of the total estimated conference
delegate numbers?

Regards

Colin Watson

Project list members

So, we have potentially up to 300 attendees for John's talk. I am
wondering how many printed materials to take along to hand out
free-of-sharge at the end. The project still has about ?3,000 for
various promotion activities, and originally most of the reboot money
was intended for book give-aways. I had originally thought to take 200
AppSensor Guides to AppSec USA. The costs from Lulu, excluding
delivery, are:

   $8.50 per copy AppSensor Guide
   $7.60 per copy AppSensor CISO Briefing

There are some further discounts for bulk orders so 200 copies of the
Guide might be about $1,850. Or we could buy 100 of each the Guide and
the CISO Briefing. Or 300 of one.

What do people think?

Regards

Colin

The talk I'm giving will be up against several very good talks (
https://2015.appsecusa.org/agenda/speakers/) and will be at 2pm on Friday
afternoon of the conference. I know in years past lots of folks have left
to try to catch an early flight out on Friday. Hopefully it will be very
well attended, but I'm just not sure about estimation. Does appsecusa track
how many attendees have been at each talk? Maybe we can use data from prior
years to help us estimate.

My gut feeling without data would be to take 100 of each of the guide and
ciso briefing.

Thanks,
John

100 of each sounds like a good idea. Lulu delivers in less than 2
weeks, so we should probably wait until the end of August to order
these.
