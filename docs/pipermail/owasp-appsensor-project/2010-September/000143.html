<PRE>Don,
I actually just recommended the same thing -

</I>&gt;<i> Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was impressed with your talk at the OWASP conference in Irvine.  I talked to you after your presentation.  I mentioned that I have an idea or concept that I would like to see added to the wish list for the AppSensor project.   I don&#8217;t know if this idea is doable, but I thought that I would at least throw it out there and see.  I am not a developer, but I have been working in IT and networking for almost 30 years and see a real need to be able to redirect an incoming session based on triggers.  My first thought was that AppSensor might be the first tool that I have seen that might be able to identify a session, and possibly request the session to be redirected based on a trigger.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have had this idea floating in my head for a while.  What I would like to see is a method to redirect an obvious bad user (an attacker) to another system, such as a honey pot or a system that can handle such an attack, while keeping the session totally transparent from the attacker.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I am thinking is once a set of events are triggered, the AppSensor can initiate or trigger a re-direction of a session to another web server.   This could be as simple as having a load balancer accept a re-direction request (assuming that a load balancer could accept such a request), or something within the application can automatically redirect the session to another web server.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The main purpose to redirect a session is to relive the main web server(s) from the attack.  The secondary benefit would be that there is a set of servers that are focused for this type of abuse and could gather more detailed logging for analysis.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And an obvious third benefit would be that the additional detailed knowledge of the attack could also benefit the AppSensor researchers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I don&#8217;t know how doable this idea of session redirection is, but I thought that I would at least share the idea that I had&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would be curious in what you thought and if this would even be possible?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, thank you for listening&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don Thomas
