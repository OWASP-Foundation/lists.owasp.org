<PRE> Don,

Thanks for your email and I'm glad you enjoyed the talk at Irvine. 
Colin Watson will be hosting an AppSensor talk at AppSec DC. His talk is
focusing on defining an AppSensor implementation strategy. It should be
really good. Make sure to stop by if you happen to be at that event :)

Regarding your idea, this is definitely plausible. I think this best
fits as a configurable response action. Just like an application may
configure AppSensor to logout the user or lock the account, they could
also configure AppSensor to redirect the user to a honeypot.  Depending
upon the honeypot and network setup this could completely invisible to
the attacker.

Now, how can we best integrate this idea into AppSensor?  AppSensor is
broken down into two main components - AppSensor the idea and AppSensor
code that is ready to use.  The AppSensor idea is our knowledge base.
This is where we include all the great ideas we have and encourage
people to leverage this knowledge in their custom deployments. This
includes all of the various detection points and different response
actions.  The AppSensor code is our efforts to create quality code
(thanks John!) that can be easily used to quickly add an AppSensor
capability into an application.

The first step for any new AppSensor concept is to define it within the
&quot;AppSensor Idea&quot; portion of the project.  I would recommend reviewing
the current response actions wiki page (great work Colin!) that is
listed here: <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_ResponseActions">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_ResponseActions</A> 
Figure out where your idea should go and then add it to the wiki.  You
can also bounce your write-up/ideas off of Colin and Ryan to get their
feedback too.

Would you be willing to take the lead on that idea and get it added into
the wiki?  Let me know if you need wiki login credentials. I can help
with that.


Thanks!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have had this idea floating in my head for a while. What I would like to see

</I>&gt;<i> such as a honey pot or a system that can handle such an attack, while keeping 
</I>&gt;<i> the session totally transparent from the attacker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I am thinking is once a set of events are triggered, the AppSensor can 
</I>&gt;<i> initiate or trigger a re-direction of a session to another web server. This 
</I>&gt;<i> could be as simple as having a load balancer accept a re-direction request 
</I>&gt;<i> (assuming that a load balancer could accept such a request), or something within 
</I>&gt;<i> the application can automatically redirect the session to another web server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main purpose to redirect a session is to relive the main web server(s) from 
</I>&gt;<i> the attack. The secondary benefit would be that there is a set of servers that 
</I>&gt;<i> are focused for this type of abuse and could gather more detailed logging for 
</I>&gt;<i> analysis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And an obvious third benefit would be that the additional detailed knowledge of 
</I>&gt;<i> the attack could also benefit the AppSensor researchers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I don&#8217;t know how doable this idea of session redirection is, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> thought that I would at least share the idea that I had&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would be curious in what you thought and if this would even be possible?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, thank you for listening&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
