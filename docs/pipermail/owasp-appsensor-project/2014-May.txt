Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Some hacking for the weekend (with an
	AppSensor and O2 Platform flavour)
Message-ID: <CA+f=kXCzda-M1RcbZXMVhm_BJR_z+aJ=+FSb8NpX_fXyf9-Ygw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi AppSensor list

I sent the email below to the OWASP leaders list. Since all of you are
interested in AppSensor and security, here is a copy for the ones who
didn't received it.

---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
----------

As you can see on Please hack TeamMentor 3.4.1 (learn, maybe be paid or
even get a job)<http://blog.diniscruz.com/2014/05/please-hack-teammentor-341-learn-maybe.html>
I'm
inviting the world to hack the app I'm been working for the past years.

You can either do a pure black-box (on
https://tm-appsensor.azurewebsites.net ) or look at the source code (clone
from https://github.com/TeamMentor/Dev and run locally or in Azure (only
needs .NET 4.0, no DB install required)

There is quite a lot of OWASP influence in this release of TeamMentor, from
the O2 Platform FluentSharp libraries (which make me a lot more productive
as a developer), to the AppSensor-like features (see below) and the
multiple OWASP-inspired coding strategies used to keep the app secure (look
for example at the ASMX and WCF security tests or the .NET Security
Demands).

What is really cool and I'm very excited about, is the first pass at adding
AppSensor capabilities to this app.

Like I mentioned many times when talking about AppSensor, my main issue
with the original model was that it pushed apps to add too much behaviour
to the application in order be 'Appsensor-ready' (which could affect the
application's performance/behaviour).  My preferred approach (which I've
implemented now) is to first really improve the ability of an application
to 'report and visualise' what is going on. This is done by pushing that
info to 'somewhere' outside the app, then start thinking about how to
detect malicious activity (from the point of view of that app) and finally
what should be done about it.

For the real-time data distribution (user activities, debug logs and
request urls) I used Firebase mapped to an AngularJS UI, which really rocks
(the firebase 'websockets content push' fells like magic). You can read
most details about it in the 7 posts at
http://blog.diniscruz.com/search/label/Firebase and if you want to see it
action, create an account and let me know (i'll give you admin access to
that Azure box if you promise to behave :)  )

So have a go, and please share that blog post (and the server details) to
others who you think might be interested (note that the last guy who
reported a bunch of security issues with TM got a job out of it).

The other area that I'm really interested in, is to have a couple threads
on important security topics like: Data Encoding, Authentication,
Authorisation, OWASP Top 10 issues, Application self-defence, Unit-Test
driven development (with a security focus), Continuous
Integration/Deployment (with security embedded in it) and
static-code/dynamic analysis of multi-tear webservices+jquery based apps
like this.

Those are all things I worry daily, and as you can see, SI (Security
Innovation) is pretty good sport at having this type of open discussion
about their product (which has its code available in a public GitHub
repository (it's not Open Source, but at least the code is all there)).

A lot of the times we (the appsec guys/gals) are accused of talking in
vacuum or providing security guidance on demo/simple apps. OK, here is a
real-world app, with real-world complexity and compromises. Ideally OWASP
should be able to help developers like me and protect these apps users.

I know that sometimes it feels that OWASP is stuck and doesn't really
connect with developers, but I have to say that as a developer I benefit
tremendously from the knowledge shared by OWASP (for example the
cheat-sheets), its projects (for example AppSensor or ESAPI (from which I
took the 'concepts' not the code)) and chapters/conferences.

Thanks

Dinis

Dinis,
Very cool - thanks for sharing. This will help shape some of the ideas
going into V2. Very nice work.

Thanks,

At the moment here are the user activity logs that we track:

*For users with account (or logged in)*

Access Denied , Account Expired , Edit Article (Notepad) , Login Fail , New
User , Open TBot Page , Open TeamMentor , Password Change , PasswordReset
Requested , SessionId Not Accepted , Update Article , User Disabled , User
Login , User Logout , User Password Change , User Search , User Updated ,
View Article (direct) , View Article Html


*For anonymous users *

Open TeamMentor , 404, Application Error, Login Fail


Note that we don't do any behaviour analysis or reaction inside TM's
engine. We just push the data out in realtime, which is then visualised in
a number of different ways (I need to write a couple blog posts on that, or
if you want I can give you access to see it)

One of the next steps that I would like to follow, is to map these
activities into the multiple AppSensor detection points, and start
thinking/implementing the logic that detects malicious activity.

I would like to do this outside the main TM codebase, so that this can be a
generic module that could be used on other apps.

Btw, now that I'm starting to have data to look at, it is quite interesting
how blind spots are easier to spot. For example, although we capture User
Edits (and who did it), I just noticed that we don't capture 'user account
status changes' for example when an Editor becomes and Admin (which could
be an example of an CSRF attack). This is an example of an activity (or
detection point) that requires code changes (and QA testing) since the
logic to know if an user status changed, is quite deep into TM's code.

Good day!
 
I am looking for an expanded explanation for item https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_DetectionPoints#CIE4:_Carriage_Return_or_Line_Feed_Character_in_File_Request
 
Specifically, POST bodies which would trigger such a detection point; examples would be appreciated.
 
Cheers,
Mario at superconfigure.com

Sounds awesome. Would be good to have a look at some of the amazing work
Colin's done on planning for adding appsensor to an application
(architecture). It sounds remarkably similar to what you have above.
Capturing the data is a significant first step. Hopefully the reference
implementation will be in a place where you can use it once you need the
analysis engine component. That way, you just issue a REST request from TM
to an "engine" and either poll for responses or get them via websockets if
you like.

Thanks,
John

(cross posted to the AppSensor project and AppSensor development mailing lists)

The v2.0 release of the AppSensor Guide has been published. OWASP
AppSensor is free to use and it is licensed under the Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license. The guide is available free of
charge at:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appensor-guide-v2.doc

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appsensor-guide-v2.pdf

The black & white book is also available to order at cost in hard copy
from Lulu:

   http://www.lulu.com/shop/owasp-foundation/appsensor-guide/paperback/product-21608107.html

The new guide was conceived at AppSensor Summit held during AppSec USA
2011 in Minneapolis. Although it has taken some time to produce
something comprehensive, we have also managed to include very recent
ideas and developments.

This has all been entirely achieved through unpaid voluntary efforts.
Unfortunately the previously announced HOST grant for professional
design for the book and a flyer never materialised. But we do have a
little OWASP Reboot project funding to help with promotion.

Please join me in thanking co-authors Dennis Groves and John Melton,
and the other contributors, editors and reviewers, Ryan Barnett,
Michael Coates, Craig Munson and Jay Reynolds. The growth and
increased maturity of the project as a whole would not have been
possible without the other people, many on this mailing list, who
contributed project feedback, suggestions and ideas. I have attempted
to name everyone I am aware of in the book's acknowledgements.

I hope you and others will be able to gain further inspiration from
this new guide, and perhaps contribute to an even better next version.

If you do find the guide useful, please consider rating and reviewing
it on Lulu.

If you are able to translate the book into another language, that
would be even more helpful.

Thank you,

Colin Watson

All,

Just a brief note that I am going to start using the -dev mailing list (
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-appsensor-dev) for code-related
updates. If you want to see those, subscribe to that list. I don't want to
pollute this list for folks who aren't interested in the code / reference
implementation.

I just posted a message tonight if anyone is interested and isn't yet
subscribed to -dev
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-appsensor-dev/2014-May/000040.html


Thanks,
John

Deborah and Joshua

Further to your emails last year regarding the HOST Investment Award,
I wanted to provide an update. We have successfully finished and
published the new version of the OWASP AppSensor Guide v2.0 - it is
available free of charge at:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appensor-guide-v2.doc

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appsensor-guide-v2.pdf

Also at cost in print from Lulu.com:

   http://www.lulu.com/shop/owasp-foundation/appsensor-guide/paperback/product-21608107.html

Since the HOST funding did not materialise in time (by end April
2014), we did not have any funds to spend on the proposal's funding
request for:

- Professional design for the in? progress book.
- Professional design of a new flyer leaflet promoting the project and book.
- The printing of the flyer.

But we got the book out in any case, in a completely unfunded and voluntary way.

We thank you for your interest in our work.

Regards

In reference to:
 OWASP AppSensor Project

Dear Samantha,

After some considerable discussion it has been determined that the
2013 project awardees should be treated as HOST program subcontractors
under the HOST prime contractor, Georgia Institute Technology Research
Institute. The next step to become a subcontractor is to work directly
with program manager / principal investigator Joshua Davis, copied
here. You should expect to hear from Josh this week (by Friday
November 14th). Then by no later than Monday November 17th you should
expect to receive full instructions and any requisite form to move
forward on becoming an official subcontractor. A contract including
the Statement of Work we recently worked with you to complete will be
included in the final contract.

Although this is more process than anticipated by GTRI earlier this
year, it may be encouraging to know that it will only need to be done
one time should you in the future receive any additional award.

Thanks again for your cooperation and patience. We look forward to
working with you in the coming weeks.

Best Regards,




Deborah Bryant
Principal Consultant Bryant Group and
Investments Lead, Homeland Open Security Technology Program

Joshua

Thank you for the kind words.

I will leave it up to the other co-leaders to decide about another use
for the funding if it is still available, but I think they are still
interested in producing a slicker-looking version. Maybe v2.1 or v3.0
- I have "run out of ink" for the moment, and am just doing some admin
things to tidy loose ends up.

Best regards to you all,

Colin
