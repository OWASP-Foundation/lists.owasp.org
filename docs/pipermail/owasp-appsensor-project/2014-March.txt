All,

Wanted to get the community opinion on something I've been thinking about
recently. What does everyone think about having a separate website for
appsensor? I know we have the standard page (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor), which has improved greatly in
both form and function, but wondering if others felt a standalone website
would be useful.

I ran across the OpenSAMM website (http://www.opensamm.org/) tonight and
compared it to the OWASP OpenSAMM project page (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Software_Assurance_Maturity_Model).
I thought the standalone website had some useful differences.

There seems to be advantages to having both. In particular, I started
thinking about this when thinking about building out user documentation for
the v2 code project, which I think could benefit from a standalone site
simply for visualization and flow compared to the wiki.

Not sold on this idea, just looking for general feedback.

Thanks,
John

It is nice idea.

I think if we can put some blog (with posts from team as well as users) and
standalone site together, then it will be more useful.

I feel like we are missing Appsensor evangelism (Though some of the team
members participating in some events, (unless I miss something) there are
very few public examples available on internet on how people using
Appsensor in action).

Thank you,
Giri

I think having a standalone site, and the project wiki, would be a good
idea. I believe Open SAMM website is Wordpress based, but is/was moving to
Wordpress hosted on OWASP systems. Might be worth asking Matt Tesauro about
what's possible?

Gentlemen,

I am very grateful you moved to the new template and are considering a 
stand-alone website.

But this really concerns me.

https://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/list

No update to AppSensor since 2012.

Are there ways we can focus on getting updates and additions to the 
project itself rolling again?

Aloha,
Jim

The majority of the efforts are focused on the book - the primary
deliverable of the project. A second version with major changes coming
soon. The code is proof of concept. I don't have any code changes planned,
maybe others do?

JavaDoc? Better unit testing? More examples? Framework support? Solve 
the one enhancement request that was made in 2011? 
https://code.google.com/p/appsensor/issues/detail?id=8

One of the main attributes of a OSS project is activity and maintenance. 
It's strange for me to see so much work on the window dressing instead 
of the code itself.

This is just a polite note, I could be off base, the call is yours.

Aloha,

Completely fair points - see https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor

Note: the reason I asked about the separate website in the first place was
for the documentation of the new version v2 of the code. However, want to
make sure I'm doing things "the OWASP way" - just hoping to give the best
UX I can.

The code for the project is being completely redone for v2 so that it can
work not only in "local" mode, but also in client-server style mode (many
client applications instrumented with detection points sending events to a
central server that analyses them and informs clients of appropriate
responses to take). This enables us to support much more than just Java.
Also, the dependency on ESAPI is completely removed. I have some code to
push probably tonight that will put the new code in a place where the
initial base features are all there and we'll have a couple trivial sample
reporting apps. From here on out, it'll be adding new components.

I've had several conversations about the next version of the code on the
mailing lists (spanning a couple years b/c it took a while for me to get
going :>).

If anybody has thoughts or ideas, send them my way, and I'll try to get
them added, or feel free to add issues to github. I'll also try to close
out that final issue in google code so it points to v2 of the code. v1 was
honestly mostly a POC or alpha project at best (the code, not the book).


Thanks,
John

Matt,
Any thoughts about the below? Tl;dr considering a standalone site for the
AppSensor project in addition to the wiki.
Questions:
Is this recommended? (I saw opensamm.org and thought it was a good idea)
Is this hosted by OWASP?
If hosted by OWASP, what platform(s) are available? WP, static sites, other?

Colin mentioned we might check with you for finding out what's possible.
Any info you have would be great. Alternatively, if there's someone else we
should ask, just let me know.

Thanks,
John

Cool. Your github link is not the project website as far as I can see

== Quick Download ==

* OWASP AppSensor Guide v1.1 EN (beta)
** [https://www.owasp.org/images/2/2f/OWASP_AppSensor_Beta_1.1.pdf PDF]
** [https://www.owasp.org/images/b/b0/OWASP_AppSensor_Beta_1.1.doc DOC]
* OWASP AppSensor Demonstration Implementations
** [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_Developer_Guide Developer 
Guide]
** [http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/ Code]

Just a suggestion: consider adding your github link and possibly your 
future plans to the wiki in some way. Adding visibility to open source 
work build trust! :)

Aloha,
- Jim

You're absolutely correct. My plan was to get the initial code cut done
then update the docs but I should probably update now.

Hello Jim,

Actually, we have volunteers at work on additional frameworks.  However, we
like all projects are volunteer - Jim, as you have a large social network
do you know anybody who would be willing to work with us on some of the
suggestions you have?

I myself am the reason the book is behind schedule, I have been working in
Qatar, and have not had any spare cycles to devote to it - however, things
are returning to a balance that allows me to contribute again. Lets speak
about this face-to-face in Japan.

Cheers,

Dennis

I am happy to help find your more volunteers. There is no rush, I'm only 
suggesting you put the github link and roadmap on the site. Activity in 
the code of your project provides trust. Seeing no code changes for two 
years does the opposite!

My 2 cents.

Aloha,
Jim

John,

I love AppSensor and see its value or I would not be hassling you all.

The more visibility you shine on your good work the better, even if 
incomplete. First of all, its encourages others to jump in and add 
support. Second, it adds a lot of trust that folks can and should use 
this project.

Looks like you are very active, that is awesome. Put it out there! :)

Aloha,
Jim

Thanks for the encouragement!

Looks like you are very active, that is awesome. Put it out there!


May I suggest you project troll ASVS instead?

Colin ;-)

Trolling involves sarcasm and other things trying to promote negativity. 
I am sorry you see my comments as trollin' but with respect I think they 
are very legit concerns about how *developers* perceive this project.

I heard a few things in this thread:

1) It's done with no changes planned
2) A new version is being worked in (in secret)
3) Roadmap plans are not published (more secrets)
4) A book is underway

And when I went to look at the code via the link published on the wiki 
project page, it's been untouched for two years. So a lot of analysts 
and other folks have written very highly about the project. It's funded. 
The wiki is mostly updated. This is all fantastic. But when a dev in the 
know looks at the codebase and sees no activity for years, it's a really 
bad sign.

I am thrilled to hear there is work being done. My advice is to shine 
light on that.

Regards,
- Jim

I was using sarcasm too, and you are quite right to ask these questions,
raise developer concerns and seek greater transparency.

We will strive to improve.

Dear all

Further details on DHS HOST Award funding for design has not been
forthcoming, therefore we will proceed without that. As mentioned before,
the draft book continues to be maintained here:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appensor-guide-v2.doc

I plan to finish my own work on the book by 17th April. If I receive any
contributions, edits and other additions by then, they will be incorporated
into the draft for review.

If you are able to review between the 18th and 30th April, please be ready.
The review period will end on 1st May.

We will then publish the v2.0 book on 7th May 2014. This will be as a PDF,
in Word and also as a Lulu book.

Further additions and improvements can be made after that in future
versions.

Colin

Awesome work Colin (and team). I'll plan to review during those 2 weeks.

As a related question, how does the errata for books like this work? Do you
just update them directly? Does that work in Lulu? Or do you produce new
versions?

Hi Colin,

How do we submit edits? Is there any template (or) any other mechanism?

Thank you,
Giri

Chetan,
Replying to this on list since Colin had asked for an example json snippet
at one point. A sample JSON string for adding a new event is below.

{"user":{"username":"SOME_END_USERNAME"},"detectionPoint":{"id":"SOME_DETECTION_POINT_ID"},"timestamp":
SOME_UNIX_TIMESTAMP }

The only additional point to note is that you have to make the request with
an http request header. The default key for that header is
'X-Appsensor-Client-Application-Name'
and the value would be the name of the client application being used.

For further info check the addRecord method at
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/blob/master/sample-apps/simple-dashboard/src/main/webapp/index.jsp.
Thanks,
John

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] appsensor v2 code
Message-ID: <CAM8z=yJrzvodxALtWDQfRDmizAed+ai1+wu92Km-ZZVboUD-PQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I've been plugging away on v2 of the code for a bit now, and am asking for
help at this point. Link to v2 of the code:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor

The code has been fully rewritten. The main reason for the rewrite was to
allow a client-server style model as opposed to requiring appsensor be
fully embedded in the application. You can now have a central server
collecting events from multiple applications and performing analysis. These
front-end applications can be in any language as long as they speak
rest/soap. There's been a host of other changes, but this was the primary
one.

I've lined up a bunch of starter ideas below, but if you want to work on
ANYTHING, please let me know.

--------
CODING
- analysis engine - different versions could be built, ie stochastic vs.
statistical vs. behavioral, etc. (written in java)
- web services - currently working on these, but need handlers for
rest/soap in the backend (java)
- implementations of core storage components - current implementations are
in-memory, but we'll want file-backed, database-backed (sql/nosql), etc.
implementations (java)
- unit tests / integration tests for the analysis engine (java)
- sample detection point implementations (any language)
- sample client applications / demos using appsensor (any language)
- reporting services apis (java)
- reporting client UI - need a reference front-end to visualize and manage
the data (any language, but should be web-based) - see also UX below

UX
- It would be awesome to provide a default UI for event visualization and
management. This could be a big, fun project.

DOCUMENTATION
- configuration scripts / tutorials for different web / application
servers. We need to show how to setup the authentication for client
applications since that will be done by the web/app servers and not the
analysis engine itself. Essentially, this is setup and documentation of
reverse proxy configuration. We can lean heavily on web server
documentation here. (documentation / scripting)
- end-user documentation guidance (documentation)
--------

Thanks,
John

Hi John, what do you think of using Firebase as a way to feed data into the
AppSensor analysis/reporting engine?

Dinis,

I've not used firebase before. Briefly looked online. Seems like it could
be used, but more likely in reporting. The backend needs to do some
analysis, and it looked to me like firebase was just for storage and
distribution of data. It could be useful to write responses to, and have
those pushed to all your different desired clients though. I probably will
not write a handler for it myself immediately since it's a paid-for service
(though it has a free tier). If somebody else wants to jump in, it could
certainly be useful.

Thanks,
John

It's currently a Word document, which I can produce a PDF from for Lulu. So
for now, it's do editing in Word. After we get done, I think Denis had some
thoughts on converting into a format that we can collaborate on more easily
and also generate other formats from.

Either:

1. Send edit extracts and instructions by email (as text or in any other
format you prefer)
2. Edit the Word document with track changes on and email it to me

I will them merge all the changes.

I have updated the road map on the project wiki:


https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project#Road_Map_and_Getting_Involved

I was a bit vague about when v2 would be "finished". But that's fine we can
add the request for assistance into the v2 book.

The current draft is still in the same public place on the wiki.

- Will this preserve the layout for Lulu (the current Word doc is designed
for easy conversion into a printable book)

- Does Google docs support the embedded/linked endnotes, custom page
headers, cross-referencing links and the existing tables and embedded
diagrams?

Or were you thinking the edits would be done on Google Docs, and then I
would merge them back into a master Word document?

Colin,

My thinking was that we would increase the speed and ease of book writing
by having a single online reference point where we could all edit, comment,
or add (for authors) in real time. This would eliminate the need for
merging in changes and feedback from authors or comments.

However, you raise a good point in your email. Simply transitioning the
document may be require a bit of effort and this may not be warranted if we
can use the current system over the next few weeks. I like that everything
is clearly laid out here -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project#tab=Road_Map_and_Getting_Involved.


As long as people can continue to grab the copy listed at the url and send
comments directly to colin (or the mailing list) then we should be ok. The
google doc approach would be an item to consider if in the future we start
having version conflicts or trouble keeping up with merging and
distributing updated versions to a variety of editors.

So, consider my original email just an idea for the future! I'll read
through the word doc and track changes. Then I'll send over the doc to you
(colin) for review and merge into the master doc.

Sound good?

Thanks!
Michael

I'm writing a book myself. We use google docs for the entire process - up
until the point where we submit our final version to our editor. From there
we use word for the final formatting process. To Colins point, formatting
in word is excellent, but collaboration is better in Google Docs. So use
both!

Colin,

My thinking was that we would increase the speed and ease of book writing
by having a single online reference point where we could all edit, comment,
or add (for authors) in real time. This would eliminate the need for
merging in changes and feedback from authors or comments.

However, you raise a good point in your email. Simply transitioning the
document may be require a bit of effort and this may not be warranted if we
can use the current system over the next few weeks. I like that everything
is clearly laid out here -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project#tab=Road_Map_and_Getting_Involved.


As long as people can continue to grab the copy listed at the url and send
comments directly to colin (or the mailing list) then we should be ok. The
google doc approach would be an item to consider if in the future we start
having version conflicts or trouble keeping up with merging and
distributing updated versions to a variety of editors.

So, consider my original email just an idea for the future! I'll read
through the word doc and track changes. Then I'll send over the doc to you
(colin) for review and merge into the master doc.

Sound good?

Thanks!
Michael

Thank you all.

I will try to get the book onto Google Docs as well, but if anyone
else wants to do it in the meantime, please do so,

Dennis

The latest version is on the wiki, as usual:

   v1.36
   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Owasp-appensor-guide-v2.doc
I don't have your new intro text, so that could be added to begin with.


However it is done, please ensure all changes are identifiable so I
can them pull them down into the Word document again.

Colin

I have started to use GitHub+DropBox+LeanPub to write a couple books , and
am quite happy with the result/workflow so far

For example this book:
https://leanpub.com/Practical_Git

Has the content here:
https://github.com/DinisCruz/Book_Practical_Git

Is discussed here:
https://github.com/DinisCruz/Book_Practical_Git/issues/3

Was fixed (by a contributor) here:
https://github.com/DinisCruz/Book_Practical_Git/pull/4

More details here:

Hi John

Thanks for the event JSON. I am writing things for the Guide v2. Would
you have an example JSON request with that all populated including the
HTTP headers?

If the applications is running on multiple hosts, would it be better
to include the host identity in the
'X-Appsensor-Client-Application-Name' header as well?

   X-Appsensor-Client-Application-Name: WidgetCo-Web05

Or should we encourage a separate optional header for host?

And do you have the same for attacks and responses, which I think are
the other exposed services (having had a snoop around the code)?

I have forgotten, but are we (you) doing any form of identity
authentication or message integrity checking at this stage?Just so
that I can allude to such stuff in my draft text.

Colin

John et al

On the topic of events and JSON.... would it be useful if the
detection point ID were unique per application/host? I am just trying
to write up what someone might do if they sent events somewhere else
using Common Event Format.

A centralised system might want to know that RE4 on the corporate
website is different to RE4 on the customer extranet or RE4 on the
supplier extranet.  Not sure if it matters too much in the
demonstration implementation, but might be nice not to rule it out?
And in my experience some applications have multiple instances of
detection point types (RE1, RE2, RE3, IE4 etc). I don't want to
complicate anything too much though.

  "SOME_HOST_ID"-"SOME_APP_ID"-"SOME_APP_VERSION"-"SOME_DETECTION_POINT_TYPE"-"SOME_DP_ID"

e.g. WS03-CUSTEXTRANET-3.02-RE3-002

Maybe this is already possible with AppSensor WS - just a longer
string for the "SOME_DETECTION_POINT_ID"?

Colin,
I haven't collected the full POST request, but the only header we care
about is the one you specified ('X-Appsensor-Client-Application-Name' is
the default, but you can change this via configuration).

As for the multiple hosts question, I am simply assuming that application
is the level of granularity you care about. The system is flexible enough
to support multiple hosts, but you would handle it using application name
suffixing as you mentioned above. The only thing you'd want to do there is
ensure that you add all your hosts for a given application to a correlation
set so that end users are considered the same across "client applications",
in this case hosts of a single client application.

Regarding attacks and responses ... I don't have the JSON handy (in the
middle of a machine rebuild), but ...
- The request for attacks would look the same, except to '/attacks'
- The request for responses would be a 'GET' request to
'/responses?earliest=12345' where the query parameter 'earliest' is a unix
timestamp that represents the "start time" to retrieve responses from. If
you sent a timestamp of 5 minutes ago, you would get the responses created
in the last 5 minutes. It's a simple polling mechanism and the client will
simply update that timestamp after every successful call. That way they
only pull the responses they haven't retrieved yet.

We are not doing identity authentication or message integrity checking. The
basic assumption I'm working from at this point (after talking with Kevin
Wall a good bit on this topic) is that we'll just rely on web servers to do
authentication, then pass the client name header through and then we'll do
authorization. By using the reverse proxy setup, we save ourselves a good
bit of effort and give users a lot of deployment flexibility.

Thanks,
John

Colin,
You have great (and very complicating) thoughts :>.

I think I would throw this into the meta-reporting bucket since the
detection point policy is configured on the analysis engine.

In local mode, this makes no difference. However, consider your web
services setup. Let's say we have 5 client applications all configured to
send data to a single analysis engine. When the client application detects
an event, it will notify the analysis engine of the detection point id, not
the policy. So, the analysis engine needs to lookup the policy for a given
detection point id.
- If you have distinct detection point ids (ie. a naming convention setup
by the user as you mentioned above), no problem.
- If you mean supporting different policies for the same detection point id
on different applications, I would just recommend using 2 different
analysis engines, then have a reporting interface that prefixes the client
application to the detection point for presentation.

Thanks,
John

I'm following this Twitter account that was just created just to see
what it's doing:

    https://twitter.com/appsensor

Did anyone at OWASP or on this list set it up, or is it about to turn
into something malicious?

That's fine, noted.

That's a really important thought, and I have added it into the draft
guide in the section we have about architecture.

No worries / good luck.

Thanks. I have added some notes about this in the short write-up about
AppSensor WS. It's just draft text, so can be corrected later.

Noted, and I have added some wording around that to the guide.

I think this is what I meant yes. So as long as the IDs are unique,
AppSensor WS doesn't care.  I've added some text about ID uniqueness
to the guide.

"WEB05-WEBSHOP-IE1-1012"

I created it. Thought it would be nice to have an account we could
broadcast updates from.

Just wanted to check it wasn't a fake account!

Message-ID: <CAJcRqZgM7ADXHMJAs41PC9yqoX8gJBzw-7+uD7kQf7KasbkCsg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi John,

1. If I want to contribute to *Event Analysis engine (EVA)*, where
must I start from?

2. What is the current execution progress state of *Event analysis
engine*? If there is any current research going-on how to join the
club?

3. After going through *Owasp-Appsensor-guide-v2.doc*, I've understood
that an Event analysis engine will analyse events and
respond accordingly. But, I couldn't find clear specifications that
states the complete *requirements for the EVA*.
If there is one please help me to locate. Orelse could you specify
what will be the requirements for EVA?

Thanks,

Monish


>* All,
*>>* I've been plugging away on v2 of the code for a bit now, and am asking for
*>* help at this point. Link to v2 of the code:
*>* https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor
<https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor>
*>>* The code has been fully rewritten. The main reason for the rewrite was to
*>* allow a client-server style model as opposed to requiring appsensor be
*>* fully embedded in the application. You can now have a central server
*>* collecting events from multiple applications and performing analysis. These
*>* front-end applications can be in any language as long as they speak
*>* rest/soap. There's been a host of other changes, but this was the primary
*>* one.
*>>* I've lined up a bunch of starter ideas below, but if you want to work on
*>* ANYTHING, please let me know.
*>>* --------
*>* CODING
*>* - analysis engine - different versions could be built, ie stochastic vs.
*>* statistical vs. behavioral, etc. (written in java)
*>* - web services - currently working on these, but need handlers for
*>* rest/soap in the backend (java)
*>* - implementations of core storage components - current implementations are
*>* in-memory, but we'll want file-backed, database-backed (sql/nosql), etc.
*>* implementations (java)
*>* - unit tests / integration tests for the analysis engine (java)
*>* - sample detection point implementations (any language)
*>* - sample client applications / demos using appsensor (any language)
*>* - reporting services apis (java)
*>* - reporting client UI - need a reference front-end to visualize and
*>* manage the data (any language, but should be web-based) - see also UX below
*>>* UX
*>* - It would be awesome to provide a default UI for event visualization and
*>* management. This could be a big, fun project.
*>>* DOCUMENTATION
*>* - configuration scripts / tutorials for different web / application
*>* servers. We need to show how to setup the authentication for client
*>* applications since that will be done by the web/app servers and not the
*>* analysis engine itself. Essentially, this is setup and documentation of
*>* reverse proxy configuration. We can lean heavily on web server
*>* documentation here. (documentation / scripting)
*>* - end-user documentation guidance (documentation)
