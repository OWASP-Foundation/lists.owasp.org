Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] New website!
Message-ID: <CAM8z=y+nVTOwar_JMgkrWG9nMT0VHbXPP078LZoq1BHLv1H-pg@mail.gmail.com>

All,

We have a new website!  Please check out http://appsensor.org/

This new website is meant to do a few things:

- Explain the high level concept in a simple way and point people back
to the project site and the book for more detail

- Give developers a nice entry point to the project - modelled after
other framework/library sites

- Give us more flexibility in how we present the project (not just wiki format)

- In the future, hoping to have live demo's

Please give any and all feedback, and many thanks to those who helped out.

Thanks,
John

I also like this because I have an entire publishing workflow that uses
markdown, so I will start moving the current 'book' to markdown and github.

Message-ID: <CAM8z=yKG4z1QL5J5H-AA53xwtmQVuUisioutCQes8-_7kBgKgQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I'm happy to announce that the beta release of version 2.0.0 has just
been published.

The website (http://appsensor.org) has been updated with appropriate
documentation, and the release information is published here:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta

If you happen to be at AppSecUSA next week, please feel free to share
this info freely. I'm targeting Oct/Nov for the 2.0.0 final release,
so getting feedback now would be helpful to flesh out any major
issues.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
John

Great work - I plugged the hell out of it on some high profile security

This is brilliant. I just read it all through, and I think it's really
clear. I am sure it will help some of those "what is this AppSensor
thing" enquiries that we didn't address very well via the wiki.

I will work through the Getting Started and User Guide sections, and
try it step-by-step.

I have updated the news section on the wiki, and also added references
to the new website and a banner link and the main tab:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=OWASP_AppSensor_Project

Also added a larger website screenshot and link to the media tab:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project#tab=Media

Also updated the code notes on:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=OWASP_AppSensor_Project&action=submit#tab=Road_Map_and_Getting_Involved

You seem to have been quite busy :-)

This is great news. How do you want to receive any feedback?

My first complaint is we are going to have to update the Guide in
October/November ;-)

I was inspired to get something done after looking at the quality of the book!

As for feedback:
- if it's code-related (bugs, feature requests, etc.) feel free to use
the issue tracker (https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/issues), or
email me directly if you'd rather, and I'll create and track the
issues.
- if it's documentation-related, probably emailing me is the better
route. I'll get it fixed up. The code for the site is actually in
github (https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/tree/master/appsensor-dot-org),
so you could make changes and do a pull-request if you like, but
emailing me (on or off list) is fine as well.

As for updating the guide, I'm happy to take the lion-share of the
work there. If you can point me to what sections you think should be
updated, I can do the leg work. Just let me know.

Thanks,
John

Juan,

That's true - this is big news that I failed to share publicly and
certainly brings appsensor to a larger base of users/developers. Since you
and your team put in the effort, can you give us a quick description of
what you did for the benefit of the list? I'll follow up with a few notes
after you do that.

Thanks,
John

That seems to be a piece I missed from the Guide, and will need to
reference it in the next update.

Thanks Juan!

This is a really big win for us. Language interoperability was one of the 2
major design goals of v2 (along with client/server deployment). The work
Juan and team have done shows this is possible - big kudos there.

There has been a lot of work done in the last couple years around api code
generation, so I'm hoping to look into that as a way to support different
languages in a minimal way. However, real power will come with the ideas
Juan put forth about framework integrations. Having a module that handles
responses in a .NET specific way is a huge win to developers wanting to
implement appsensor. It means they can just get started. I think this will
be a huge area of possibility for us going forward. I think what the
netflix folks have done with ensnare (
https://github.com/ahoernecke/ensnare/wiki) is really remarkable. They
plugged into rails directly and got huge benefits. The base of the
appsensor mechanism is there now. Taking it to frameworks directly
(something owasp talks about all the time) would make it so much easier for
devs. This is what Juan and team are doing and I think it's awesome and the
path we should head towards.

Also, the dev list is cc'ed already.

Thanks,
John

All,

As promised, I put together a tentative roadmap for the next year or
so for appsensor development. It's definitely in outline form, but I
think that's all we have/need right now.

Have a look and let me know your thoughts - things to
add/remove/delay/speed up, etc.

The section I'm referring to is called "Proposed Code Roadmap (IN
REVIEW)" on the following page

Looks great to me. I'll add a brief note for the documentation roadmap
to keep it updated with changes in the code, and for new ideas that
come along as that  develops.

Here are some comments on the book (Appsensor guide v2):

Hi I got your email from John Melton. I'm helping to review the
documentation for app sensor and
I'm planning on helping to put together some developer documentation.

Here are some of my comments on the book.

Regards.
Timo

- ------------------------------------

AppSensor V2 Book: Review:
- -------------------

Page 55:

"Mobile technicians connect to smart meters using an infrared optical
port which is
more reliable in the many different locations that the meters can be
installed in
"
More reliable than what? And also more reliable in what way?

"The long, highly random, security codes could be identified by
brute force and dictionary attacks."
I'm not sure what this means? Are you saying that if someone attempted
to guess the
long and highly random passwords that it would be possible if they did
so over a long period of time using a brute force attack?

Just btw, this example of people trying to hack smart power meters is a
very relevant one. This happens all the time
and people find very creative ways to bypass the built in mechanisms to
prevent people from trying to hack them. Especially
in my country (South Africa) this is something that people like to do
and get away with.
Maybe an example to add
is to detect if someone is just completely bypassing the meter but
keeping some electricity connected to the meter just so the meter won't
notice
that it is being bypassed.  People also often like to put these meters
in metal containers to stop any mobile signal from notifying the meter
vendor that the meter is being tampered with.(think of this as a
Faraday cage, similar technique is used in South Africa when stealing
cars with tracking devices).

- -----------------------
Page 90:

"Remember, AppSensor is concerned with identifying and stopping attacks
against unknown vulnerabilities such as:...Zero day vulnerability in a
code library used by the application."
Maybe give an example of how app sensor will actually do this. For
example how would this help to identify and stop an attack
on an application running the vulnerable YAML parser which was used in
many Rails applications, I can't remember the name of the library used
but this is the CVE: http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2013-0156
- -----------------
Another suggestion:

I didn't see anything in the book(although at the time of writing this
at his been some time since I read the book) about using app sensor to
detect people who have gone past exploiting the web application and
now have a shell on your box.  You could perhaps use app sensor to for
example check any activity on
the machine running as the www-data or www user and doing something
out of the ordinary.  I'm not sure how this would be done , but just a
thought.

Timo

Thank you very much for taking the time to provide feedback on the
AppSensor Guide. We want to keep improving it and it's helpful to me,
and I'm sure others on the list, to receive other people's
perspectives.

My comments in line...

Good catch, "more reliable than other data connectors". I will update the book.

Yes, because there is no lock out.

So a detection point might be "no use of electricity" or something like that?

Interesting. I wonder how the app would "know".

I will look that one up, and expand this text in the book. Thank you.

I think the idea of detecting host, configuration and code changes was
mentioned briefly on this mailing list a few years ago, but it hasn't
really been built upon, and as you say does not appear in the book at
all. I suppose if the host is compromised perhaps we can't trust the
application either, but in our mobile app example we have this
potential issue too. Perhaps we should add a chapter about
physical/environment changes?

Yes, or using below average amount of electricity.

Make the app or the server the app on the meter talks to be able to
notice when no data is sent to or from the meter via the simcard.  So
for example try see if you can send it an sms or if it rings if you call
the number of the simcard.

Yeah I think that is a good idea.

Excellent. I have made a note to add these to the next version of the
book, which will probably be a minor release in November whenever the
v2.0.0 code is released.
