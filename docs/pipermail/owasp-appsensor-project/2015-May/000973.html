<PRE>Ok, waited a few days. Here were my original notes which are a bit of a
brain dump:

- who are the target audience(s) for the dashboard?
    - operations, developers
- what are the use cases that need to be handled? ops room view, attack
research, etc.
    - dashboard on the wall
    - research on attack(s) in progress

- what is the &quot;normal state&quot; - nothing on the screen at all???
    - same as with &quot;active issues&quot;, maybe a message about no data found.
Need to differentiate so we know we're not missing data b/c of a bad
connection. Maybe have a &quot;connected to backend&quot; message displayed somewhere.

- what is usefully displayed?
    - &quot;main&quot; chart of a sliding window (last 5 minutes?), possibly
        - stacked chart with all detection points with sum total
        - something like colin's video of the red/orange/yellow nodes for
each detection point, growing darker the more active they are
        - a bubble chart, bubble per detection point, growing based on
activity (another version of colin's example)
    - some other statistics on the main dashboard:
        - total events over varied recent time ranges (minute, hour, day)
        - scrolling list of recently logged events, attacks, responses
        - most &quot;active&quot; users or IPs
        - avg events/attacks/responses per minute/hour/day, etc. - give
some sort of useful guage to know if &quot;now&quot; is better/worse than usual.

- what sort of patterns would a typical attack look like, and how would
visualisation help highlight this?
    - not sure, need some help from ops folks on this one

- what drill down/view might be useful?
    - by user
        - see data charted over a sliding window of time (default to last
hour?)
        - see what client applications saw this user
        - see a thread of activity (timeline) showing what the user's been
seen doing when
    - by detection point (label - ie. specific detection point)
        - see data charted over a sliding window of time (default to last
hour?)
        - group by client application (20 total, 2 on app A, 18 on app B, 0
on C/D/E)
    - (not for v1) - by metadata
        - if a developer defines custom metadata, we could allow grouping
on some key name - might be useful in custom situations
    - configuration editor
        - need a UI to expose the configuration for detection points and
their associated responses (need admin role)
        - need a serializer/deserializer for save/read

- what do you want to be there for sure?
    - simple, understandable, useful visualizations
    - config editor

- what do you NOT want to be there for sure?
    - too much on the screen
    - the wrong visualizations

- sample tools/views you find helpful?
    - charts using some library ???
    - would like to use websockets - need to beef up support
    - backend likely spring boot / spring security
    - bootstrap
    - jquery
    - not sure about javascript frameworks ... need help :&gt;

- any UI patterns we should use / not use?
    - relying on bootstrap
    - no pie charts :&gt;

Thanks,
John

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Colin is running a couple of sessions at appsec eu related to appsensor.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The first is on Tuesday (5/19) for documentation updates. The second is the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The actual session is Wednesday (5/20) from 13:30 - 17:00 local time

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> )
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The expectation of the session is: &quot;... [design of] a reporting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dashboard. This session is to brainstorm ideas and layouts for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dashboard, and identify what tools/libraries can assist in the creation of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the dashboard. Bring ideas, energy, URLs, paper and pens! The outputs will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be dashboard mockups.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In preparation for this meeting, we'd like to give everyone an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opportunity for early input. Specifically, we are looking for:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - who are the target audience(s) for the dashboard?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - what are the use cases that need to be handled? ops room view, attack
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> research, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - what is the &quot;normal state&quot; - nothing on the screen at all???
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - what is usefully displayed?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - what sort of patterns would a typical attack look like, and how would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> visualisation help highlight this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - what drill down/view might be useful?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - what do you want to be there for sure?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - what do you NOT want to be there for sure?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - sample tools/views you find helpful?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - any UI patterns we should use / not use?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These questions are just examples to get you thinking. ANY and ALL input
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is valuable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let me be clear - *THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO INFLUENCE THE UI ! *Feedback /
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> input is critical at this point. This will be the main development effort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the next couple of months, so input now is crucial to building
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something useful.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We're also considering holding a phone call this week or early next if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people would find that useful as a way to provide input. Please let me or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Colin know if you'd be interested in joining a call, and if there's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interest, we'll set it up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> John
