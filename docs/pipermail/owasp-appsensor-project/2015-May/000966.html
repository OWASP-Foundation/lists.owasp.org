<PRE>I would like to see:

An overall status (could be a gauge or speedometer or whatever) showing the current amount of sensor activity.
The ability to click any sensor current and see historic activity (charts)
The ability to click an ip or session and see events (sensors triggered, actions taken etc.)
Geographic IP info.
Not sure if this is within scope, but list currently blocked ips. Ability to block/unblock and whitelist (while running pentests) IPs.

Emne: [Owasp-appsensor-project] appsensor dashboard design prep for appseceu

All, 


Colin is running a couple of sessions at appsec eu related to appsensor. The first is on Tuesday (5/19) for documentation updates. The second is the reason for this email. 

The actual session is Wednesday (5/20) from 13:30 - 17:00 local time (Amsterdam, NL). (<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Project_Summit_2015/Home#13:30_.E2.80.93_17:00_AppSensor_.28Code.29_.E2.80.93_Dashboard">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Project_Summit_2015/Home#13:30_.E2.80.93_17:00_AppSensor_.28Code.29_.E2.80.93_Dashboard</A>)


The expectation of the session is: &quot;... [design of] a reporting dashboard. This session is to brainstorm ideas and layouts for the dashboard, and identify what tools/libraries can assist in the creation of the dashboard. Bring ideas, energy, URLs, paper and pens! The outputs will be dashboard mockups.&quot;



In preparation for this meeting, we'd like to give everyone an opportunity for early input. Specifically, we are looking for:

- who are the target audience(s) for the dashboard?

- what are the use cases that need to be handled? ops room view, attack research, etc.

- what is the &quot;normal state&quot; - nothing on the screen at all???
- what is usefully displayed?
- what sort of patterns would a typical attack look like, and how would visualisation help highlight this?
- what drill down/view might be useful?

- what do you want to be there for sure?

- what do you NOT want to be there for sure?

- sample tools/views you find helpful?

- any UI patterns we should use / not use?


These questions are just examples to get you thinking. ANY and ALL input is valuable.



Let me be clear - THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO INFLUENCE THE UI ! Feedback / input is critical at this point. This will be the main development effort for the next couple of months, so input now is crucial to building something useful. 


We're also considering holding a phone call this week or early next if people would find that useful as a way to provide input. Please let me or Colin know if you'd be interested in joining a call, and if there's interest, we'll set it up.



Thanks,

John
