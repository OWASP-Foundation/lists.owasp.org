<PRE>&gt;<i>- who are the target audience(s) for the dashboard?
</I>People in operations who are running infrastructure that the application is
hosted on.


&gt;<i>- what are the use cases that need to be handled? ops room view, attack
</I>research, etc.
Attack research, ops rooms. Would also be nice to see appsensor used
BlueTeam vs Red Team CTF competitions , could be used by the Blue Teams.
Would be a good place to put Appsensor to the test. Would be cool to use
AppSensor to monitor an app running in a competition like this:

&gt;<i>- what is the &quot;normal state&quot; - nothing on the screen at all???
</I>Normal traffic, no anomalies in log data.

- what is usefully displayed?
- what sort of patterns would a typical attack look like, and how would
visualisation help highlight this?
&gt;<i>- what drill down/view might be useful?
</I>Would be interesting and helpful to see information especially at the
enumeration stage of an attack. Also would be interesting to see traffic
coming from blacklisted IP's.

- what do you want to be there for sure?
- what do you NOT want to be there for sure?
- sample tools/views you find helpful?
&gt;<i>- any UI patterns we should use / not use?
</I>Not sure what is meant by this question. But I'd like to see us something
like Elasticsearch+Logstash+Kibana. I'm still figuring out myself how to
use this &quot;ELK&quot; stack which can make really nice looking dashboards like
these:

I'm going to try attend both sessions.  I will be in Amsterdam. Looking
forward to meeting all of you smart people.

Regards.

&gt;<i> All,

</I>&gt;<i> Colin is running a couple of sessions at appsec eu related to appsensor.
</I>&gt;<i> The first is on Tuesday (5/19) for documentation updates. The second is the
</I>&gt;<i> reason for this email.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The actual session is Wednesday (5/20) from 13:30 - 17:00 local time
</I>&gt;<i> (Amsterdam, NL). (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Project_Summit_2015/Home#13:30_.E2.80.93_17:00_AppSensor_.28Code.29_.E2.80.93_Dashboard">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Project_Summit_2015/Home#13:30_.E2.80.93_17:00_AppSensor_.28Code.29_.E2.80.93_Dashboard</A>
</I>&gt;<i> )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The expectation of the session is: &quot;... [design of] a reporting dashboard.
</I>&gt;<i> This session is to brainstorm ideas and layouts for the dashboard, and
</I>&gt;<i> identify what tools/libraries can assist in the creation of the dashboard.
</I>&gt;<i> Bring ideas, energy, URLs, paper and pens! The outputs will be dashboard
</I>&gt;<i> mockups.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In preparation for this meeting, we'd like to give everyone an opportunity
</I>&gt;<i> for early input. Specifically, we are looking for:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - who are the target audience(s) for the dashboard?
</I>&gt;<i> - what are the use cases that need to be handled? ops room view, attack
</I>&gt;<i> research, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> - what is the &quot;normal state&quot; - nothing on the screen at all???
</I>&gt;<i> - what is usefully displayed?
</I>&gt;<i> - what sort of patterns would a typical attack look like, and how would
</I>&gt;<i> visualisation help highlight this?
</I>&gt;<i> - what drill down/view might be useful?
</I>&gt;<i> - what do you want to be there for sure?
</I>&gt;<i> - what do you NOT want to be there for sure?
</I>&gt;<i> - sample tools/views you find helpful?
</I>&gt;<i> - any UI patterns we should use / not use?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These questions are just examples to get you thinking. ANY and ALL input
</I>&gt;<i> is valuable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me be clear - *THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO INFLUENCE THE UI ! *Feedback /
</I>&gt;<i> input is critical at this point. This will be the main development effort
</I>&gt;<i> for the next couple of months, so input now is crucial to building
</I>&gt;<i> something useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're also considering holding a phone call this week or early next if
</I>&gt;<i> people would find that useful as a way to provide input. Please let me or
</I>&gt;<i> Colin know if you'd be interested in joining a call, and if there's
</I>&gt;<i> interest, we'll set it up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> John
