<PRE>Kevin

Thank you for getting this feedback. I think perhaps it's something to
discuss in the book (coming soon!). If anyone else has further
viewpoints or insights, please contribute them.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Requirement 6.6 has been changed:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    &quot;Increased flexibility by specifying automated technical solution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that detects and prevents web-based attacks rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;web-application firewall.&quot; Added note to clarify that this assessment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     is not the same as vulnerability scans required at 11.2.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That sounds awfully like AppSensor. The detailed text is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    &quot;6.6 For public-facing web applications, ensure that either one of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     following methods is in place as follows:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     * Examine ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     * Examine the system configuration settings and interview responsible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       personnel to verify that an automated technical solution that detects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       and prevents web-based attacks (for example, a web-application
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       firewall) is in place as follows:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       - Is situated in front of public-facing web applications to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         detect and prevent web-based attacks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       - Is actively running and up to date as applicable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       - Is generating audit logs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       - Is configured to either block web-based attacks, or generate an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         alert.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I suspect &quot;in front&quot; could be &quot;inside in front of business logic&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not being as optimistic as Colin, I asked a friend and former colleague
</I>&gt;<i> of mine who happens to be a certified PCI auditor for his company his
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation of this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My sense of why the PCI DSS wording change was altered was to better
</I>&gt;<i> accomodate things like Apache's mod_security. Because AppSensor detection
</I>&gt;<i> points are generally instrumented by the application development team
</I>&gt;<i> rather than a separate security team or operations team, I was skeptical
</I>&gt;<i> whether or not PCI auditors would accept AppSensor as satisfying these
</I>&gt;<i> PCI DSS 3.0 requirements. Hence my reason for asking my former colleague.
</I>&gt;<i> I also asked him if PCI had some sort of central board that could rule on
</I>&gt;<i> this should we find that auditors were not accepting AppSensor to address
</I>&gt;<i> these PCI requirements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My friend's response is below. I suggest you read through it. I think
</I>&gt;<i> his statement's are encouraging.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> NSA: All your crypto bit are belong to us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ---------- Forwarded message ----------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What Colin sent is the testing procedures for the new 3.0. The requirement
</I>&gt;<i> reads, in part, like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot; ...Installing an automated technical solution (emphasis mine) that
</I>&gt;<i>     detects and prevents web-based attacks (for example, a web-application
</I>&gt;<i>     firewall) in front of public-facing web applications, to continually
</I>&gt;<i>     check all traffic&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this case the WAF was used as an example only and I would think you
</I>&gt;<i> could make a case using AppSensor meets these requirements as long as
</I>&gt;<i> the other (alerting, blocking, logging) are met too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the PCI-DSS 3.0 Summary of Changes document, this is noted as a
</I>&gt;<i> clarification of the existing requirement with this note:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;Increased flexibility by specifying automated technical solution that
</I>&gt;<i>     detects and prevents web-based attacks rather than &quot;web-application
</I>&gt;<i>     firewall.&quot; Added note to clarify that this assessment is not the same
</I>&gt;<i>     as vulnerability scans required at 11.2&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [Note from me: So as you can see, my conjecture about this was wrong and
</I>&gt;<i> this not added to address things like mod_security.]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Usually clarifying guidance would be done through the FAQs or an Information
</I>&gt;<i> Supplement. I&#8217;m not sure if the SSC would render an opinion on a specific
</I>&gt;<i> technology though. I&#8217;ve not submitted a question and would have to investigate
</I>&gt;<i> that process. OWASP may have some representation somewhere on the PCI council
</I>&gt;<i> since they are referenced in the DSS.
