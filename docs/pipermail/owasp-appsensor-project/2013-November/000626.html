Not being as optimistic as Colin, I asked a friend and former colleague
of mine who happens to be a certified PCI auditor for his company his
interpretation of this.

My sense of why the PCI DSS wording change was altered was to better
accomodate things like Apache's mod_security. Because AppSensor detection
points are generally instrumented by the application development team
rather than a separate security team or operations team, I was skeptical
whether or not PCI auditors would accept AppSensor as satisfying these
PCI DSS 3.0 requirements. Hence my reason for asking my former colleague.
I also asked him if PCI had some sort of central board that could rule on
this should we find that auditors were not accepting AppSensor to address
these PCI requirements.

My friend's response is below. I suggest you read through it. I think
his statement's are encouraging.

What Colin sent is the testing procedures for the new 3.0. The requirement
reads, in part, like this:

    &quot; ...Installing an automated technical solution (emphasis mine) that
    detects and prevents web-based attacks (for example, a web-application
    firewall) in front of public-facing web applications, to continually
    check all traffic&quot;.

In this case the WAF was used as an example only and I would think you
could make a case using AppSensor meets these requirements as long as
the other (alerting, blocking, logging) are met too.

In the PCI-DSS 3.0 Summary of Changes document, this is noted as a
clarification of the existing requirement with this note:

    &quot;Increased flexibility by specifying automated technical solution that
    detects and prevents web-based attacks rather than &quot;web-application
    firewall.&quot; Added note to clarify that this assessment is not the same
    as vulnerability scans required at 11.2&quot;.

[Note from me: So as you can see, my conjecture about this was wrong and
this not added to address things like mod_security.]

Usually clarifying guidance would be done through the FAQs or an Information
Supplement. I&#8217;m not sure if the SSC would render an opinion on a specific
technology though. I&#8217;ve not submitted a question and would have to investigate
that process. OWASP may have some representation somewhere on the PCI council
since they are referenced in the DSS.
