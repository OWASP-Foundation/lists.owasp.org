<PRE>Michael

&gt;<i> I am not sure, Michael.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am ccing Colin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Colin, has something changed regarding the AppSensor book on Lulu since you
</I>&gt;<i> are working on the new version? Let us know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you, Colin.
</I>
I retired free PDF versions of books from Lulu a month or two ago, so
that people can find the printable versions, and because not all PDFs
we have were on there.  Lulu was not being maintained. No print
versions were retired by me.  We are waiting for peopel to be
available for a discussion (i.e. after AppSec USA) before having a
discussion on some list about how people find books in various
formats, and languages.

Regarding the v1.1 AppSensor book. I think it has disappeared because
Lulu has recently retired some formats:

   <A HREF="http://connect.lulu.com/t5/Lulu-Announcements/Update-Discontinued-Print-Book-Formats/m-p/249775#U249775">http://connect.lulu.com/t5/Lulu-Announcements/Update-Discontinued-Print-Book-Formats/m-p/249775#U249775</A>


The printed book appears in &quot;retired&quot; list bit cannot be published
because Lulu no longer supports that format for the number of
pages/colours. Therefore it cannot be unretired. Presumably OWASP was
notified about this?

I was intending to update the AppSensor project page to the newer
layouts, but will now prioritise that and remove that Lulu link.
Instead I will put a link to the PDF version. So watch out!

In the near future (January?) we ought to have the v2 book, which will
be in a format that Lulu currently supports. The new version is staill
in draft and has never been uploaded to Lulu. It won't be until it is
ready for wider release.

Colin
