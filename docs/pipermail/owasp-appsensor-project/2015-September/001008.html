<PRE>All,

Just wanted to send out a quick note. It's been a VERY busy summer for the
appsensor project. Here are the key updates:

*1. *We just completed the OWASP summer code sprint. We had a fantastic
student (Sumanth, cc'ed) working with a great Mentor (Timo, cc'ed) and
myself on a couple of exciting projects. Over the course of just 6 weeks.
Sumanth was able to get output from appsensor integrated into 2 different
visualization stacks.

The first was ELK (elasticsearch - logstash - kibana) and the second was
influxdb / grafana. Both of these visualization toolsets are very popular
and, importantly, already integrated into many organizations. These
projects showed that the appsensor data can easily be brought into an
organization no matter the environment. This really shows off the hard work
done on integration for the overall project. It also gives folks a couple
of good options (that work out of the box) for using industry-standard &quot;big
data&quot; tools with appsensor data.

For anyone who's worked with these tools, you know 6 weeks is a challenging
timeline to get one of these things done, much less two. I can't say enough
about the work Sumanth and Timo did. It was a lot of effort, and the
results are excellent.

*2.* I just sent out the first release candidate for 2.2.0. The significant
thing about this release is it's the first appearance of 'appsensor-ui'.
The UI is a simple dashboard that will be maintained over time to support
the growing needs of the appsensor users. I've kept it simple for now, but
feedback will really help drive the design and use of the tool. Thanks to
all who contributed ideas and designs here - they were immensely useful.

*3. *I'll be speaking at AppSec USA about appsensor. If you will be there,
I would love to chat. Feel free to reach out. Also attend the presentation
if you can, should be a lot of fun to show off what different people have
been working on. I'll be presenting the work Sumanth / Timo did as well as
a couple of other very interesting and exciting side projects.

Thanks,
John
