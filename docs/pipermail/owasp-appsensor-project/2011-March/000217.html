Yes, sorry I perhaps wasn't quite answering your original question,
but I thought I should share where I had got to with logging ideas
last year.  The ESAPI security event logging was the original
inspiration, but I found I wanted more structured details.

The other sources of information I looked at regarding application logging were:

   How to Do Application Logging Right,  Anton Chuvakin and Gunnar Peterson
   <A HREF="http://arctecgroup.net/pdf/howtoapplogging.pdf">http://arctecgroup.net/pdf/howtoapplogging.pdf</A>

   OWASP Logging Project
   <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Logging_Project">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Logging_Project</A>

   NIST SP 800-92
   <A HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-92/SP800-92.pdf">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-92/SP800-92.pdf</A>

You'll see ideas drawn from all of those.

Your description of different handlers sounds good.  I know not
everyone will want or require the same level of logging, but it would
be nice to have a wide range of options built in, even if we allow
NULL for most fields.

The logs will be important for the user and system trend detection
points, hence the ideas of recording a unique request number, the
particular URL, the particular module/function, the target, the user's
identity and the results.

Happy rumination!
