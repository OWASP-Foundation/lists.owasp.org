<PRE>Here is the CEF library that Mozilla wrote. We use it in many of our python apps. Its now available at pypi.org

<A HREF="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cef/0.1">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cef/0.1</A>

CEF information can be found here:
www.arcsight.com/collateral/CEFstandards.pdf
<A HREF="http://www.arcsight.com/solutions/solutions-cef/">http://www.arcsight.com/solutions/solutions-cef/</A>

Unfortunately the full CEF document requires registration with ArcSight. I contacted them in regards to getting an open copy for adoption within AppSensor

&gt;<i> These ideas sound great. Responses inline below.

</I>&gt;<i> Also, I asked on this list a while back, and I'll try again as there may be new folks on, does anyone have a doc that describes the common event format (CEF)? I would like to write something that will log to this format, but I don't have any tools that read it, or any documentation on how to write it.  This could be a useful log format, as I understand it can be fed into SEIM tools. Any pointers here would be helpful.  Some of the questions and comments I've heard seem to point to the fact that supporting various output formats is a definite positive for this project going forward.

</I>&gt;<i> The AppSensor session at the OWASP World Summit was a great success. The focus of the discussion was where should AppSensor go next.  We covered all of the available items within the AppSensor project (AppSensor.jar w/ESAPI plugin, detection points guidance, extensive documentation, live running demos defendtheapp.com, etc) and posed the question &quot;What do we need for your company to adopt AppSensor within your applications&quot;.  There was lots of energy in the room and all 50+ seats were filled.  AppSensor is really starting to take off and I'm excited at these results.  These ideas represent the next areas for the project to tackle in order to obtain wide adoption.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here are the outputs of that discussion as action items for the project.  Consider this an invitation for anyone to jump into the AppSensor project and lead one of these areas to success (email me and I can give you more info and support your efforts)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Concern over False Positives
</I>&gt;<i> ** Article to discuss why AppSensor false positives won't result in negative system performance or adversely impact non-malicious users. Target Audience: Product Managers, CSOs
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Where is AppSensor integrated into development
</I>&gt;<i> ** Slides or article to demonstrate process of selecting AppSensor detection points during the threat modeling phase. Notes on how to communicate these requirements to developers. How to test proper deployment
</I>&gt;<i> I have a couple ideas on this, and will get around to doing a better job documenting that soon I hope, but if anyone else wants to take it or help out, I'd appreciate it. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Is there an AppSensor-like implementation that could be handled by operations?
</I>&gt;<i> ** This is not the traditional AppSensor approach (e.g. within the code), but we could do further research on aspect oriented implementations or real time log analysis for attack monitoring
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting - partly related to my CEF question above.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> * Integration with libraries and frameworks
</I>&gt;<i> ** Sub project to submit patches for common frameworks to log obvious attack types. The goal is to at least get the logging of attack scenarios in place by default. This makes it easier to adopt an AppSensor approach onto these libraries or frameworks
</I>&gt;<i> ** Possible first target : Sonar (sonarsource.org) - May need to get more info on this idea
</I>&gt;<i> This is interesting.  I'm curious what the thought is here. If you wanted to get AppSensor logging in here, you'd include the AppSensor jar and start going.  However, that doesn't seem to be the idea.  Is it that we're trying to introduce the concept of logging attacks as opposed to ignoring them?  Also, Sonar (from a brief look) appears to be a code analysis tool. Is the idea that the logging would show up on some analysis style dashboard? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Testimonials from companies using AppSensor or AppSensor-like capabilities
</I>&gt;<i> ** This wil help raise confidence in the project for potential new adopters
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would be VERY cool - the ESAPI project did something similar that seemed to work well. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Software - Code versioning, patching, support ?
</I>&gt;<i> ** This is a common concern for open source software and OWASP code. What can we do to help make our code more digestible by a company looking for these more stringent development patterns?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is always an issue w/ open source tools, and won't be fixed by our project.  Since it's open source, you do have the option to patch it yourself, but that's not often palatable to many organizations.  There are times when commercial entities spin off and support projects (like Spring, MySQL), but generally those are much larger projects.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> * Link in with Fraud systems
</I>&gt;<i> ** The AppSensor project has been contacted by a large bank to help develop a strategy for detection of fraud through session hijacking and phishing.
</I>&gt;<i> This is very cool.  I'd be curious to know more about the request and if there are any specific requirements.
