</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The AppSensor session at the OWASP World Summit was a great success. The
</I>&gt;<i> focus of the discussion was where should AppSensor go next.  We covered all
</I>&gt;<i> of the available items within the AppSensor project (AppSensor.jar w/ESAPI
</I>&gt;<i> plugin, detection points guidance, extensive documentation, live running
</I>&gt;<i> demos defendtheapp.com, etc) and posed the question &quot;What do we need for
</I>&gt;<i> your company to adopt AppSensor within your applications&quot;.  There was lots
</I>&gt;<i> of energy in the room and all 50+ seats were filled.  AppSensor is really
</I>&gt;<i> starting to take off and I'm excited at these results.  These ideas
</I>&gt;<i> represent the next areas for the project to tackle in order to obtain wide
</I>&gt;<i> adoption.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here are the outputs of that discussion as action items for the project.
</I>&gt;<i>  Consider this an invitation for anyone to jump into the AppSensor project
</I>&gt;<i> and lead one of these areas to success (email me and I can give you more
</I>&gt;<i> info and support your efforts)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Concern over False Positives
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ** Article to discuss why AppSensor false positives won't result in
</I>&gt;<i> negative system performance or adversely impact non-malicious users. Target
</I>&gt;<i> Audience: Product Managers, CSOs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Where is AppSensor integrated into development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ** Slides or article to demonstrate process of selecting AppSensor
</I>&gt;<i> detection points during the threat modeling phase. Notes on how to
</I>&gt;<i> communicate these requirements to developers. How to test proper deployment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a couple ideas on this, and will get around to doing a better job
</I>&gt;<i> documenting that soon I hope, but if anyone else wants to take it or help
</I>&gt;<i> out, I'd appreciate it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Is there an AppSensor-like implementation that could be handled by
</I>&gt;<i> operations?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ** This is not the traditional AppSensor approach (e.g. within the code),
</I>&gt;<i> but we could do further research on aspect oriented implementations or real
</I>&gt;<i> time log analysis for attack monitoring
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Interesting - partly related to my CEF question above.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Integration with libraries and frameworks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ** Sub project to submit patches for common frameworks to log obvious
</I>&gt;<i> attack types. The goal is to at least get the logging of attack scenarios in
</I>&gt;<i> place by default. This makes it easier to adopt an AppSensor approach onto
</I>&gt;<i> these libraries or frameworks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ** Possible first target : Sonar (sonarsource.org) - May need to get
</I>&gt;<i> more info on this idea
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is interesting.  I'm curious what the thought is here. If you wanted
</I>&gt;<i> to get AppSensor logging in here, you'd include the AppSensor jar and start
</I>&gt;<i> going.  However, that doesn't seem to be the idea.  Is it that we're trying
</I>&gt;<i> to introduce the concept of logging attacks as opposed to ignoring them?
</I>&gt;<i>  Also, Sonar (from a brief look) appears to be a code analysis tool. Is the
</I>&gt;<i> idea that the logging would show up on some analysis style dashboard?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Testimonials from companies using AppSensor or AppSensor-like
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ** This wil help raise confidence in the project for potential new
</I>&gt;<i> adopters
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This would be VERY cool - the ESAPI project did something similar that
</I>&gt;<i> seemed to work well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Software - Code versioning, patching, support ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ** This is a common concern for open source software and OWASP code. What
</I>&gt;<i> can we do to help make our code more digestible by a company looking for
</I>&gt;<i> these more stringent development patterns?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is always an issue w/ open source tools, and won't be fixed by our
</I>&gt;<i> project.  Since it's open source, you do have the option to patch it
</I>&gt;<i> yourself, but that's not often palatable to many organizations.  There are
</I>&gt;<i> times when commercial entities spin off and support projects (like Spring,
</I>&gt;<i> MySQL), but generally those are much larger projects.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Link in with Fraud systems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ** The AppSensor project has been contacted by a large bank to help
</I>&gt;<i> develop a strategy for detection of fraud through session hijacking and
</I>&gt;<i> phishing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is very cool.  I'd be curious to know more about the request and if
</I>&gt;<i> there are any specific requirements.
