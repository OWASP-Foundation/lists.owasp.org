I just listened to the OWASP Podcast and I really like where this project is
headed!  I've thought about this a lot and I believe there is a huge amount
of value in this kind of defense.  The detection methods don't need to be
very complex to work; I bet you could detect me, as an attacker, by only
monitoring one or two parameters.  AppSensor seems like it would be worth
the development effort for just about every sensitive application.

A coworker of mine tested an application once that locked out his account
every time it detected malicious input.  I think he pretty much was limited
to acting as a normal user and only passively looking for vulnerabilities
(e.g., logic flaws, not using SSL, HTTPOnly not set, etc.).

One more detection point you could add is a list of common usernames that do
not exist in the application.  For example, the AppSensor would detect an
attack when I tried to log in as "administrator" and "admin", because those
are not real usernames for this application.

Another detection idea is to insert fake parameters (e.g. uID=0), to see if
they are ever modified.  This is more of a honey pot approach, but I guess
you don't need to detect every attack, just one (good is the enemy of
great).

Have you considered integrating this with ESAPI?  It seems like you could
tie AppSensor in with the ESAPI functions to detect a lot of these attacks
without modifying the code (assuming the application was developed using
ESAPI).

I'd love to help out with this project, although I am very busy right now.
Let me know if there is anything I can do to help, otherwise I will plan on
lurking on the mailing list.

I like the idea of unexpected common usernames (wrong key used in the
AppSensor defending banks and stores analogy) and fake parameters
(small shiny goos in the shop with alarm tags in them).

But you reminded me to write something up which I mentioned in passing
to Michael Coates.

In a previous discussion I'd mentioned the concept of having sensor
input from other locations such as the web server, WAF, XML firewall,
etc that could add to knowledge about the actions of a particular
user.  But on the way to AppSec DC I read the specification for
Firefox's Content Security Policy.  There is a violation report
syntax:

https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/CSP/Spec#Violation_Report_Syntax

which can be used by the user agent to send an XML report back to the
content provider.  Perhaps another potential optional sensor feed?
