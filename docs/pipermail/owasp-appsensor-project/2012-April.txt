You can ask me any questions you might have directly off list. You
don't actually have to submit the proposal to the list. Have a look at
[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSoC] and let me know if you have
further questions about submission. Essentially, you'll submit
directly to Google and then we (OWASP) will get to review all the
submissions. Glad to have your interest in the project!

Dear Sir,

Although I have not used AppSensor before and heard of it for the first
time in the GSoC Project, I am very interested in working for this project.

But there is one problem, if someone can please guide me how to get
started. I studied a lot about it and downloaded the code for AppSensor too
but I am used to Windows application development (GUI based) and still very
new to this kind of development environment (Linux and command based).

Please guide me how should i start using the AppSensor? Is there a page
which defines that? The description at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_Developer_Guide#Obtaining_AppSensor
seems to be very high level and i don't understand much from it.

Please advise.

Regards
Ahmad Javaid

All,
I've worked directly with several of the students on list that would like
to participate in the Google summer of code project and apply to the
appsensor project. That is great news and I'm really excited about the
possibility of having the help. I just wanted to send out a brief reminder
to those who haven't yet submitted their proposals (some of you already
have) that the deadline in *April 6th*. If you have any more questions,
feel free to contact me.

Thanks,
John

Hi,

My name is Qixuan Zhang, currently an IT student from UNC Charlotte. I  
subscribed yesterday but for some reason was not able to send email to the  
list. Hope it works now. Thanks to Mr. Melton who introduce this project  
to me, I find it really interesting.
After going through the ideas posted online, I find that No. 4,5 and 6  
interest me. Apparently I cannot do them all, but I will try look deeper  
into it. Also a question about the developer's guide: is there a sample  
web application that I can try implementing the AppSensor on? (I think  
there is one in the video) It may save some time if such a sample already
exists.
I am familiar with Java, C, HTML/CSS/JS and have a basic understanding of  
security. I have worked with ESAPI before and have read part of its  
library. This week I will go through the source of AppSensor and see what  
I can do.

Regards,
Qixuan Zhang (Quentin)

As John Melton and others on this list have mentioned that you still need
to submit your proposal to the GSoC site at:

   http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012

If you need more details, see the OWASP Wiki at:
    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSoC#Instructions_for_students
and the GSoC FAQ, particularly:
    http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2012/faqs#student_apply

Looking forward to your formal proposal.

Good luck,
-kevin

As Kevin pointed out, you'll need to submit your application directly to
Google and we'll be notified of that. To your question regarding a sample
app, the only one I have available is the demo app. It's trivial, but does
show the basics - you can find the code here -
http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/trunk/AppSensorDemo2/

Thanks,

Hi Giri,

Apologies. Google said on submission that OWASP team should have access to
it but it seems not. Anyway, you should be able to access now.

Rauf

Hi,

I have pretty much finished my application but I am waiting for a  
couple of recommendation letters. Can I submit it, receive comments,  
and re-submit a complete version until Friday? Is it possible to  
provide the recommendation letters even after the deadline?

Thank you,

Dimitris,
I'm not sure about that. I know the 6th is the deadline for submission, so
I would aim to have everything in by then.
Thanks,

Hi AppSensor crowd (just subscribed to this list)

I have a question: Is there a 'HowTo' on how to add AppSensor to a Spring

Hi , I'm the lead developer of https://github.com/TeamMentor/Master which
is a .NET/jQuery based WebApp.

I have a couple bug-tracking-issues that I would like to address using
AppSensor:

- Login Brute Force
- Mass Account creation
- WebServices API abuse

I have an OKish overview of AppSensor (saw Colin present it a couple
times), but am not sure on where to start. Any tips/ideas?

Thanks

Dinis

You should implement localised mis-use prevention for these 3 examples
in your own code. For example "API abuse" is probably being detected
by authorisation and input validation checks?  AppSensor can't be used
to protect an application that isn't doing these things already, or
has known or easily found vulnerabilities.

AppSensor might then be used to detect an attack if it saw (for
example) 6 or 10 instances of any of the three things you mention by
an IP address range or subnet (e.g. 2 login account lockouts, plus 3
new accounts and 1 API abuse = 6 events).

1. Consider where in your architecture you could detect these sort of
events (existing checks?), and whether this can be achieved with an
common code

2. Make sure you have application logging capabilities

3. Start to log the events

4. Consider what type of responses are appropriate (time delays, lock outs, etc)

5. Build mechanisms to undertake/enforce the responses

6. Use something (engine, query on logs, etc) to detect the thresholds
you have set e.g. "6 of any", "3 account lockouts"

7. Undertake the predefined responses

Dinis,
No, there is no documentation at all for doing this specifically for spring
apps. Just as a heads up, the project is currently going through a
re-architecturing (not a word). The current version is constrained by lots
of factors, but it's fairly easy to add appsensor to any java app, not just
a spring app. The basic idea for configuring the current version is:
1. Perform steps to add ESAPI (we have a pretty tight dependency on ESAPI
in the current architecture)
2. Add the appsensor jar file to WEB-INF/lib (latest is always in maven
central)
3. Add an appsensor.properties file to the .esapi directory that contains
your appsensor configuration - a sample file can be retrieved from the test
code source or demo app source
4. Start adding detection points, which involves adding the java code in
the appropriate place, and configuration matching that detection point
code: a couple simple examples are found here:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_Developer_Guide#Using_AppSensor_in_your_project

Let me know if you have further questions.
Thanks,
John

Dinis,
I also didn't clarify this well in my email response (just a moment ago) to
your spring app question. The current version of appsensor ONLY supports
java applications. The concept is obviously generic, but our code is only
for java at the moment. The new version will be services based, so we can
quickly and easily build new clients in any language. Colin is spot on in
his response otherwise.
Thanks,
John

Dinis,
If I'm not mistaken, I believe the hook for
AppSensor in ESAPI is in the
IntrusionDetector interface and the
EnterpriseSecurityException class.

If you mimic something like that &
have a way to get AppSensor's properties set,
you should be able to get it working in Spring.

I should have mentioned this "implementation planning guide":

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=File:Appsensor-planning.zip&setlang=en

It might help your thought processes.

Hi John,

I am sending my application attached herewith. Please give a look at it and
suggest changes.

Please tell me what can i do make it more concrete. Are there any other
tasks you would like me to do before the project starts? Also, can you
suggest me any benchmarking standards which I can use as part of the
proposal? I have included the NIST-Test Suite #69: Juliet Test Suite for
Java (http://samate.nist.gov/SRD/view.php?tsID=69) in my proposal for
benchmarking requirement.

Eagerly waiting for your valuable feedback.

Regards
Ahmad

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Cheat sheet?
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBmuiDfRT2FX9YZTcqUHt6hH++ND-oYorsmEBSTa=6Zo5A@mail.gmail.com>

The cheat sheet series seems to be moving along at a rapid pace:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cheat_Sheets

There's a discussion over on the GPC list about creating some printed
copies for handouts fairly soon. So I have just produced a first draft
of a logging cheat sheet today:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Logging_Cheat_Sheet

I think Jim M will circulate this for wider contribution/discussion. I
wanted to have something (somewhere else) we can refer to from
AppSensor without getting AppSensor bogged down in talking about
logging.

Do you think we could produce a cheat sheet for AppSensor-like
functionality and perhaps call it more generically the "Attack
Detection & Response Cheat Sheet"? It might help get the idea out
there and can be a platform to clear up misconceptions.

Colin
