<PRE>Hi Marek,

Responses inline. I'll give the most honest feedback I can, with the caveat
that I'm project lead and hence am necessarily somewhat biased.

Hope this helps.

Thanks,
John

&gt;<i> Hello Everyone!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have some short questions regarding OWASP AppSensor, as I am to decide
</I>&gt;<i> whether we are going to pursue this topic in my company in the following
</I>&gt;<i> year. I have read a big part of the AppSensor guide, run some examples (had
</I>&gt;<i> some minor issues to fix in my local code copy to make it run), looked over
</I>&gt;<i> the code. I think I have a basic understanding of how it is supposed to
</I>&gt;<i> work so far. On one hand I think the tools is a brilliant idea, something
</I>&gt;<i> our industry is missing right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There are starting to be some commercial tools that overlap with appsensor.
I'm happy to speak with you about that on a separate thread if you're
interested. I try not to discuss that on list due to OWASP remaining
vendor-neutral. I'll give you honest feedback about what I've heard about
those tools though if you like.


&gt;<i> On the other &#8211; I have doubts about quality and future of the libraries. I
</I>&gt;<i> would like to know:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -        If you know anybody who integrated or are integrating AppSensor
</I>&gt;<i> in their applications? Names of the companies/products would be helpful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I've requested this several times over the years, and no one has ever
_publicly_ said &quot;yes, we're using appsensor&quot;. The closest we've come is
Mozilla saying they use the concept (I happen to know they built their own
python implementation and are _not_ using our code, or at least that was
true in their first implementation.

Having said that, I do know of several (15-20 at last count) companies that
are actually using the implementation. I have been asked not to mention
them by name, so I won't. The reason given by everyone is sensitivity of
the implementation of security controls. What I can say is that the
verticals for these companies are financials, high-tech, and healthcare. I
recognize the irritation of not being able to discuss the tool directly
with users, and this is frustrating to me as well. I've asked 3 users in
the past couple months to give me permission to put their company logos on
our site, and from what I understand, it's going through the approval
process now.

&gt;<i> -        Do you know any other vendors who build up alternatives to the
</I>&gt;<i> AppSensor libraries? I think WAFs and ALFs are something different. This
</I>&gt;<i> would have to be something that integrates itself with the business code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If you mean competing companies doing similar work, happy to discuss that
in another direct thread. If you mean open source tools, here's the list of
~related tools I know of:
<A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/jtmelton/appsensor-codemash-2017/117">http://www.slideshare.net/jtmelton/appsensor-codemash-2017/117</A> . If you
mean other implementations of the client libraries, no. We have had users
contribute some of our integrations though, but those are now official
projects.


&gt;<i> -        Are there any long term plans to AppSensor development?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The short answer is yes.

The focus areas are analysis engines and visualization.

For analysis engines, we just added the rules engine (boolean logic for
configured rules), and the next steps will be expanding the machine
learning work from GSoC last year and building a trend analysis engine.

For visualization, there are a host of things to handle. In the past we've
generally had users that pulled the data out of appsensor into some other
system in house for visualization (SIEM, or data warehouse). We've gotten
more requests recently though to provide a real UI, something for analysts
to use full-time. Also, the more complex rules engine just added could use
a nice UI for building those rules.

In addition to the 2 main focus areas, there's always work in making the
project more user-friendly, and projects like the &quot;server project
generator&quot; would fall into that bucket. Additionally, integration work
comes up frequently. As an example, there's some work to integrate with
repsheet (a great open source tool with a similar idea, but different
deployment model and tech stack)


&gt;<i> -        How about integration with cloud platforms?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>We don't have any specific plans around this for now. I'm curious to know
what type of integrations you'd be looking for here.

&gt;<i> -        Any other ideas what could be used to convince my colleagues to
</I>&gt;<i> invest their time in AppSensor integration?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Almost universally, every user of our system has had good luck starting
with a very small integration / pilot project. They've targeted a specific
case to prove value (e.g. XSS detection, account takeover, fraud detection,
etc.) and shown that it is possible, simple and actually works. Also note
that it's not always about the response. Several of our users started just
with detection in order to show value.

I generally recommend people start with business logic exceptions, whether
they are security related or not. When you hit an exceptional condition,
fire an event. Others recommend starting with exceptions in security
filters (global checks for sqli, xss, certain headers being set, etc.).
Certainly with new tech AND the new concept of appsensor, small provable
value-add has been most effective from what I've seen.


&gt;<i> Thank you in advance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
