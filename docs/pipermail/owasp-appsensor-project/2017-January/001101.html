<PRE>Hello Everyone!


I have some short questions regarding OWASP AppSensor, as I am to decide
whether we are going to pursue this topic in my company in the following
year. I have read a big part of the AppSensor guide, run some examples (had
some minor issues to fix in my local code copy to make it run), looked over
the code. I think I have a basic understanding of how it is supposed to
work so far. On one hand I think the tools is a brilliant idea, something
our industry is missing right now. On the other &#8211; I have doubts about
quality and future of the libraries. I would like to know:

-        If you know anybody who integrated or are integrating AppSensor in
their applications? Names of the companies/products would be helpful.

-        Do you know any other vendors who build up alternatives to the
AppSensor libraries? I think WAFs and ALFs are something different. This
would have to be something that integrates itself with the business code.

-        Are there any long term plans to AppSensor development?

-        How about integration with cloud platforms?

-        Any other ideas what could be used to convince my colleagues to
invest their time in AppSensor integration?

Thank you in advance.

Best Regards,

Marek Puchalski
