Thought this was a very interesting writeup. The discussion has a lot
of similarities to appsensor in general architecture and design, but
all focused around a unique task (spam prevention).

Thanks,
John

Thanks for sharing. Twitter vs. AppSensor terminology:

   detection point == Tweet text
   events == events
   conditions == thresholds
   actions == responses
