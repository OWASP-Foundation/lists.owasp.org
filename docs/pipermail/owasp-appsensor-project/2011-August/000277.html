This is something similar to the work I had tentatively planned for ESAPI 2.1.
I was planning on doing it when I fix the broken public key crypto. Currently,
in 2.0.x, the key pair is generated on the fly but never persisted, so as soon
as the JVM process dies, the keys disappear as well. Next start-up, you get
a different key pair, which makes the public key crypto in ESAPI 2.0 mostly
useless.  I figured that in 2.1, I'd store / retrieve key pairs in a
Java KeyStore
and password protect the keystore as you have done. I was planning on
offering other alternatives besides having an operations team manually
enter a password, since generally most shops wish to take a lights-out
approach, but there are other possibilities as well. I've already done
things like this in a general key server that my AppSec team wrote
at my day job, so I don't think it would be too hard. I probably could of
had most of it done, but the crypto sections of code more or less had a
code freeze for about 5 months while the NSA was reviewing it.

However, ESAPI would definitely welcome you to contribute your
code to the 'contrib' section. You may want to tidy it up or ask
someone to review it and it's documentation before you contribute
it, but in general, I think it would serve as a great stopgap until
2.1 is available with a more integrated solution.

Chris: What does Theo need to do to be able to commit to the ESAPI 'contrib'
          section?

Thanks,
-kevin
