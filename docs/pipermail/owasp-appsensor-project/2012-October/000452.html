<PRE>AppSensor Team &amp; OWASP Leaders,

Just over 4 years ago I created the AppSensor project as part of OWASP's
Summer of Code.  Since then, the project has amassed a talented volunteer
core, developed into a book, built a sample implementation, multiple
guides, been the topic for academic research projects and even participated
in the Google summer of code.  We've discussed the project around the world
at conferences, with corporations with governments and more.  We've even
been published in the Journal of Defense Crosstalk magazine (
<A HREF="http://www.crosstalkonline.org/issues/septoct-2011.html">http://www.crosstalkonline.org/issues/septoct-2011.html</A>) and are featured
on the Department of Homeland Security's website for building resilient
software (<A HREF="https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/swa/resilient.html">https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/swa/resilient.html</A>).

It's been a great ride to say the least.  Many thanks to all of our
contributors with a special shout out to Colin Watson, John Melton and
Dennis Groves.

Letting go of a project like this is always tough. But it's what is best
for the long term success of the AppSensor project.  As many project
creators know, you don't want to walk away entirely and disappear from the
project.  I propose the idea of a &quot;Project Founder&quot; status for OWASP
projects.  I'll continue to be involved, volunteer and advise, but the
direction forward will be built and led by our next AppSensor Project
Leader.

At this point it's time to set it free and let it grow.  Effective today,
I'm opening up the project for nominations for our next AppSensor project
leader. This individual will shepherd the project, be the go-to for key
items and will build and drive the project's roadmap.  They won't be alone
of course - our whole AppSensor team is still here of course! But the
project leader will be a huge voice and driver for the overall success of
AppSensor.


I look forward to seeing what happens next. Thanks again for all those that
have helped bring AppSensor to where it is today and I hope we can all
continue to drive it forward.
