<PRE>Michael,

It is always nerve racking to see a project founder take a public step
back.

However, I certainly understand being over committed - and I sincerely hope
that is the main driver behind your actions. I too believe we should have
&quot;project founders&quot;; and it is fitting for AppSensor to be the first project
to instantiate this practice.

It has been amazing to work with you; on what I believe is such a
fundamental development pattern; that I believe it will one day be 'common
practice.'

I feel honored to have my name mentioned in the same company as Colin
Watson, John Melton and Michael Coates. Thank you for allowing me to
participate and contribute; on such a great project with such great
individuals.

It has been an pleasure to work with you Michael, and a great deal of fun,
I hope we have the opportunity to do so again.

I wish you all the best Michael, in your future endeavors;


Dennis

&gt;<i> AppSensor Team &amp; OWASP Leaders,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just over 4 years ago I created the AppSensor project as part of OWASP's
</I>&gt;<i> Summer of Code.  Since then, the project has amassed a talented volunteer
</I>&gt;<i> core, developed into a book, built a sample implementation, multiple
</I>&gt;<i> guides, been the topic for academic research projects and even participated
</I>&gt;<i> in the Google summer of code.  We've discussed the project around the world
</I>&gt;<i> at conferences, with corporations with governments and more.  We've even
</I>&gt;<i> been published in the Journal of Defense Crosstalk magazine (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.crosstalkonline.org/issues/septoct-2011.html">http://www.crosstalkonline.org/issues/septoct-2011.html</A>) and are featured
</I>&gt;<i> on the Department of Homeland Security's website for building resilient
</I>&gt;<i> software (<A HREF="https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/swa/resilient.html">https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/swa/resilient.html</A>).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's been a great ride to say the least.  Many thanks to all of our
</I>&gt;<i> contributors with a special shout out to Colin Watson, John Melton and
</I>&gt;<i> Dennis Groves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Letting go of a project like this is always tough. But it's what is best
</I>&gt;<i> for the long term success of the AppSensor project.  As many project
</I>&gt;<i> creators know, you don't want to walk away entirely and disappear from the
</I>&gt;<i> project.  I propose the idea of a &quot;Project Founder&quot; status for OWASP
</I>&gt;<i> projects.  I'll continue to be involved, volunteer and advise, but the
</I>&gt;<i> direction forward will be built and led by our next AppSensor Project
</I>&gt;<i> Leader.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this point it's time to set it free and let it grow.  Effective today,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm opening up the project for nominations for our next AppSensor project
</I>&gt;<i> leader. This individual will shepherd the project, be the go-to for key
</I>&gt;<i> items and will build and drive the project's roadmap.  They won't be alone
</I>&gt;<i> of course - our whole AppSensor team is still here of course! But the
</I>&gt;<i> project leader will be a huge voice and driver for the overall success of
</I>&gt;<i> AppSensor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I look forward to seeing what happens next. Thanks again for all those
</I>&gt;<i> that have helped bring AppSensor to where it is today and I hope we can all
</I>&gt;<i> continue to drive it forward.
