<PRE>All,

I'm happy to announce that appsensor version 2.0.0 (final) has been
released.

Note: This is a code release, which comes after a recent (summer 2014) of
version 2 of the appsensor book [see quick downloads at
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project</A> for a link to the
latest version of the book].

The release information is published here:
<A HREF="https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/releases/tag/v2.0.0">https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/releases/tag/v2.0.0</A>

AppSensor has gone through a complete re-write from the previous version
(1.x). Below are the major updates that were most important (and requested)
in v2.

* Client-server architecture supporting multiple communication modes
including: REST, SOAP, Thrift, local (shared JVM, java-only)

* Any language can be used on the client application. The only requirement
is that the language selected must support the communication protocol of
the execution mode that is configured (ie. if using REST as the execution
mode, the language must be capable of making HTTP requests.) The
server-side components are Java, but this places no restriction on the
client applications themselves.

* There is no longer a hard dependency on ESAPI. AppSensor is a standalone
project, though it can be integrated with projects that also use ESAPI if
desired.

* The core components of the system have been renamed and now follow the
appsensor v2 book naming conventions, which is based on standard IDS
terminology for clarity.

* Basic user correlation is supported so that client applications that
share a user base (SSO) can share attack detection/response information.

* A website for the project has been built (appsensor.org).

Many thanks to all those who contributed. Contributors to the overall
project are at [
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project#tab=Acknowledgements">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project#tab=Acknowledgements</A>]
and contributors to the v2 code are at [
<A HREF="https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/graphs/contributors">https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/graphs/contributors</A>]. We also had
many wonderful alpha and beta testers, and I am extremely grateful for all
their feedback in making a better product.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
John
