All,

OWASP is participating in GSoC again this year, which is great news! We
(appsensor) have submitted to be a part of the program, but that means *we
need mentors*. I'm not sure yet whether or not we will be selected, but I
wanted to get an idea of who would be willing to help me mentor students on
these projects.

In general, the time commitment is around a couple of hours per week for
the summer (~12 weeks). It's pretty flexible on availability. I generally
try to respond to emails within 24 hours and do skype/hangouts for more
immediate questions. With proper planning and good students, this works
pretty well.

If you think you could contribute in this way, please let me know. The
number of mentors we get will determine the number of projects we can take
on.

Thanks,
John

Hi John,

I got few questions, could you please clarify?

1) What sort of mentoring? I mean code walk through (or) application
feature mentoring (or) specific to what student working-on?
2) Criteria for mentor selection?
3) What sort of expectations mentor should have (apart from time per week)?

Thank you,
Giri

For mentors, coding ability would be good, yes. Familiarity with the
appsensor codebase is not necessary. The mentoring will be helping the
student work through issues mainly. It's usually helping them work through
roadblocks, and that is a similar process no matter what the project is.

I think the main criteria are 1) have the time and a willingness to help,
and 2) capable developer (java would be best)

The main requirements I generally recommend are:
- 2 meetings per week (30 minutes each) to keep the student on track
- respond to emails within 24 hours
- help perform the midterm and final review
- help research a little when needed

Thanks for the quick reply John! If my profile fits, I would be happy to
mentor one student.

Have a great day!

Thank you,

All,

Just want to make sure that I'm clear that we can only accept projects
where we have at least 2 mentors. As of now, we can only accept 1 project
(thanks to Giri's generous offer to help). If you're willing to help out,
please let me know.

Thanks,
John

Hello All,

It was nice to hear from you again, John. I was very ecstatic when I found
out that my proposal got accepted! I am grateful to John for helping me out
with my proposal and the AppSensor community for giving me this opportunity
to work on this project. I will do my best to complete it.

I would like to get to know my mentors during this community bonding period
as suggested (even John whom I have communicated with before this). :D I
will start working on some more research with regards to the approach in my
proposal to be able to get a more detail project plan. I will definitely
reach out if I need help.

My Skype ID is timothy910826 if you all would like to use Skype to keep in
touch with me. I could create a Slack group for me and the mentors as an
option for communication during the GSoC period.

Best Regards,
Tim

Sure that sounds good. If you'd like, you can use the OWASP slack (
https://owasp.slack.com) and create a channel there. We'll also likely
communicate over skype as well.

Thanks,
John

All,

Hadn't noticed the full list had been added to this email, sorry.

However, let me take this opportunity to announce that we have 1 student
(Tim) who has been selected for appsensor in our GSoC program participation
this year. His project is "Machine Learning Trend Monitoring Analysis
Engine". This is definitely a _challenging_ project, but something that
users have been requesting for over a year now, particularly as event
streaming for large data sets has become more and more popular as a
development paradigm. We're very excited to see the work we can accomplish
over the summer.

Juan and Giri have graciously agreed to co-mentor with me. If anyone else
would like to contribute to the process, certainly feel free to chime in,
either on this list or to me directly. It would be particularly great to
have contributors who have skillsets with modern data storage tools
(column-oriented dbs, time series dbs, etc.), streaming tech (spark, samza,
etc.), and queuing systems (kafka, mq systems, etc.). The technology stack
is not set in stone, and will be fleshed out over ~ the next month, so now
is the time to speak up if you have opinions.

Side note: you can expect to see a bit more traffic this summer related to
this project - exciting times ahead!

Thanks,
John

*tools (column-oriented dbs, time series dbs, etc.),*
John,

While we are on this topic, I am working on a proof-of-concept for another
project using InfluxDB (time series db), which I feel might be good choice,
because AppSensor data is a time series data.

https://influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/

Thank you,
Giri

Thanks Giri. That is a great suggestion. I'm actually working on a new
influxdb storage provider for appsensor right now. Tim actually already has
influxdb as a possible solution in his proposal, so I'm guessing it's an
option we'll look very closely at.

Thanks,
John
