&gt;<i> I haven't collected the full POST request, but the only header we care about
</I>&gt;<i> is the one you specified ('X-Appsensor-Client-Application-Name' is the
</I>&gt;<i> default, but you can change this via configuration).
</I>
That's fine, noted.


&gt;<i> As for the multiple hosts question, I am simply assuming that application is
</I>&gt;<i> the level of granularity you care about. The system is flexible enough to
</I>&gt;<i> support multiple hosts, but you would handle it using application name
</I>&gt;<i> suffixing as you mentioned above. The only thing you'd want to do there is
</I>&gt;<i> ensure that you add all your hosts for a given application to a correlation
</I>&gt;<i> set so that end users are considered the same across &quot;client applications&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> in this case hosts of a single client application.
</I>
That's a really important thought, and I have added it into the draft
guide in the section we have about architecture.


&gt;<i> Regarding attacks and responses ... I don't have the JSON handy (in the
</I>&gt;<i> middle of a machine rebuild), but ...
</I>
No worries / good luck.


&gt;<i> - The request for attacks would look the same, except to '/attacks'
</I>&gt;<i> - The request for responses would be a 'GET' request to
</I>&gt;<i> '/responses?earliest=12345' where the query parameter 'earliest' is a unix
</I>&gt;<i> timestamp that represents the &quot;start time&quot; to retrieve responses from. If
</I>&gt;<i> you sent a timestamp of 5 minutes ago, you would get the responses created
</I>&gt;<i> in the last 5 minutes. It's a simple polling mechanism and the client will
</I>&gt;<i> simply update that timestamp after every successful call. That way they only
</I>&gt;<i> pull the responses they haven't retrieved yet.
</I>
Thanks. I have added some notes about this in the short write-up about
AppSensor WS. It's just draft text, so can be corrected later.


&gt;<i> We are not doing identity authentication or message integrity checking. The
</I>&gt;<i> basic assumption I'm working from at this point (after talking with Kevin
</I>&gt;<i> Wall a good bit on this topic) is that we'll just rely on web servers to do
</I>&gt;<i> authentication, then pass the client name header through and then we'll do
</I>&gt;<i> authorization. By using the reverse proxy setup, we save ourselves a good
</I>&gt;<i> bit of effort and give users a lot of deployment flexibility.
</I>
Noted, and I have added some wording around that to the guide.

Thanks....

Colin
