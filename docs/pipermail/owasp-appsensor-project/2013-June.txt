All

We have been working on a draft of a new version of the AppSensor
Guide and it is getting to the stage where we have a good structure
based on that identified in the 2011 summit, and a large amount of
content. I have drafted text and Dennis Groves is reviewing and adding
more content.  John Melton and Jay Reynold's glossary has been
incorporated. Rauf Butt's text on the web services version has been
added. Text has been acquired from Michael Coates' original book and
from the wiki. And, text has been taken from other mailing list posts
and discussions at events.

We would like to have a version of the book available to promote at
the next OWASP AppSec global conferences, the first of which is in
Hamburg in August.

This may mean the book is released as say v1.9 instead of v2.0, so we
can continue to add more content over the next few months.
Subsequently once we have a "complete" v2, we can also take the step
of converting into a more accessible, and more easily to contribute,
e-book format. This can then be used for a living v2.x version.

But for the moment, I would like to ask for people with time to review
the draft book to date, and also to see if they can extend or fill in
other parts? This will require effort over the next 4-5 weeks. The
book is currently being written in Word .DOC format, but ultimately
will be converted into other formats. Please let me know if you can
help.

The current contents list is reproduced below, but this is still
subject to your ideas and input.

Best regards

Colin

For what it is worth, I use the same list of names in my slides - please 
inform me as well if you are missing from the list.

Thanks for spinning this up Colin.

In February, there was a discussion on this list about .Net:

   https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-appsensor-project/2013-February/000488.html

I wondered if there is any code we can point to from the new AppSensor
book being worked on?

Colin

Colin has uploaded the zip file containing my .Net port to
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:AppSensor_Core_-_dotNet.zip

I basically took the Java version and did my best to port it to .Net. It
does Build but I very quickly realised that the design didn't work for my
system since it is largely user-centric in that the actions mostly relate
to blocking/choking a user whereas in my system, the main threats are from
anonymous users. For this reason, although it did seem to work for my
limited testing, I cannot guarantee that everything will behave as expected
so if someone wants to use it and write some unit tests etc then you are
most welcome.

I really like the idea of AppSensor though. In my case, as in others, the
most informed intrusion detection can only take place at application level.

happy coding!

Luke
