Congrats - that's awesome! I'm sure the output of that work will be
fantastic. Looking forward to seeing it.

Thanks. I'm feeling we will need a few pages in the v2 book about
"using O2 to dynamically add AppSensor capabilities into .Net code".

Hi, I really like AppSensor and the way it provides application aware ID. I
have downloaded the code and ported it to .Net to try and use it in a
project of my own.
One of the main difficulties I now have is that the system seems to assume
that most intrusion will occur under the context of a user. For instance,
the AttackDetectorUtils.verifyValidRequestMethod will throw an
AppSensorException if the request type is not correct (GET, POST etc) but
this exception is interpreted as a user exception in
DefaultIntrusionStore.addExceptionToIntrusionStore which therefore calls
getIntrusionRecordForCurrentUser which in my case crashes because there is
no current user in the page I have added this check to.

Obviously I could create my own intrusion store class but it seems a rather
bold assumption for the system and whether ideally the exception class
could have a property that records whether the current user exists or
perhaps whether the method verifyValidRequestMethod (and others) should
take an argument to dictate whether the current user is null (and therefore
create AppSensorSystemException instead) or something else.

Has this issue been raised before and do you have any advice or plans to
address this in a smoother way?

Thanks

Luke

Luke,
Great question. The point you bring up is, in my experience, a common one.
Part of deciding where to place your detection points requires determining
whether they should account for logged in users, anonymous (system) users,
or both. In general my approach is to:
1. prefer tracking exceptions by user when possible (most granular) - works
in authenticated-only sections of the app
2. give the option of both in places where the user may or may not be
logged in ... but use the preference of user tracking - works in all
locations
3. use system user exceptions in cases where the action is not
user-specific or it should be tracked across the whole system, not per-user.

Hope this helps.

Thanks,
John

Hey Luke, great stuff

Where is the code of your .Net port?

A good idea might be to create some pseudo-user, say "<anonymous>", that
the user elements throughout AppSensor defaults to, but gets replaced by
the actual user name if a user has authenticated. I believe that something
similar was done in ESAPI. That should at least prevent NPEs.

It is not finished yet, I still need to get the configuration code working
for all the AppSensor options but once it is done, I am happy to upload it
to somewhere for others to use and abuse.

Cheers

Nice, one question: how are you handling the data collected?

I have started playing with Google Analytics to store events/user data, and
it has lots of potential :)

Extending Kevin's pseudo-user concept - I like the idea but how do you
separate each "anonymous" user from each other?  I know that it is not
ideal, but the app can still use other methods to identify each client
using the following pre-auth intel:

1) IP Address
2) Request Header data (Header ordering, User-Agent value, etc..)
3) Client devide fingerprinting using Javascript (which adds a new cookie
hash value)

The point is that even before authentication, without an app-user
identified, you should still be able to track events for each "client" and
initiate response actions.

We fortunately (or overall unfortunately IMHO, but fortunately in this case)
an HTTP session should be associated with this (as per the Java Servlet
Spec)...even before authentication. [And yes, I think this is really dumb and
Jeff Williams spent a lot of time trying to convince them of that, but they
more or less stuck their fingers in their ears and stated "la, la, la; we can't
hear you!". Sigh.] So you should just be able to obtain the session id
for most of the cases and use it. (It may or may not change once the user
authenticates.) Of course, if someone is trying to manipulate the session
id prior to authenticating, you may need an alternate strategy. Better
User-Agent,
and remote IP address (and possibly X-Forwarded for), one could narrow it down
a bit. But that is never fool-proof. I'm not sure anything really ever
is; certainly
username / password is not (phishing, etc.). But we don't need to be perfect,
just good enough to make some reasonable statistical correlations. If we should
happen to disconnect the wrong unauthenticated user, it's not like we are
knocking them off life support. (I'm hoping that life support would require
appropriate authorization; otherwise, it's game over--quite literally. :-)

Oh no, I'd better take that case study about a heart pace-maker out
the draft v2 book!

I have scooped up some guidance from this discussion for the book,
which of course everyone will be able to review and comments on...

John, Rauf, Kevin and Michael

Just scribbling some more draft text for the v2 book. Apart from the
new web services version, the book is probably going to reference
other "example implementations", and thus the existing /old Java
version. People might want to use different
languages/methods/architectures, so I think we ought to keep them all
available. The links that seem to be Java version are currently:

 ?	Code repository
	http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/
?	Getting Started Guide
	https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_GettingStarted
?	Developer Guide
	https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_Developer_Guide

Wiki pages can be created freely, but I was wondering what the plans
are for source code?

- Will the URL code.google.com/p/appsensor/ change for the 2010 Java version?
- Where will the new web services' code be?
- Where might we put other future code examples?
- How will they be differentiated?
- Do we have preferred names for the previous and new versions (e.g.
Integrated Java implementation, and SOAP Web Services)?

It doesn't have to decided now, but I am hoping we don't lose
older/other versions. I'm just flagging the issue up.

IIRC, there was some discussion about eventually moving from Subversion
to Git, because it's supposedly much easier to manage branches and merging
back to the trunk with Git.  I don't recall where we left that conversation
at. I
know there was concern of looking the version history if we moved.  Google
Code now is supporting Git, so I don't think it's necessary to move to
GitHub
to do this.At least Google Code hasn't recently had any (public) security
breaches.
Anyhow, I still think that's open to debate as to whether we move and where
to.
I've not really given it any more attention since GSoC 2012 ended.

See above.

Presently, it seems to be on 2 AppSensor branches. I'm not sure if John has
merged any of it to the trunk yet or not. But see:
<http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fgsoc2012
>
and
<
http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fgsoc2012%20--username%20raufbutt%40gmail.com
>

I would suggest creating a "contrib' subdirectory and perhaps put them
there. Chris Schmidt did that for ESAPI Java. E.g., see:
<http://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-java/source/browse/#svn%2Fcontrib>

- How will they be differentiated?
>

I think that they clearly should be kept separately from AppSensor proper.
The
bigger question IMO is how do we manage who can upload what examples. I'm
personally not comfortable with just giving commit privs to anyone who wants
to upload an example. Until it becomes unmanageable, I think a few of us
should vet the examples and perhaps take responsibility of uploading them.
If it becomes a lot of work because many are submitting examples, then we
might have to create a separate project for it and allow the contributors to
have commit priv there.  But to start off with, I think it's sufficient to
just
make a 'contrib' subdirectory similar to how we did for ESAPI.

create a REST based web service and treat it separately, perhaps
AppSensor-SOAP-WS and AppSensor-REST-WS. If course if we do
that, we should probably refactor things to break out the common
components into a common core (AppSensor-Core?).

I agree that we don't want to lose the version history. There are ways
and tools to support moving from svn to git or svn to hg (Mercurial),
but I just don't think it's been on anyone's immediate radar.

BTW, as far as additional documentation is concerned, don't forget that
the AppSensor GSoC work is documented on the AppSensor Google
Code wiki. Specifically, <http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/wiki/GSoC2012>.
There's not a lot there--it's mostly status updates--but you might find
something
useful there.

I am one of the Administrators of the Github OWASP repository - please 
let me know what we require to move app sensor over to github. After all 
git makes community collaboration more democratic and free than any tool 
before it. :-)

Lets make AppSensor an first class example of how to do 'community' - 
from documentation, development and even reference implementations - 
lets make sure AppSensor is available to everybody!

Hi Colin, thanks for your email.

I agree mostly with what Kevin suggested. I think we should have a separate
branch for the code examples of the technologies other than JAVA. Hence, a
separate branch for AppSensor web services. If I remember correctly, this
is what John and Kevin indicated during the GSoC 2012 as well.

Regards,
Rauf

Kevin is right on all accounts. My plan for going forward was to use git,
though I hadn't decided on googlecode vs. github. I did create a github
acct. to reserve my username since it seems that's a really active and
engaged community (rails security issues aside :>)

As for the project names, my plan was something similar to what Kevin
suggested. It would probably end up being:
appsensor-core
appsensor-ws-soap
appsensor-ws-rest

Very similar to Kevin's version, but I think that was the most recent
version of the naming convention.

Thanks,
John

Kevin, Rauf and John

Thanks very much. I'll use the suggested names until they are
confirmed otherwise. The idea of a controlled contrib sub-directory.
And lastly, thanks for the additional links.

I'll update the draft book text as I can, but make a note to verify
these again whenever we go for release of the book.

On Wednesday I saw an email from the UK Cybersecurity Challenge
company that runs competitions to raise awareness of cyber learning
opportunities and careers. They have entered the ESET CyberSmart
Awards "to recognise individuals and organisations up and down the UK
that are working on projects to keep people secure online". I thought
if they can do it, so can we.

I proposed in the submission that educating software developers about
defending their applications is as useful (as training users) to
protect citizens of all sorts (not just children and young people).

Most of the other entries are local initiatives by schools to help

It is more of a national thing.  The entries are grouped per region.
As my office is based in Northumberland, I selected North East. I have
explained in a subsequent email that AppSensor is actually more of a
virtual project without any particular physical location and that
volunteer contributors are from around the UK and further afield. The
entries will be assessed in this manner:

   "Twelve regional entrants from around the country will be
shortlisted by a public vote,
    with the overall winner being decided by our prestigious panel of
judges below. There?s
    a ?5,000 grant for the deserving winner, as well as ?500 funding
for second and third prizes."

So far, there are no other entries in the North East. But please do vote!

   Entry: AppSensor

   Entry rules
   http://cybersmartawards.org/official-competition-rules/

Watch you don't submit that "click to vote" button more than once, as
we don't want to have the entry withdrawn. I can't see anything in the
rules about who/what is allowed to vote.

Even if we don't get any further, it is awareness anyway.

On Wednesday I saw an email from the UK Cybersecurity Challenge
company that runs competitions to raise awareness of cyber learning
opportunities and careers. They have entered the ESET CyberSmart
Awards "to recognise individuals and organisations up and down the UK
that are working on projects to keep people secure online". I thought
if they can do it, so can we.

I proposed in the submission that educating software developers about
defending their applications is as useful (as training users) to
protect citizens of all sorts (not just children and young people).

Most of the other entries are local initiatives by schools to help
parents and children, but the Cybersecurity Challenge's entry isn't.

Voted.

I like the idea and I agree with Colin that this exercise will atleast
create awareness and may bring spotlight to AppSensor.

Ryan et al

I'm not sure the discussion of your ideas were adequately concluded
here. There has also been discussion on the OWASP Top Ten list about
application DoS. I wondered if we either need to add some examples to:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_DetectionPoints#UserTrendException.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_DetectionPoints#SystemTrendException

and/or make some changes like the "timing" DP mentioned below? Does
anyone have thoughts on these?

[I did not complete my XML file as I found documenting all the
inter-relationships too time-consuming, and did not fully understand
the XML model used for CVE and its various views. So for now, I have
been adding information into the main DP page on the wiki]

Could an OE detection point detect HTTP Response Splitting?
Or be used as a crude DLP (similar to your proposed OE2, but
the "abnormal quantity" may only be 1)?

That would be sweet.

Exactly.  That is the concept that is used in many WAFs when inspecting
outbound data.  It can track where and the amount of sensitive data in the
app.  For instance if a certain page on a site displays 1 SSN to a user
when logged into their account and then suddenly 500 are shown (as a
result of a successful SQLi), then an alert should be triggered.

<shameless plug time>
I cover a bunch of these detection point concepts in Chapter 6 of my book
