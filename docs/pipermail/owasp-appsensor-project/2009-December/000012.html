<PRE>Colin,

This looks really good. I really like how it draws together the
different &quot;defense&quot; components and shows how the network firewall, WAF,
db and xml firewalls and AppSensor all come together. 

I did get confused at first by the P&amp;ID format, but that's only because
I haven't looked at one before.  After a few minutes I got it figured
out.

Would you like to post this document on the AppSensor page of OWASP?

Regarding ESAPI errors, I agree it may be a good idea to add the digital
signature and availability errors. I had trouble thinking of a scenario
where you would fire an output encoding error. 

Thanks,
Michael

I was meaning to try to draw a digram of AppSensor with a few of the
suggested additions.  I've done one (attached) in the style of a piping
and instrumentation diagram (P&amp;ID).  So 'valves' are used for prevention
measures on inputs/outputs to throttle or stop data.  I
included:

- FF CSP
- Network firewall
- WAF (request and response monitoring/protection)
- Database firewall
- XML firewall

and some of the suggestions about input feeds such as NAP data, Http:BL,
Tor exit bodes, GSB DB and list of common usernames.  I can't think how
to display insertion of fake parameters and detection of tampering, but
perhaps input validation covers that?  The example &quot;architecture&quot; could
also include network IDS/IPS and other client side measures such as
anti-malware/anti-phishing measures, and a lot more probably.

I indicated the AppSensor Controller (pale blue bits on the diagram) as
modifying requests (e.g. banning traffic from a particular IP) and also
feeding back into the application logic/code.

I also had a read of the error types in ESAPI and wondered if any extra
sensors are required for:

- cryptography/digital certificate errors
- output validation
- availability errors

Anyway, not sure how useful the diagram is, but thought I'd send it
over. Suggestions and feedback (including &quot;throw it in the bin&quot;)
welcome.

Colin
