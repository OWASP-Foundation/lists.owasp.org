<PRE>All,

 

I thought I'd send out an update to the AppSensor mailing list.  Here's
a bit of a rundown of what's been going on recently.

 

-          AppSensor presented at OWASP AppSec DC

o   presentation link:
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/images/0/06/Defend_Yourself-Integrating_Real_Time_D">http://www.owasp.org/images/0/06/Defend_Yourself-Integrating_Real_Time_D</A>
efenses_into_Online_Applications-Michael_Coates.pdf

-          Next version of AppSensor book is underway. I've got some new
detection points to include (thanks Alex, Collin and others) and also
want to expand the architecture sections

-          The OWASP AppSensor page has been reformatted with tabs.
Hopefully it's a bit more usable

o    <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSensor_Project">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSensor_Project</A>

-          The AppSensor Demo code is now running and available for all
to test!

o   This just went up the other day, something is due to break soon. We
shall see.

o   Check it out and provide feedback: <A HREF="http://defendtheapp.com/">http://defendtheapp.com/</A>

-          All source is going to be at google code soon. The page is :
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/">http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/</A> Nothing there yet.

-          OWASP Top 10 book.  AppSensor will be featured in the section
&quot;What's on the Horizon&quot; . AppSensor won't be in the top 10 itself, but
the concept of detecting attacks and preventing automated scripting will
be discussed as something that is coming down the pipe.

 

Volunteers?

 

I'm looking for volunteers if anyone wants to get involved.  I'd really
like to get together a nice one page info sheet similar to what ASVS has
here <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/images/4/41/ASVS_One_Page_Handout.pdf">http://www.owasp.org/images/4/41/ASVS_One_Page_Handout.pdf</A>

 

Also, I'm going to suggest a few changes to ESAPI intrusion detection
based on the demo app. Is anyone working with ESAPI and would like to
discuss the proposed changes?

 

And if anyone is interested in helping make any of the above items
better, then by all means, please speak up.

 

 

Thanks!

 

Michael Coates
