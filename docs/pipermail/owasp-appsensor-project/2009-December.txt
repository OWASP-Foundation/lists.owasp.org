All,

 

I thought I'd send out an update to the AppSensor mailing list.  Here's
a bit of a rundown of what's been going on recently.

 

-          AppSensor presented at OWASP AppSec DC

o   presentation link:
http://www.owasp.org/images/0/06/Defend_Yourself-Integrating_Real_Time_D
efenses_into_Online_Applications-Michael_Coates.pdf

-          Next version of AppSensor book is underway. I've got some new
detection points to include (thanks Alex, Collin and others) and also
want to expand the architecture sections

-          The OWASP AppSensor page has been reformatted with tabs.
Hopefully it's a bit more usable

o    http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSensor_Project

-          The AppSensor Demo code is now running and available for all
to test!

o   This just went up the other day, something is due to break soon. We
shall see.

o   Check it out and provide feedback: http://defendtheapp.com/

-          All source is going to be at google code soon. The page is :
http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/ Nothing there yet.

-          OWASP Top 10 book.  AppSensor will be featured in the section
"What's on the Horizon" . AppSensor won't be in the top 10 itself, but
the concept of detecting attacks and preventing automated scripting will
be discussed as something that is coming down the pipe.

 

Volunteers?

 

I'm looking for volunteers if anyone wants to get involved.  I'd really
like to get together a nice one page info sheet similar to what ASVS has
here http://www.owasp.org/images/4/41/ASVS_One_Page_Handout.pdf

 

Also, I'm going to suggest a few changes to ESAPI intrusion detection
based on the demo app. Is anyone working with ESAPI and would like to
discuss the proposed changes?

 

And if anyone is interested in helping make any of the above items
better, then by all means, please speak up.

 

 

Thanks!

 

Michael Coates

I was meaning to try to draw a digram of AppSensor with a few of the
suggested additions.  I've done one (attached) in the style of a
piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID).  So 'valves' are used for
prevention measures on inputs/outputs to throttle or stop data.  I
included:

- FF CSP
- Network firewall
- WAF (request and response monitoring/protection)
- Database firewall
- XML firewall

and some of the suggestions about input feeds such as NAP data,
Http:BL, Tor exit bodes, GSB DB and list of common usernames.  I can't
think how to display insertion of fake parameters and detection of
tampering, but perhaps input validation covers that?  The example
"architecture" could also include network IDS/IPS and other client
side measures such as anti-malware/anti-phishing measures, and a lot
more probably.

I indicated the AppSensor Controller (pale blue bits on the diagram)
as modifying requests (e.g. banning traffic from a particular IP) and
also feeding back into the application logic/code.

I also had a read of the error types in ESAPI and wondered if any
extra sensors are required for:

- cryptography/digital certificate errors
- output validation
- availability errors

Anyway, not sure how useful the diagram is, but thought I'd send it
over. Suggestions and feedback (including "throw it in the bin")
welcome.

Hello All,


The slides from the OWASP Logging Project presentation at IBWAS09 have been
uploaded to the project's main page at:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Logging_Project

Please send me your comments/remarks.


There are definitely shared objectives between the Logging and the AppSensor
projects; as you can see from the slides, in the Logging Project we are
mostly dealing with integrating application events into a SIM (demo using
OSSIM).

In any case, I'd like to help the AppSensor in any way I can.

Michael, thanks for the updates, it looks great!


Thanks,
Marc Chisinevski

Colin,

This looks really good. I really like how it draws together the
different "defense" components and shows how the network firewall, WAF,
db and xml firewalls and AppSensor all come together. 

I did get confused at first by the P&ID format, but that's only because
I haven't looked at one before.  After a few minutes I got it figured
out.

Would you like to post this document on the AppSensor page of OWASP?

Regarding ESAPI errors, I agree it may be a good idea to add the digital
signature and availability errors. I had trouble thinking of a scenario
where you would fire an output encoding error. 

Thanks,
Michael

Yes, perhaps a P&ID format isn't the best way, nor most familiar, but
I'll add a few notes to an updated version, and correct a few
inconsistencies that I have noted.  I liked the way it encourages you
to think of the web application within the whole environment.

I couldn't think of anything else for the "box of circles" in the
application code.

> Would you like to post this document on the AppSensor page of OWASP?

The updated (2-page) file is now here:

Schematic arrangement of example sensors, in the style of a process
piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID)
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Appsensor-pid.pdf

if you want to link it in how you think best.

I meant to include this URL where the errors are listed (documentation
for Java version) for readers of the list:

http://owasp-esapi-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk_doc/2.0-rc4/index.html
click on org.owasp.esapi.errors in packages

I wonder if an output encoding error example might be... data stored
with incorrect encoding, or embedded injection, that is then published
by the site as a web service, or RSS feed.

Colin
