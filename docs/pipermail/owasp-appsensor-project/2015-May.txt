Sharing this as I think there might be interest in this project since it's
got a lot of similarities to appsensor:

Message-ID: <CAM8z=yJYiagTCb3nSrVAWMkxyTHQH+=yxEaDy1hMj6FC9MA8hA@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Colin is running a couple of sessions at appsec eu related to appsensor.
The first is on Tuesday (5/19) for documentation updates. The second is the
reason for this email.

The actual session is Wednesday (5/20) from 13:30 - 17:00 local time
(Amsterdam, NL). (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Project_Summit_2015/Home#13:30_.E2.80.93_17:00_AppSensor_.28Code.29_.E2.80.93_Dashboard
)

The expectation of the session is: "... [design of] a reporting dashboard.
This session is to brainstorm ideas and layouts for the dashboard, and
identify what tools/libraries can assist in the creation of the dashboard.
Bring ideas, energy, URLs, paper and pens! The outputs will be dashboard
mockups."

In preparation for this meeting, we'd like to give everyone an opportunity
for early input. Specifically, we are looking for:

- who are the target audience(s) for the dashboard?
- what are the use cases that need to be handled? ops room view, attack
research, etc.
- what is the "normal state" - nothing on the screen at all???
- what is usefully displayed?
- what sort of patterns would a typical attack look like, and how would
visualisation help highlight this?
- what drill down/view might be useful?
- what do you want to be there for sure?
- what do you NOT want to be there for sure?
- sample tools/views you find helpful?
- any UI patterns we should use / not use?

These questions are just examples to get you thinking. ANY and ALL input is
valuable.

Let me be clear - *THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO INFLUENCE THE UI ! *Feedback /
input is critical at this point. This will be the main development effort
for the next couple of months, so input now is crucial to building
something useful.

We're also considering holding a phone call this week or early next if
people would find that useful as a way to provide input. Please let me or
Colin know if you'd be interested in joining a call, and if there's
interest, we'll set it up.

Thanks,
John

I would like to see:

An overall status (could be a gauge or speedometer or whatever) showing the current amount of sensor activity.
The ability to click any sensor current and see historic activity (charts)
The ability to click an ip or session and see events (sensors triggered, actions taken etc.)
Geographic IP info.
Not sure if this is within scope, but list currently blocked ips. Ability to block/unblock and whitelist (while running pentests) IPs.

Erlend,

Thanks for the good feedback. All of these will be added to the list.

I just wanted to briefly comment on your last point. The idea of appsensor
has been to have the "responses" be automatically generated, but your
comment implies a manual override, or at least response termination. This
is an area that will include some work in the backend as well as the UI. I
think it's valuable, but it wasn't originally designed in, so we'll have to
add support for that functionality while we're exposing a UI to use it.
Great idea!

Thanks,
John

>- who are the target audience(s) for the dashboard?
People in operations who are running infrastructure that the application is
hosted on.


>- what are the use cases that need to be handled? ops room view, attack
research, etc.
Attack research, ops rooms. Would also be nice to see appsensor used
BlueTeam vs Red Team CTF competitions , could be used by the Blue Teams.
Would be a good place to put Appsensor to the test. Would be cool to use
AppSensor to monitor an app running in a competition like this:
http://www.echothrust.com/blogs/du-selects-echothrust-solutions-its-first-hacking-competition-dubai

>- what is the "normal state" - nothing on the screen at all???
Normal traffic, no anomalies in log data.

- what is usefully displayed?
- what sort of patterns would a typical attack look like, and how would
visualisation help highlight this?
>- what drill down/view might be useful?
Would be interesting and helpful to see information especially at the
enumeration stage of an attack. Also would be interesting to see traffic
coming from blacklisted IP's.

- what do you want to be there for sure?
- what do you NOT want to be there for sure?
- sample tools/views you find helpful?
>- any UI patterns we should use / not use?
Not sure what is meant by this question. But I'd like to see us something
like Elasticsearch+Logstash+Kibana. I'm still figuring out myself how to
use this "ELK" stack which can make really nice looking dashboards like
these:
https://www.elastic.co/blog/kibana-4-for-investigating-pacs-super-pacs-and-your-neighbors
and check this link:
https://www.elastic.co/blog/kibana-4-beta-3-now-more-filtery/


I'm going to try attend both sessions.  I will be in Amsterdam. Looking
forward to meeting all of you smart people.

Regards.
Timo

Hi guys I just want to start preparing a bit for the dashboard workshop at
the project summit.
Is there a sample app we can setup without much effort that uses appsensor
and if possible has anyone set this up and collected some sample log data
that we can use to come up with a dashboard.

Regards.
Timo

Timo

I don't have a suitable sample application, but I have appended below
some fake data I created for my dashboard demos in 2011. The type of
log data will be dependent upon the types of sensors, how carefully
they have been designed, the application functionality, etc. All good
things to think about and discuss.

This data example doesn't reflect how the v2 reference implementation
works. For example every event here has both a detection point type
AND a response action type.

Coming up with some imaginary data for different scenarios would be
helpful. That could be purely descriptive, or fake delimited event
data.

Regards

Colin

Thanks Colin - helpful data.

Timo, I attached to this email an example of the JSON produced by the
reference implementation. There is 1 example each of [event, attack,
response] that I generated using the unit tests in the codebase. With that,
I generated a JSON schema for each as well. That should give a starting
point for data. I don't have a log of output anywhere.

As for sample apps, there are a couple of simple examples for both REST (
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/tree/master/sample-apps/sample-appsensor-ws-rest-server)
and SOAP (
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/tree/master/sample-apps/sample-appsensor-ws-soap-server).
This readme doc should get you setup if you want to try them out:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/blob/master/sample-apps/README.md. If
you have issues, let me know.

Thanks,
John

There is 1 example each of [event, attack, response] that I generated using the unit tests in the codebase. With that, I generated a JSON schema for each as well. That should give a starting point for data. I don't have a log of output anywhere.

This readme doc should get you setup if you want to try them out: https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/blob/master/sample-apps/README.md. If you have issues, let me know.

Ok, waited a few days. Here were my original notes which are a bit of a
brain dump:

- who are the target audience(s) for the dashboard?
    - operations, developers
- what are the use cases that need to be handled? ops room view, attack
research, etc.
    - dashboard on the wall
    - research on attack(s) in progress

- what is the "normal state" - nothing on the screen at all???
    - same as with "active issues", maybe a message about no data found.
Need to differentiate so we know we're not missing data b/c of a bad
connection. Maybe have a "connected to backend" message displayed somewhere.

- what is usefully displayed?
    - "main" chart of a sliding window (last 5 minutes?), possibly
        - stacked chart with all detection points with sum total
        - something like colin's video of the red/orange/yellow nodes for
each detection point, growing darker the more active they are
        - a bubble chart, bubble per detection point, growing based on
activity (another version of colin's example)
    - some other statistics on the main dashboard:
        - total events over varied recent time ranges (minute, hour, day)
        - scrolling list of recently logged events, attacks, responses
        - most "active" users or IPs
        - avg events/attacks/responses per minute/hour/day, etc. - give
some sort of useful guage to know if "now" is better/worse than usual.

- what sort of patterns would a typical attack look like, and how would
visualisation help highlight this?
    - not sure, need some help from ops folks on this one

- what drill down/view might be useful?
    - by user
        - see data charted over a sliding window of time (default to last
hour?)
        - see what client applications saw this user
        - see a thread of activity (timeline) showing what the user's been
seen doing when
    - by detection point (label - ie. specific detection point)
        - see data charted over a sliding window of time (default to last
hour?)
        - group by client application (20 total, 2 on app A, 18 on app B, 0
on C/D/E)
    - (not for v1) - by metadata
        - if a developer defines custom metadata, we could allow grouping
on some key name - might be useful in custom situations
    - configuration editor
        - need a UI to expose the configuration for detection points and
their associated responses (need admin role)
        - need a serializer/deserializer for save/read

- what do you want to be there for sure?
    - simple, understandable, useful visualizations
    - config editor

- what do you NOT want to be there for sure?
    - too much on the screen
    - the wrong visualizations

- sample tools/views you find helpful?
    - charts using some library ???
    - would like to use websockets - need to beef up support
    - backend likely spring boot / spring security
    - bootstrap
    - jquery
    - not sure about javascript frameworks ... need help :>
    -
https://dribbble.com/shots/1315388-Dashboard-Web-App-UI-Job-Summary/attachments/184703
    - http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin/
    - https://www.almsaeedstudio.com/preview
    -
http://elijahpaul.co.uk/monitoring-pfsense-2-1-logs-using-elk-logstash-kibana-elasticsearch/

- any UI patterns we should use / not use?
    - relying on bootstrap
    - no pie charts :>

Thanks,
John

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] 2.1.0-RC1 released
Message-ID: <CAM8z=yJ1bxfAv-NtPQkt_wcdc_OQcUk0B4qv_dQz7AM1_3dt6Q@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I just released 2.1.0-RC1. This is the first release candidate for 2.1.0.
More info is here:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/releases/tag/v2.1.0-RC1

There are a number of updates in this release, with the bulk of them
consisting of integrations. The specifics are here:
https://github.com/jtmelton/appsensor/blob/dev-v2.1/changelog.txt

Pending any significant issues, I plan on one more release candidate,
followed by a final release in mid-late June.

As always, happy to hear any feedback.

Thanks,
John

This looks great. Do you think the word "most common vulnerabilities"
in the sub-title should be "greatest risks", like in the OTT now?

You can't include every project. Of course it might be nice to mention
Cornucopia in a sentence with the SCPQRG, as the attacks on the cards
come directly from that. So maybe in #4 after the ASVS sentence....

   "The OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide provides a
short form list of many
    web security requirements; this is also available in the form of a
card game called OWASP Cornucopia."

In #5, could you capitalise the S in "Appsensor", and change "for your
site" to "within your application"

   "AppSensor: Intrusion detection within your application."

Thanks!

Colin

I have aggregated these comments, and added my own, at:

   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ez7JBp7xEueFgMtOhEvAeVFcKR4jcgil-PxT6Rxieps/edit?usp=sharing

When I develop, I quite like the flexibility of laying things out as I
go. I like to see the output and can't design it all in advance. So
I'd be happy to comment on mocks/screenshots of work in progress if
that would help further.

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] AppSensor at AppSecEU
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBk=35DzubY0LMoyDZimLoHbS9VCYtA+9a0NNh3vM7S=4g@mail.gmail.com>

We had a few things happening at AppSec EU in Amsterdam last week.
Here's my report:


Project summit
===========

1. Documentation

Timo joined me to review some of the later chapters in the AppSensor
Guide 2.0.1. That work is still ongoing, but I have also started
making the changes identified previously for v2.0.2. WE did make some
progress.

2. Dashboard design

John attempted to join the session remotely, but no-one else attended.
The ideas sent by email, and my ow, have been aggregated here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ez7JBp7xEueFgMtOhEvAeVFcKR4jcgil-PxT6Rxieps/edit?usp=sharing


Delegate bags
===========

The Intro for Developers leaflet was included within every delegate's
bag (500 of them). I have no information on whether that was useful. I
suppose we will see if there is an increase in microsite visits, or
usage of AppSensor.


CISO track
========

Tobias kindly agreed for me to hand out copies of the CISO Briefing to
each attendee of his first talk in the CISO track. I handed out about
50 copies. The audience targeting was good. I didn't receive any
particular feedback. Some extra copies were left on the OWASP booth as
a free take-away.


Other
=====

I also had 20 copies of the AppSensor Guide, and gave these away to
various people when I got talking to them about AppSensor.

I noted a couple of new vendor products that use similar ideas. One
for instrumenting code, and one for detecting changes to the DOM.

There was no AppSensor presentation in any track, or training.


Hopefully we can do some similar initiatives at AppSec USA in San
Francisco this September.

Regards

Colin

Hi Colin

Thank you for putting this together. I'll be working on an articles for the
connector with a slink to more details regarding the summit and this
information is very valuable.

I'll need to ask the board if we could do a summit during app sec US, keep
you posted

regards

Johanna

Thanks Colin.

Yes, I'm not a UX designer, so I'll definitely be looking for feedback
frequently. I'll post to this list and the dev list as well looking for
comments and feedback.

Thanks,
John
