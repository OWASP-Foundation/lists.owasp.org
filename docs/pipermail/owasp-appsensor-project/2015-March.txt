Making it easy to print normally, as well as by a commercial printer, makes
a lot of sense. I like your other ideas. I begin to draft something today
and then share it.

Hi,

 

I know I?m a bit late to comment on this but I also think it should be printable and staple-able (is that a word? :) ). About the buzz words list here are a few others that might be useful (or not) :

 

Malicious behavior detection

Proactive security

Application context intelligence

First line security

Scalable

 

I know it is somewhat obvious to us but : ?community driven?, ?open source?, and ?free? might also be important to mention to a CISO that might not know that much.

When John created the text for the developer flyer, and we got feedback on it, that made it really easy for me to do the subsequent design part. At the moment I feel stuck on some fundamental things that everyone on this list could help decide:

1.	The developer flyer is a two-sided A4 or US letter leaflet, which is great for handing out in large quantities

I'd prefer "printer paper" - something standard sized, which I'm guessing is A4 / US Letter. 

*	How many pages - just two or a little booklet say 10 12 or 16 sides

The overview in the guide is about 30 pages. There's some stuff that can be removed, but a significant amount of value remains. While a professional printing/binding is nice, I'd still plan for people who want to print it out and staple it. That can be done double-sided, so I'd say 12-15 pages sounds about right once you strip down the content, add a nice front page, and then account for section/page breaks for printing.

What is the key messaging we want to push? Some buzzy phrase ideas:

Colin / All, 

I liked your idea about the flyers for appsensor and thought the one for developers turned out great. You also mentioned one for CISOs, so wanted to see what you'd like to do there. I can put something together as a starter like I did for the last one, though I'm much less confident in pulling the right material.

Is anyone on list interested in helping either creating this doc and/or reviewing it?

Louis, and everyone else

Not too late at all. I just went through what I did this morning, and added
those messaging phrases into my draft text:


https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1nGw2Qye7HczgbPsnCGyB-h5OgCmKBBxcxmlQqRHjjSk/edit#

Yes, I agree it should both be easily printable by anyone on their own
local printer, but also suitable for posh commercial printing (stitched or
stapled as you say). So I propose:

   - 12 core pages (for paper printing, factors of 4 are better), plus
   front (colour outside and blank inside, 2 pages) and back (blank inside and
   colour outside, 2 pages) covers
      - web PDFs will be 14 pages (outside covers plus 12)
      - hardcopy will be 16 pages (4 cover pages plus 12)

I have pulled most of the draft text from the Guide, and it is not
necessarily in the same order, so it may not flow well and needs some good
review and editing. Maybe the "Benefits" section is too bullety? I think we
need better and more text in the Enterprise ready" part, or could split
this into two sections, each 1 page long? I have suggested we embed lots of
relevant quotations (with sources) as shown indented in grey. These will
break the text up, and attempt to get some of the key messages across via
other people's words. Do you think we need to check if we can use them? I
think they are all public.

   http://janefriedman.com/2012/01/23/permissions/

http://writersrelief.com/blog/2014/01/get-permission-to-use-quotes-in-writing/


I have added some text about Gartner's RASP, because some CISOs may have
heard of it, and it is closely related. Some of their quotes are really
good, even if their defining qualities exclude [source?] code modification.

Although we say this is the CISO briefing, we maybe should also assume it
will be read by industry analysts, CTOs and appsec technologists.

RASP: Runtime Application Self Protection term sure sounds similar
conceptually to AppSensor -
http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/runtime-application-self-protection-rasp.
Have we reached out to any Gartner Analysts to give them an overview of
AppSensor?

Hi Ryan

I don't think we have. And yes we should.

I wonder if it's something we could do something around the time of AppSec
USA? I imagine there are several OWASP people working in companies that are
Gartner clients, we could ask for a referral?

BTW I think Joseph Feiman's original publication of this name was:

   Apr 2012 Runtime Application Self-Protection: A Must-Have, Emerging
Security Technology

https://www.gartner.com/doc/1994816/runtime-application-selfprotection-musthave-emerging

But I found a more recent paper, which has some interesting points:

   Sep 2014 Stop Protecting Your Apps: Its Time for Apps to Protect
Themselves

https://www.gartner.com/doc/2856020/maverick-research-stop-protecting-apps

which is also "free" from the vendor referred to in the SC magazine article:

    http://info.waratek.com/gartner-maverick-research

Someone else's opinion about RASP here:

   AppSec: RASP is Dead in the Water
   http://richard-quinn.com/2014/08/22/appsec-rasp-is-dead-in-the-water/

I put a little suggested text about RASP in the draft AppSensor CISO
Briefing, but maybe that's the wrong thing to do? See other email thread
today.

Colin

Yeah, good find. RASP is probably the best fit for appsensor in gartner
speak. The one major difference is the "runtime" implication. I think the
term is getting overloaded, but at the end of the day, the "runtime" part
is leading people to think the .NET or JVM runtimes (to the exclusion of
languages without a runtime, ie. native code or dynamic languages). There's
nothing in appsensor to prevent any language / runtime from benefitting
from the concepts, so that's where there is a standout difference.

I really like the layout and general flow. It makes a lot of sense to me.
Specific responses inline.

Also, happy to help if you want to open up editing or commenting ability to
me. I'll try to do some work on it this week.

Thanks,
John

Yeah, we can put some of that in a paragraph format (or collapse some
bullets) I think and have it read better, or at least add some padding text.

 This section is tough to me. What do others think should go here? It seems
like integration is the big one, but also correlation,
visibility/intelligence, speed/performance. It's a lot to put into a
section. I'd prefer to keep it as one section with sub-sections for each
area of interest personally.

Yep, I think this section needs at least one more paragraph after the
Gartner RASP quote showing how we're different, and the benefits of our
more wide-ranging view.

Maybe "Intro for Executives" to match "Intro for Developers"?

Sorry, I had meant it to be editable by anyone. I think this works now:


https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nGw2Qye7HczgbPsnCGyB-h5OgCmKBBxcxmlQqRHjjSk/edit?usp=sharing

Comments in line.

I am trying to finish off each section with a quotation, and need to
introduce the gartner RASP thing early since they have some good quotes!

I still think "CISO" is fine, just that we need to ensure it ticks boxes
for a few more rolls too. OWASP has some other CISO-orientated resources so
it fits.

What is your own deadline for your talk?

Yep - looks editable now. My deadline is April 7th I believe, which is a
full month away so I'm not worried about the timeline for now.

I was wondering if we can somehow sum up the difference. This came to mind:

DRAFT: "The RASP product category currently focuses on vendor-offerings,
and as such excludes the greater opportunities available of deeper
integration within applications and enterprise-wide security intelligence
sharing, described and implemented by AppSensor. Organisations can
instrument their own applications and analysis engine, or use existing
event monitoring systems and network security devices, or build upon the
AppSensor reference implementation."

Is that true? Is it fair? Can it be improved?

Colin

That makes sense to me. The only thing I'm not sure of is whether or not
these products do "enterprise-wide intelligence sharing". Not sure if the
products will output their data to standardized data formats. I imagine
they probably can aggregate the data from their own products across an
organization. I'm just not familiar enough with their products.

All,
Unfortunate news here: OWASP was not chosen to be a mentor organization for
2015. There's some discussions underway that may still allow us to fund
some projects - we'll have to see. Either way, this exercise was useful, so
thanks for all the help.
Thanks,
John

John and Ryan

You are correct. I re-read the September article more fully and it does
discuss integration with other network and security devices.

The RASP "criteria" are stated to be:

   - "Be able to protect applications by detecting and blocking attacks.
   - Have deep visibility into application logic flow and data flow,
   configuration, executed instructions and data processing to accurately
   identify attacks.
   - Be instrumented into the application runtime environment. This
   instrumentation should be noninvasive or require no/minimal invasiveness
   into application code."

but goes on to say "However, instrumentation into runtime and degree of
invasiveness in the code might vary." and "An ideal RASP implementation
would be instrumentation of the runtime engine (e.g., an application
server) that leaves the application code untouched, and does not require a
programmer's involvement in security issues.". It goes on to list three
other types of implementation. And for example "WAF can serve as an early
warning system for RASP", as we know, and some of us use.

So overall, I would revise my paragraph to:

DRAFT 2: "RASP is a closely related concept. Gartner's RASP product
category currently focuses predominantly on vendor-offerings, and as such
touches less on the opportunities available of deeper code-level
integration within applications, described and implemented by AppSensor.
Organisations can instrument their own applications and build an analysis
engine, or use existing event monitoring systems and network security
devices, or build upon the AppSensor reference implementation."

Yep - that sounds spot on to me.

I have pasted that paragraph into the draft CISO Briefing text, and the
list of revisions for the Guide.

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] Documentation session at Project Summit
	in Amsterdam, May
Message-ID: <CAAxdBB=CikBMReQ+p1KQTKi1vpwA42b9YztgK-u9j3HuWhDUbw@mail.gmail.com>

The OWASP project summit in Amsterdam is going ahead:

   http://2015.appsec.eu/project-summit/

We have a session on Tuesday 19th to undertake review and update of the Guide:

==============

13:00 ? 15:00 hrs Tuesday 19th May 2015

AppSensor (Documentation) ? Guide Review

The AppSensor Guide v2 was published in May last year, and has had two
minor updates, the last one mainly due to the important release of the
v2 code implementation. This session is to edit and improve the guide,
since many of the chapters have not been fully reviewed. Participants
should read a chapter or two in advance of the summit (chapter 5
onwards, but choose randomly/what is of interest) and bring their
edits/comments to the session, where the guide will be updated. All
participants will be acknowledged in the guide and on the project wiki
page.

? Briefing
? Live editing
? Publication updated PDF.

==============

We also have a code session on the following day (see separate email
about that). Further details:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Project_Summit_2015/Home

Free registration:

   http://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-project-summit-eu-2015-amsterdam-tickets-16029097462?aff=es2&rank=0

I look forward to meeting some of you there.

Dear all

Does anyone else have some time to help review and update this draft
text for the CISO Briefing:

  https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1nGw2Qye7HczgbPsnCGyB-h5OgCmKBBxcxmlQqRHjjSk/edit#heading=h.3cl2ovfkpnal

Pages 8-9 are particularly in need of some love.

Colin

I added this quotation:

   Vendor recommended security controls and compliance requirements leave huge
   gaps in application security? The biggest gap and most pressing need is that
   most monitoring systems do not understand enterprise applications.
To continuously
   monitor enterprise applications you need to collect the appropriate
data and then
   make sense of it.

   Securing Enterprise Applications, Securosis, 2014
   https://securosis.com/mobile/securing-enterprise-applications-new-white-paper/full

The paper has lots of good information about failures in traditional
security vendor approaches.

Louis and anyone else - would you be able to have a read through again
as a review before we crate a designed version?

   https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1nGw2Qye7HczgbPsnCGyB-h5OgCmKBBxcxmlQqRHjjSk/edit#

Thank you in advance.

Colin

Subject: [Owasp-appsensor-project] 2.1.0 branch update
Message-ID: <CAM8z=yKeYqXuzVBbAgPHjjASgYStZ-JJPzbao6LrNy4CXxSnSg@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Just pushed an update (and maven snapshot) to the 2.1 branch.

This push added a couple of integration points:
- JMX notifications
- CEF over syslog

These represent the first steps towards various integration points we'd
like to have included as part of the project. If these are of interest to
you, try them out and let us know how it goes. As always, send me any
questions you might have.

Thanks,
John

Dear all

I have taken the draft text and begun converting into a publishable document:

   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Appsensor-ciso-briefing.pdf

This uses the look and feel of the Guide cover, but using a different
colour to differentiate it. But it also reflects the fonts and
decorative items used in the new Intro for Developers. Still work in
progress....

I will email again once it's a bit more finished and ready for a proof read.

Colin
