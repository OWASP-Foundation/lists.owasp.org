Is this tutorial site still available anywhere?  The home page just
seems to have the demo video on it now.

Regards, Colin

The presentation at ISSA-UK yesterday seemed to be quite well
received.  Neither my company nor OWASP are sponsors of ISSA so I was
speaking as an ISSA member - the slots are normally reserved for
sponsors.  Therefore I had a completely unbranded application, but
fortunately someone in the audience gave me a chance to move onto the
topic of OWASP ESAPI.

One person pointed out that if they could exploit a vulnerability in
request processing before the application had the data (e.g. a buffer
overflow in the web server), the approach would not be able to prevent
this.  Another person agreed with the lack of good application logging
(agreed).  Another person asked if anyone has implemented the concept
(yes).  A WAF vendor thought the topic "interesting".  One person
asked about wrapping legacy applications up in an AppSensor-like
blanket (not exactly inside the app).
