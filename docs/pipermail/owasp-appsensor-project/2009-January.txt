Hello to the AppSensor mailing list!  I thought I'd send out a quick note
and update everyone on the status of AppSensor.

The AppSensor documentation reached beta status and was presented at OWASP
Portugal in November. Take a look at the document
<http://www.owasp.org/images/4/46/OWASP_AppSensor.pdf>and presentation
slides <https://www.owasp.org/images/7/77/Presentation_AppSensor.ppt>.

There are some exciting things planned for AppSensor in 2009. Most of the
upcoming work is possible due to my Graduate studies project which will
focus on furthering AppSensor. Over the next few months I will be building a
demonstration application which utilizes AppSensor. In addition, the policy
file will be implemented with the rule based language,
Jess<http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/>.
This will be some exciting work and I look forward to sharing the progress
and results.

I also very interested in everyone's thoughts on AppSensor. How did you find
AppSensor? What are your interests in this project? Are you utilizing
defensive programming procedures or automated response actions in your
applications?


Thanks and Happy New Year!
