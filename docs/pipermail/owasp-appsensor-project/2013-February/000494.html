</I>&gt;<i> Wiki pages can be created freely, but I was wondering what the plans
</I>&gt;<i> are for source code?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
IIRC, there was some discussion about eventually moving from Subversion
to Git, because it's supposedly much easier to manage branches and merging
back to the trunk with Git.  I don't recall where we left that conversation
at. I
know there was concern of looking the version history if we moved.  Google
Code now is supporting Git, so I don't think it's necessary to move to
GitHub
to do this.At least Google Code hasn't recently had any (public) security
breaches.
Anyhow, I still think that's open to debate as to whether we move and where
to.
I've not really given it any more attention since GSoC 2012 ended.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Will the URL code.google.com/p/appsensor/ change for the 2010 Java
</I>&gt;<i> version?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
See above.


&gt;<i>   Where will the new web services' code be?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Presently, it seems to be on 2 AppSensor branches. I'm not sure if John has
merged any of it to the trunk yet or not. But see:
&lt;<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fgsoc2012">http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fgsoc2012</A>
&gt;<i>
</I>and
&lt;
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fgsoc2012%20--username%20raufbutt%40gmail.com">http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fgsoc2012%20--username%20raufbutt%40gmail.com</A>
&gt;<i>
</I>
 - Where might we put other future code examples?
&gt;<i>
</I>
I would suggest creating a &quot;contrib' subdirectory and perhaps put them
there. Chris Schmidt did that for ESAPI Java. E.g., see:
&lt;<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-java/source/browse/#svn%2Fcontrib">http://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-java/source/browse/#svn%2Fcontrib</A>&gt;

- How will they be differentiated?
&gt;<i>
</I>
I think that they clearly should be kept separately from AppSensor proper.
The
bigger question IMO is how do we manage who can upload what examples. I'm
personally not comfortable with just giving commit privs to anyone who wants
to upload an example. Until it becomes unmanageable, I think a few of us
should vet the examples and perhaps take responsibility of uploading them.
If it becomes a lot of work because many are submitting examples, then we
might have to create a separate project for it and allow the contributors to
have commit priv there.  But to start off with, I think it's sufficient to
just
make a 'contrib' subdirectory similar to how we did for ESAPI.


&gt;<i> - Do we have preferred names for the previous and new versions (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> Integrated Java implementation, and SOAP Web Services)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How about just AppSensor and AppSensor-WS? Or if we are going to
</I>create a REST based web service and treat it separately, perhaps
AppSensor-SOAP-WS and AppSensor-REST-WS. If course if we do
that, we should probably refactor things to break out the common
components into a common core (AppSensor-Core?).


&gt;<i> It doesn't have to decided now, but I am hoping we don't lose
</I>&gt;<i> older/other versions. I'm just flagging the issue up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree that we don't want to lose the version history. There are ways
and tools to support moving from svn to git or svn to hg (Mercurial),
but I just don't think it's been on anyone's immediate radar.

BTW, as far as additional documentation is concerned, don't forget that
the AppSensor GSoC work is documented on the AppSensor Google
Code wiki. Specifically, &lt;<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/wiki/GSoC2012">http://code.google.com/p/appsensor/wiki/GSoC2012</A>&gt;.
There's not a lot there--it's mostly status updates--but you might find
something
useful there.
