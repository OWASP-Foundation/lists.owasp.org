Hi Philip,

While I do love the idea of having an electronic badge of this sort for
B-Sides Cape Town, at this time my opinion is that it would be more
beneficial to focus additional time (and perhaps money) on making the
conference a success.

Rather first have one or two excellent conferences, build up the community,
and then embark on this sort of endeavour when the conference has more
backing and a larger, more involved community.

Whatever you decide, good luck! :-)


Kind regards,
Yestin Johnson

Hi

Just from my perspective, if we have enough people then they can
separately work on different aspects.

For instance at Bsides last year they had talks, workshops and a CTF.
Badges could be an additional benefit to the conference as is the CTF.

It all depends on what time allows. Although from my confidence in
Philip I am sure he would be able to pull off something interesting.

All we really need is something like Philip did before with a cheap wifi
enabled chip. He used the LUA scripting to run a web server with a page
on a chip the size of around a matchbox. So in my mind we could make a
badge like that, where you connect via USB or whatever and change your
own page to display a nickname or name and then everyone else is able to
view the page and get your details if they want it.

Just some ideas I have in my head.

Obviously some of the hardware wizards could obviously pull of something
crazy.

My suggestion is: design the badge. Post it online so anybody who wants
a badge can build it themself.
Nothing bad can come from that.

Regards.

Hi

A open source security badge for other fledgling conferences is not a
bad idea.

Here is a cool link, although a little over the top maybe?

I wonder how much those badges will be lorded over the "badgeless" and
how much those badges could end up being worth on the day. ;-)

It's your conf, and you can do pretty much whatever you want (duh!)
but i figured i'd let you know why i traditionally didnt love "fancy
badges" at our confs..

My main aim was to encourage _everyone_ to start researching and
contributing (and a sub goal was to promote actual learning over
conference side-shows). Guys who have done the big confs will know
what i mean by conference sideshows (You can go to Defcon.. never
attend a talk, and do whickeycon or pool-con..)

Badges (for me) are border-line, because electronic kits could get ppl
interested and hacking on them, but i've almost always found them
being more of a distraction than anything else.. (if the goal is to
teach ppl how to hack on the teensy/friends.. give a talk / workshop
on it).

Andrew and Jameel dedicated a ton of time towards badge making on one
of the years, and i supported it (primarily because it meant that the
2 of them would be doing some learning/hacking). Although the badge
evening looked like a ton of fun, i was disappointed the next day when
tweets on the badge completely dwarfed tweets on talks.. The crowd had
their shiny "im a hacker thing" and wanted to show it to the world
(ignoring the "actual hacker" thing (learning)).

Of course.. many fine cons do it, and people would do cons for many reasons..

Hi Haroon

Many 2c's gets us close to a R1.

I agree that the focus should be on the talks. One goes to a conference
for the talks primarily, plus for the sharing of ideas.

Although on the one hand the additional attractions can pull more people
to the conference. Maybe the embedded community in SA.

As with most things maybe attempt a simple badge and based on demand. If
no demand then no badge. Maybe incorporate a talk around the badges.

Haroon you sounds like nothing but a negative nancy.

Maybe the talks that day really sucked compared to how cool the badge
was. Some software hacker guys will never touch hardware in their life
unless they have a very cool intro to it or are forced to do it. I think
the badge is a cool opportunity for that. And most software guys won't
go and attend a badge related workshop or presentation.

People who do hardware hacking deserve to get more attention.

I encourage any effort that anyone wants to put towards doing something
positive for the infosec community.

Regards.
Timo

Hi

Indeed the SA equivalent has found its way to wikileaks before. Although
they aren't receiving quite the same press as Hacked Team, it does seem
they have a somewhat similar clients based (based on wikileaks reports).

These types of technology firms/companies invite quite a bit of
attention globally, so happens to be that we heard about this breach
through the leak. Makes you wonder about the undisclosed breaches.

At least when Lockheed Martin got hit, the Chinese probably realized the
F-35 wasn't all it was promised to be.
