Hi Everyone.


Every year, we as OWASP Cape Town, assist the community run infosec/hacker
conference BSIDES Cape Town.


The call for papers is up so submit your talks:
http://www.bsidescapetown.co.za/call-for-papers-2018/. We already had great
talks this year and I am sure the community has lots more to talk about!


Also as its community driven we need volunteers every year to help out with
wrangling speakers, setting up networks or CTF, etc. Please sign up as a
volunteer! BSIDES Cape Town needs you!
http://www.bsidescapetown.co.za/volunteer-at-bsides-cape-town/


Have a great week and see you at BSIDES Cape Town Later this year

Christo
