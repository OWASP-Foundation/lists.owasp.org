Message-ID: <563CA4BB.7070901@owasp.org>


Hi Everyone

Change in the usual plan for OWASP Cape Town. We are moving the next
event to Tuesday the 10th, one day earlier.

We have a exciting guest who will attend our talk and also talk about
his work on the Cyber Bill. Our guest, Mark Heyink, has been studying
and commenting on the proposed law and is a strong advocate against some
of the loose wording and lack of technical input into writing the law.
Our guest has is an "Attorney and Information Governance and Security
Consultant".  You can view his page on http://privacyonline.co.za/. Timo
Goosen will also give some insight in his study of the Cyber Crime Bill
and will encourage discussion amongst members of the audience.

Some background on Mark: "Mark is an attorney who has been at the
forefront of the development of the Protection of Personal Information
Act as well other electronic information related legislation and is also
qualified and has extensive experience in the discipline of Information
Security."

Spread the word, this will definitely be a exciting talk.

Hi Everyone

Last week we had a discussion by Mark Heyink (Advocate with CISSP) on
the Cyber Crime Bill. If you wanted his presentation, comments on the
bill or a video of the talk, then you can follow the links on dropbox.

I apologize for the quality of the video. Only had my phone with me and
it overheated on 2 occasions.

Please if you have the time make some comments on the bill, Mark's
comments or provide them to OWASP CPT to present as a whole to
government. Public comments close on 30 Nov.

Cool I'm not sure what platform we should all use to interact we could
probably use this mailing list for now.

If you guys want to learn RE of malware then I suggest this tutorial series:
http://fumalwareanalysis.blogspot.kr/p/malware-analysis-tutorials-reverse.html

If anyone has hardware lying around it would be really cool to install this
on some old server hardware:
https://www.proteansec.com/linux/installing-using-cuckoo-malware-analysis-sandbox/

What I'm reading at the moment:(I'm mostly interested in Windows malware)
http://win32assembly.programminghorizon.com/tutorials.html

Its very important to know the PE structure:(Portable Executable)
https://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/PE

http://www.ntcore.com/files/inject2exe.htm#PEMakerDownloadLink5


Would be cool if we can get a collection of samples together and of
sample's source code.
I was thinking of getting together sometimes and everyone can share what
they are reading or working on.

Regards.
Timo

Subject: [Owasp-cape-town] Blackbeery and lawful interception
Message-ID: <5651C1F9.9060809@owasp.org>

Hi

180 degree change in attitude for Blackberry? Blackberry used to have to
fight governments to prevent interception of encrypted traffic.

Jumping on the bandwagon claiming: "At the same time, no one wants to
see terrorists and criminals taking advantage of encryption to evade
detection".

Subject: [Owasp-cape-town] Interesting javascript found in spam
Message-ID: <56521E7C.8050306@owasp.org>

Hi

Found this interesting as I found this in my own Spam folder. Even more
interesting was the .co.za domain it was supposedly sent from. Had a
look at the source of the email and seems it passed through some of
Internet Solutions servers.

Essentially a javascript downloader obsfucated by concatenating a string
through functions declared in a unsorted fashion, but called in the
specific order for execution.

Subject: [Owasp-cape-town] ZA: Cyber Crimes Bill comments please contribute
Message-ID: <56541B4E.4020706@owasp.org>

Hi Everyone

We have started commenting on the South African Cyber Crime Bill. This
bill is needed, but inherently flawed and should be re-drafted. Time is
running out as comment is reserved till end of the month.

We now call on the infosec and greater IT community to add to this
document so that we have something to present to the department of
Justice and advocate Mthunzi Mhaga (Mediaenquiries at justice.gov.za
<mailto:Mediaenquiries at justice.gov.za>, 083 641 8141).

Here is the google doc: *https://goo.gl/kr8nML

*The actual bill you can find here:
http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/invitations/CyberCrimesBill2015.pdf

Additionally I have made several resources available on the bill from
Mark Heyink (advocate & CISSP):
https://www.dropbox.com/home/Public/OWASP%20Cyber%20Crime%20Talk

*_If you wish to remain anonymous you can send me your submissions via
email and I will add it to the document._*

Please contribute as this can make a difference.

Hi Everyone

Hopefully last update from my side.

Forgot to add edit rights for public. This is the intention of the
document: Public must add to it.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pitMEJ5PDKm_jC2VVrWVCQ93mF5rMTxNpMEcrm10sS0/edit?usp=sharing
or https://goo.gl/kr8nML


On another note time is of the essence, comments must be in by 30 Nov.

?Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can
change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.? ?
Margaret Mead <http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/61107.Margaret_Mead>

Thank you for your contribution to this cause

Subject: [Owasp-cape-town] Comments on CyberCrimes Bill - S J Robbertse
Message-ID: <565C3F96.4000502@owasp.org>

Hi

I represent a Non-profit community driven local chapter of a Global NGO
called OWASP (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page). As OWASP Cape
Town (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cape_Town) we partnered with Mark
Heyink to produce comments for the Bill.

Our document comprises technical knowledge on aspects of the bill, that
we publicly gathered from Information Security professionals and ICT
professionals in our community. We have grave concerns on aspects of the
bill and we call for redrafting of large sections. Even the IT
terminology is inaccurate and we fear the repercussions this bill could
have on innocent individuals or the thriving ICT/IT sector in South Africa.

We call on government to delay the bill to allow better drafting and
partnership with private organizations such as OWASP Cape Town, Privacy
Online (www.privacyonline.co.za) and the man Information Security
companies in South Africa.

Attached are both the google document of the final version and a .docx
attachment.

Only together can we secure our infrastructure for tomorrow.
