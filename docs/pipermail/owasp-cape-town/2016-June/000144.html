<PRE>Hi
Dealing with this problem is what I call a bad day in the (security) office:
This &#8216;Demonically Clever&#8217; Backdoor Hides In a Tiny Slice of a Computer Chip
<A HREF="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/demonically-clever-backdoor-hides-inside-computer-chip">https://www.wired.com/2016/06/demonically-clever-backdoor-hides-inside-computer-chip</A>

&lt;snip&gt;

Here&#8217;s how that analog hack works: After the chip is fully designed and
ready to be fabricated, a saboteur adds a single component to its &#8220;mask,&#8221;
the blueprint that governs its layout. That single component or &#8220;cell&#8221;&#8212;of
which there are hundreds of millions or even billions on a modern chip&#8212;is
made out of the same basic building blocks as the rest of the processor:
wires and transistors that act as the on-or-off switches that govern the
chip&#8217;s logical functions. But this cell is secretly designed to act as a
capacitor, a component that temporarily stores electric charge.

Every time a malicious program&#8212;say, a script on a website you visit&#8212;runs a
certain, obscure command, that capacitor cell &#8220;steals&#8221; a tiny amount of
electric charge and stores it in the cell&#8217;s wires without otherwise
affecting the chip&#8217;s functions. With every repetition of that command, the
capacitor gains a little more charge. Only after the &#8220;trigger&#8221; command is
sent many thousands of times does that charge hit a threshold where the
cell switches on a logical function in the processor to give a malicious
program the full operating system access it wasn&#8217;t intended to have. &#8220;It
takes an attacker doing these strange, infrequent events in high frequency
for a duration of time,&#8221; says Austin. &#8220;And then finally the system shifts
into a privileged state that lets the attacker do whatever they want.&#8221;

That capacitor-based trigger design means it&#8217;s nearly impossible for anyone
testing the chip&#8217;s security to stumble on the long, obscure series of
commands to &#8220;open&#8221; the backdoor. And over time, the capacitor also leaks
out its charge again, closing the backdoor so that it&#8217;s even harder for any
auditor to find the vulnerability.

&lt;snip&gt;


Regards,

Liam
