<PRE>Hi Philip

Those are both good device options. I've been chatting to Ross about
those two as well. One other in the same price range that I can
suggest is an Arduino Nano v 3. This is obviously very adaptable /
reusable. Then again the only one I don't have of the three is the
DigiSpark so there is that. ;-)

No reflow oven or even a rework station I'm afraid. However I do have
a decent soldering station which would be slower but I could help out
with soldering. Maybe with the right technique and enough flux it
could be feasible. ;-) Pre-conference soldering party?

Either way if we're going to get badges from parts made in China then
we better get moving because shipping is often very slow and subject
to customs delays. And faster shipping is way more expensive and could
still get stuck in customs...


Regards,

Liam
