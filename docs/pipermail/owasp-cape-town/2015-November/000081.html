Hi Everyone

Change in the usual plan for OWASP Cape Town. We are moving the next
event to Tuesday the 10th, one day earlier.

We have a exciting guest who will attend our talk and also talk about
his work on the Cyber Bill. Our guest, Mark Heyink, has been studying
and commenting on the proposed law and is a strong advocate against some
of the loose wording and lack of technical input into writing the law.
Our guest has is an &quot;Attorney and Information Governance and Security
Consultant&quot;.  You can view his page on <A HREF="http://privacyonline.co.za/.">http://privacyonline.co.za/.</A> Timo
Goosen will also give some insight in his study of the Cyber Crime Bill
and will encourage discussion amongst members of the audience.

Some background on Mark: &quot;Mark is an attorney who has been at the
forefront of the development of the Protection of Personal Information
Act as well other electronic information related legislation and is also
qualified and has extensive experience in the discipline of Information
Security.&quot;

Spread the word, this will definitely be a exciting talk.
