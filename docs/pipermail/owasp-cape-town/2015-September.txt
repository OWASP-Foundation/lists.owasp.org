Hi Everyone,

I thought I should share the Webcast: see the link below it gives more
information on Owasp Security Knowledge Framework.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2WoBiGiyPQ&feature=youtu.be

In this episode, Fabio Cerullo talks with Glenn Ten Cate from the
Netherlands. He is the project lead for the OWASP Security Knowledge
Framework along with his brother Riccardo.
