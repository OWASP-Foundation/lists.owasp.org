Hi Everyone

The BSIDES committee is proud to announce that ticket sales are open for 
2017!

We have 4 different ticket categories, as well as a electronic badge 
add-on this year.

This conference is aimed at all people involved, interested or keen to 
get involved in Infosec. Otherwise just come and join for a day of 
interesting people, hacks, talks and hackathons.


All are welcome and we especially invite all students, with a discounted 
student ticket.

See you there.
Christo Goosen
