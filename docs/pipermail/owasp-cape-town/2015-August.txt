Hi

Very Nice summary of the Metasploit framework. I like the SQLMAP section
--  don't forget about "armitage" which is the GUI interface for the
MSFconsole, quite nicely done with the capability to easily "Hail Mary" the
exploits and payloads (not always ideal, but handy in some cases).

As a side note --
if you look at using Metasploit to attack OS and Applications consider
targeting the Network Device infrastructure using "Yersinia", nice options
for MITM and DOS  --  but of course best results with Yesrinia is achieved
if you are physically on the target network already, which isn't always the
case.

Message-ID: <55D6F8BC.1060708@owasp.org>

Hi

As a personal project I am looking into the current Academic offerings
for Infosec in ZA. So far I have uncovered the following things:

UCT course in computer forensics (bit pricey):
https://www.commerce.uct.ac.za/InformationSystems/CourseInfo/INF4016W

Rhodes University Msc in Information Security:
http://www.ru.ac.za/media/rhodesuniversity/content/computerscience/documents/Information%20Security%20Information%20Sheet%202016.pdf

CPUT:
https://www.cput.ac.za/academic/shortcourses/other/article/2663/certificate-cyber-security

CSIR and government funded research has also seen the importance of
infosec:http://researchspace.csir.co.za/dspace/bitstream/10204/4042/1/Taute_2009.pdf

Anyone have any to add to the list?

Subject: [Owasp-cape-town] Next OWASP CPT Meetup: PCI DSS for Everyone
Message-ID: <55D6FBB6.6030402@owasp.org>

Hi Everyone

We are excited to announce our next OWASP Cape Town event with a guest
speaker Dr Evan Summers.

Here is a summary of the next talk:

"The PCI DSS
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard> (Data
Security Standard) provides information security objectives for the
payment card industry. Its recommendations are common sense, e.g. use a
firewall to secure your network, regularly scan your network for
vulnerabilities, and monitor your network for intrusions.

We will consider and discuss PCI DSS as a useful security standard for
everyone (i.e. beyond credit card processing companies) to improve the
security of our IT applications, systems and networks.

About The Speaker:

Dr Evan Summers (@evanxsummers) is a Principal Consultant at Saratoga.
Currently he works with the IOL digital media team at World Wide
Creative, using Node.js, ReactJS and Redis to build websites for
Independent Media. Last year this team produced a ?new? IOL mobi site
<http://mobi.iol.co.za/#%21/section/top>, and currently they are
building a new responsive site for IOL."

Please keep an eye on the following page for details on the location,
although it might likely be at VOSS again:
http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Cape-Town-Chapter-Meetup/events/224785079/ 


Thank You

Hi Christo

"OK Google".

I.e. your phone definitely and tablet (probably) already have DSPs.

So potential for abuse but then just about everything does...

Yeah defo dedicated sound processing chips are the start of Skynet / it's
backdoored for the NSA to listen to you streaming Internet radio.

Ag no man...don't be daft. DSPs have been around for decades - it's just a
processor that's dedicated for handling signals better than your main
processor. In fact the main processors of today would run circles around
the DSPs of 2 years ago. At best something like voice recognition (or
breaking it down to smaller symbol chunks) is now done on-chip and not in
software, meaning voice snooping malware is now 100 lines of code and not
1000 and it requires less bandwidth as it does speech to text and not raw
audio...;)

Interesting angle on it. Making it more efficient to (ab)use. :-)

Hi Roelof

I wasn't considering Phones which obviously are a separate discussion.

I was just thinking in terms of previous fears and how this could be
used:
http://www.tgdaily.com/hardware-opinion/39455-big-brother-potentially-exists-right-now-in-our-pcs-compliments-of-intels-vpr

Was just imagining that this could be used not when you are listening to
Spotify, but rather when you suspect its off or 'hibernating'.
