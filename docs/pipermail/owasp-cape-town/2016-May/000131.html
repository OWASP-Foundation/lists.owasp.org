<PRE>I know that the community is cautious about acting in concert against
government initiatives, partly because of the nature of this group.

However, I grew up during apartheid: this government is very similar - they
show every inclination to centralize control to their own benefit, not that
of the nation.

Nobody wants harmful material on the net, however the way in which these
fears can be used are concerning. No act that imposes censorship should
be hustled through parliament: this deserves reflective consideration by
all parties.

I support the view of Timo: each day we wait will give this government the
comfort that they can proceed without challenge. Please take action if you
agree. Don't look back later and wish you had acted while you had the
opportunity.

&gt;<i> Our government is trying to sneak in another censorship bill. I didn't

</I>&gt;<i> &quot; The bill requires anyone who creates, produces, publishes or advertises
</I>&gt;<i> any publication that contains sexual conduct, violates or shows disrespect
</I>&gt;<i> for the right to human dignity of any person, degrades a person, or
</I>&gt;<i> constitutes incitement to cause harm, to submit it for examination and

</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;The (FPB) Act was passed in 1996 when there wasn&#8217;t much internet and
</I>&gt;<i> electronic communication. We now operate in a completely different
</I>&gt;<i> landscape and the bill is the FPB&#8217;s attempt to modernise the way they
</I>&gt;<i> operate for online world.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> ....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It allows the board to classify and regulate the distribution of online
</I>&gt;<i> content to ensure cyber safety for children and that children are protected
</I>&gt;<i> from disturbing and harmful content on social media and mobile platforms.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can read about the bill here:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are your thoughts about this bill? Are you guys planning on
</I>&gt;<i> commenting?
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should be scared about any bill that is pushed to be put into
</I>&gt;<i> action so quickly.
</I>&gt;<i> I also think we should think of the consequences of such a bill. Imagine
</I>&gt;<i> if I wanted to release a video
</I>&gt;<i> of the Marikana massacre then I would have to submit it to some board for
</I>&gt;<i> review. This reminds me
</I>&gt;<i> a great deal of the apartheid government when pornography was censored etc
</I>&gt;<i> and when
</I>&gt;<i> the government could very conveniently decide to ban books that they
</I>&gt;<i> thought weren't appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> for mass consumption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I challenge you all to read over this bill and to make the phone ring or
</I>&gt;<i> send as many emails as possible with comments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards.
