<PRE>Hey Everyone!


Join us for a great talk:


  To S or NOT to S, that is the HTTP


Abstract:Hendrik Visage

With the advent of LetsEncrypt, the Snowden stuff and Google preferring 
HTTPS for search rankings, the author would raise the question(s) 
whether the addition of encryption really makes sense or not, given the 
experiences that StackExchange had with implementing HTTPS over a period 
of 4years to their systems and security as a whole for a given situation 
and/or web site. The author would highlight a few cases where the 
addition of encryption would raise false sense of security, rather than 
adding any real value to the security/etc. so claimed.


Author:

Having spent more than 20years in the IT industry in various security 
and system administration related roles, the author
came up with a security model to educate and &#8220;enlighten&#8221; people about 
their roles and the rest of the computer components,
in securing a service or computer. This model was previousy presented at 
BSides and ICSA 2011.


See you there

Christo
