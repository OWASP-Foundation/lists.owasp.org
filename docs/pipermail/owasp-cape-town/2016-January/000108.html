<PRE>So I have this idea for something that I want to do, but I'm not sure how
to start and how to do it.
There is allot of emphasis in this country on BEE and uplifting the poor in
general, but in my opinion the best way to ensure the future of this
country is if we get people to transfer their skills to other people. The
whole concept of &quot;give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man
to fish and you feed him for a lifetime&quot; is something that I think we need
to do in this country, the teaching a man to fish part that is.

Anyways I want to start something related to skills transfer but especially
in the infosec industry.
I've tried contacting Johnny Long who runs hackers for charity, but I never
get replies.  It will be aimed at under privileged people (anyone who does
not come from a rich family)
whatever there race might be.

I'd like to find a way to help kids who are at school but interested in
infosec or IT in general to
help teach them the right stuff and also to mentor them all the way to the
point where they get placed in an internship or a job.

Not sure how to do this or where to start. Anyone have any idea of where I
can start and how? It would be cool
if companies could some how get involved, but I don't want people to do
something just so they can score BEE or BEE SME Development points, I want
people to help with this just cause they genuinely care for this country
and want to make it a better place.

Thanks.

Regards.
Timo
