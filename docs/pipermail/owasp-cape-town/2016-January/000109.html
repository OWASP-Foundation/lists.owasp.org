<PRE>Hi Timo,

I like the idea. I must say getting people who are like minded is not easy.
Starting at the Bandiwidth Barn in Khayelitsha might be a start. They have
the infrastructure in place (Computer lab in a managed facility) we can
chat with people managing the place and take it from there. Let me know
what you think and I will be in contact with the Bandwidth Barn head office
(Woodstock exchange) to see how far the process can go.
