Hi Timo,

I assume you are referring to physical hardware? I also assume that you require this to be accessible remotely?

Hi Timo,

I have a spare HP N54L Microserver that we can use. It isn't a power house. I use it to run VMs and to play with stuff. The machine isn't made to take heavy load.

It depends on your intended use. Seeing that the threat is about malware research I assume that we will use the machine to act as a host for such tasks. This will require us to lock it down as well.

Hi Everyone

The CyberCrime and CyberSecurity Bill was based on a Policy Framework
already approved by cabinet in 2012. It has only recently been
de-classified for the public to review: National Cybersecurity Policy
Framework: http://www.gov.za/sites/www.gov.za/files/39475_gon609.pdf.
Also for those who wish not to go to a .gov.za server:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/o4d0nh2fn2sfbfr/39475_gon609.pdf?dl=0.

Ironically this has been done 4 days after comments on the CyberCrimes
Bill closed. This should give some indication to everyone on how the SSA
is handling this matter. Clearly want to fas-track and rubber stamp this
bill.
