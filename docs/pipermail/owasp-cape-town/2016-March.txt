Hey guys thought I'd send out some links for you guys after last night's
presentation.

Those of you that are not familiar with SQL Injection yet. Here is a very
good playlist that you can watch on youtube that teaches you sql injection.
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkiAz1NPnw8qEgzS7cgVMKavvOAdogsro

Someone had a question on NOSQL Injection here is some reading material on
that:

https://blogs.adobe.com/security/files/2011/04/NoSQL-But-Even-Less-Security.pdf

http://www.slideshare.net/44Con/pentesting-nosql-dbs-with-nosql-exploitation-framework

I will try get Keith's slides so we can post it online.
Thanks for everyone who attended and thanks to VOSS Solutions for
sponsoring the venue,snacks and beer.

Regards.
Timo
