Hey everyone hope you are all still doing good.

The meetup is still going and Christo,Liam and I are all still alive. Sorry
we are so quiet.
We are hoping to have an event maybe somewhere in next Month.

Does anyone feel like doing a presentation?
I'm hoping to do a presentation soon, just waiting for things to get a
little less busy.
If anyone else has something they want to talk about then go ahead and
schedule a talk.

Is anyone from Cape Town going to ITWeb later this month?

Regards.

Hi there,

I shall be attending the itweb summit with a few work colleagues in jhb
(work for T-Systems). Hoping to do some brainstorm-networking. In general
trying to make security a big deal in the organisation from the SA side of
things, as an analyst myself.
Keen to meet any others going up.

Kind regards

Hey guys the company that I work for is looking for an intern.
(Hope you don't mind me posting this here.)

I'm just asking on their behalf.

If you are looking for a paid internship. Then pop me a mail and I will
give you the email for our HR person.  I don't know any of the details of
what they are looking for, but I do know that they are looking for someone
with lots of enthusiasm and who is interested in security.

The technologies you will be working with are: "Kaspersky, McAfee,
Websense, FortiWeb".

Subject: [Owasp-cape-town] Yet Another Censor Ship Bill (Got Until Thursday
	to Comment)
Message-ID: <5741D01D.4030901@runbox.com>

Our government is trying to sneak in another censorship bill. I didn't
read anything
about it online until I picked up the Friday Cape Argus. On the front
page there was a story on the bill.
" The bill requires anyone who creates, produces, publishes or
advertises any publication that contains sexual conduct, violates or
shows disrespect for the right to human dignity of any person, degrades
a person, or constitutes incitement to cause harm, to submit it for
examination and classification by the board."
http://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/news/cyber-censors-hovering-2024009

"

?The (FPB) Act was passed in 1996 when there wasn?t much internet and
electronic communication. We now operate in a completely different
landscape and the bill is the FPB?s attempt to modernise the way they
operate for online world.?
....

It allows the board to classify and regulate the distribution of online
content to ensure cyber safety for children and that children are
protected from disturbing and harmful content on social media and mobile
platforms.
"


You can read about the bill here:
http://www.fpb.org.za/profile-fpb/legislation1/594-redraft-fpb-online-regulation-policy-2016/file


What are your thoughts about this bill? Are you guys planning on commenting?
I think we should be scared about any bill that is pushed to be put into
action so quickly.
I also think we should think of the consequences of such a bill. Imagine
if I wanted to release a video
of the Marikana massacre then I would have to submit it to some board
for review. This reminds me
a great deal of the apartheid government when pornography was censored
etc and when
the government could very conveniently decide to ban books that they
thought weren't appropriate
for mass consumption.

I challenge you all to read over this bill and to make the phone ring or
send as many emails as possible with comments.

Regards.
Timo

I know that the community is cautious about acting in concert against
government initiatives, partly because of the nature of this group.

However, I grew up during apartheid: this government is very similar - they
show every inclination to centralize control to their own benefit, not that
of the nation.

Nobody wants harmful material on the net, however the way in which these
fears can be used are concerning. No act that imposes censorship should
be hustled through parliament: this deserves reflective consideration by
all parties.

I support the view of Timo: each day we wait will give this government the
comfort that they can proceed without challenge. Please take action if you
agree. Don't look back later and wish you had acted while you had the
opportunity.

- Tony

This bill looks like a step back towards apartheid.  Given the vague
wording, it would likely be used as a blanket censorship tool.

It is especially concerning that they make explicit mention of showing
disrespect for someone's right to dignity, as opposed to violating their
right to dignity.  Perhaps exposing corruption is disrespectful to the
government?

I do not support this bill.

Given the number of issues raised in the past few months, I am wondering
whether ZaCon should adopt some process where
a) we as a community can consider whether we would like to take a position
b) if we do want to take a position, write a common statement

Obviously not everything should be considered or will be relevant; but it
would make sense to have a community view than individual views.

My 2 cents

I'll take a contrarian view on this. I don't view ZaCon as the local EFF
(US crowd rather than the red berets), and entering the political space
will change the dynamic of this group.

For example, if someone supports a particular stance but ZaCon issues a
statement in opposition, then that person would be (in effect) forced out
for political views. For a list with technical underpinnings, that would be
an undesirable outcome in my view.

I think it's also somewhat moot since ZaCon exists solely as a mailing
list. I can't see statements issued at this stage carrying any weight.

Perhaps what these debates are suggesting is that there is space for a
local EFF, with a specific focus on activism and lobbying? If R2K isn't
fulfilling that role, they might be open to expanding into that space, or a
new org could rise.
