<PRE>Haroon you sounds like nothing but a negative nancy.


&gt;<i> tweets on the badge completely dwarfed tweets on talks.. The crowd had
</I>&gt;<i> their shiny &quot;im a hacker thing&quot; and wanted to show it to the world
</I>&gt;<i> (ignoring the &quot;actual hacker&quot; thing (learning)).
</I>Maybe the talks that day really sucked compared to how cool the badge
was. Some software hacker guys will never touch hardware in their life
unless they have a very cool intro to it or are forced to do it. I think
the badge is a cool opportunity for that. And most software guys won't
go and attend a badge related workshop or presentation.

People who do hardware hacking deserve to get more attention.

I encourage any effort that anyone wants to put towards doing something
positive for the infosec community.

Regards.
Timo
