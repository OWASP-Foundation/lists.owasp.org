<PRE>Hi guys..

It's your conf, and you can do pretty much whatever you want (duh!)
but i figured i'd let you know why i traditionally didnt love &quot;fancy
badges&quot; at our confs..

My main aim was to encourage _everyone_ to start researching and
contributing (and a sub goal was to promote actual learning over
conference side-shows). Guys who have done the big confs will know
what i mean by conference sideshows (You can go to Defcon.. never
attend a talk, and do whickeycon or pool-con..)

Badges (for me) are border-line, because electronic kits could get ppl
interested and hacking on them, but i've almost always found them
being more of a distraction than anything else.. (if the goal is to
teach ppl how to hack on the teensy/friends.. give a talk / workshop
on it).

Andrew and Jameel dedicated a ton of time towards badge making on one
of the years, and i supported it (primarily because it meant that the
2 of them would be doing some learning/hacking). Although the badge
evening looked like a ton of fun, i was disappointed the next day when
tweets on the badge completely dwarfed tweets on talks.. The crowd had
their shiny &quot;im a hacker thing&quot; and wanted to show it to the world
(ignoring the &quot;actual hacker&quot; thing (learning)).

Of course.. many fine cons do it, and people would do cons for many reasons..
