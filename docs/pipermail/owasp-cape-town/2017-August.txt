	Cloud Era
Message-ID: <CAMOWqYCYHKLFAT4VAwyMjvWipd9pi4PyLsPDa7H4ebyhXnkF3g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone.

I just would like to anounce and promote our next chapter meetup for OWASP
Cape Town Chapter.


Marco from Thinkst.com will be speaking about: "Attacking and Defending in
the Cloud Era."
I think this will be a very interesting talk to hear where pentesting is
going in a world were a great deal of infrastructure is moving to the cloud
and where many applications are becoming "serverless".


You can read more about the event here:

Email me if you have any questions.

Regards.
Timo
