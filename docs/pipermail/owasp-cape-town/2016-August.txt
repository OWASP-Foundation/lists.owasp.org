Hi Everyone


A quick update on whats been going on with OWASP Cape Town and OWASP.org.


        Cape Town:

More comments and advice is being prepared for the Cyber Crimes Bill.
Spent time this week in Cape Town with a group of lawyers, forensics &
tech experts on drafting further combined commentary on the bill. A lot
of good work is going into making it a viable bill.

For more insight on "Cyber Policy" have a look at this youtube series:

        OWASP:

Here is the google translate version of an announcement by the 
"Franco-German initiative on internal security in Europe".

https://translate.google.co.za/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.interieur.gouv.fr%2FActualites%2FL-actu-du-Ministere%2FInitiative-franco-allemande-sur-la-securite-interieure-en-Europe&edit-text=

The crux is the second-last paragraph starting with "They propose" and 
specifically

    At European level, it would tax the uncooperative operators to
    remove illegal content or decrypt messages as part of
    investigations.

or in normal English, the French are proposing that the EU Commission 
require telecom operators to have a key to decrypt messages and hand 
over that key on demand.

Thanks for sharing, Hans.

Technically, how is this even possible, since encryption happens at the servers hosting the websites?

And regarding networks like TOR... don't these run over ISP networks? If so, how can ISPs decrypt data that is routed using protocols like TOR?

Thanks,
Daniel

Hi


From the article what one can gather is the same kind of issues
Blackberry faced in UAE and Dubai. Basically anyone providing a
encrypted service would have to hand over their private keys to allow
French security services to decrypt all traffic. Its similar to this
kind of play:
https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160708/07535134919/putin-says-all-encryption-must-be-backdoored-two-weeks.shtml


They won't be able to target everything. The easiest targets are
companies as proved through Google, Microsoft, etc. giving in to demands
by the 3 letter agencies in the US. Some companies like BlueCoat provide
man-in-the-middle type services where they are able to
(https://www.bluecoat.com/products-and-solutions/ssl-visibility-appliance),
but with services like TOR or OTR its not really possible. Surveillance
is a numbers game, breaking encryption without design flaws takes time
and computing power. Services like TOR & OTR change keys often thus
making it nearly impossible to break into. Telegram on the other hand is
an open-source app connecting to a closed source service.


Also consider the wording around: "operators offering products or
telecommunications or Internet services in the European Union". As long
as a company does not have sales offices in the EU I think they would be
exempt.


Thanks
