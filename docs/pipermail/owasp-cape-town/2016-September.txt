Hi,

sorry for being slow.

For me, the main message in the press release was that even the former 
bastions of free speech and privacy are now vulnerable. And where 
there is a political will there is a technical way. For example, 
requiring registration for any particular service and then 
criminalising nonregistration.

The second message was the fact of a press release itself: A French 
minister feels it is necessary to tell the world what they intend to 
do, in the presence of the German minister. In other words, he must 
either be under pressure from the French electorate, or he is sending 
a message to the Germans to quit being complicated about surveillance 
and just do it.

Regards,

Hans

Subject: [Owasp-cape-town] Petition against: Films and Publications
	Amendment Bill
Message-ID: <43d8af4c-e3df-9259-d9b7-afba024a7159@owasp.org>

Hi Everyone


Please take some time and sign the petition to oppose the Films and
Publications Amendment Bill. As stated by the DA's petition
(https://www.da.org.za/petition-throw-internet-censorship-bill/): 



-- 

>
>         The Films and Publications Amendment Bill, in its current
>         form, is an attempt by government to censor the internet.
>
>         The Bill, also known as the Internet Censorship Bill, is an
>         attempt to force all social media users to register with the
>         Film and Publications Board (FPB) before uploading videos to
>         social media sites.
>
>         If the Bill is passed, it will be an unjustifiable
>         infringement on the constitutional right to privacy, placing
>         all viewers of X18-rated content on a list which government
>         will have unrestricted access to.
>
>         And it will give government the power to pre-classify online
>         content before you share it with your friends and family.
>
>         This attempt to censor South Africans' use of the Internet
>         threatens our democracy by limiting freedom of speech.
>

Please sign the petition and share:
