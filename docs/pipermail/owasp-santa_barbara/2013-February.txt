All,

While I know it's been slow in getting off its feet, we're happy to
announce the first official OWASP Santa Barbara meet. This meeting will
take place on Thursday, February 28th at 6:30pm.

To start us out, we're going to meet at the Redspin offices at 4690
Carpinteria Ave, Ste B, in Carpinteria, CA (93013). It's about 10-15minutes
south of downtown. This is so we have a quiet place to do introductions,
and then we can walk over to one of the nearby restaurants to continue the
meeting, as well as plan out future events. One topic of conversation will
be future locations, probably downtown.

Please respond to the list to let us know if you're planning to attend,
just so that we know how many to expect and how long we should stay at the
office/meeting location before going to a restaurant.

Thanks, and we're looking forward to seeing everyone soon!
