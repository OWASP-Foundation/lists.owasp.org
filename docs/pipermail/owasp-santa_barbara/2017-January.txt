Hi All,

AppSec California is fast approaching! The event is being held next week
down in Santa Monica. As part of the planning committee for the conference,
I have a few discounts available if you are not able to go due to funding.
Please reach out to me directly.

Hope to see you there!

Jimmy

Subject: [Owasp-santa_barbara] free ticket for AppSec Cali next week
Message-ID: <CA+V_MsKtSsAuq+kCm=SP6rq+sDhYkzb2y-CRMri=KAMWRu1=wg@mail.gmail.com>

I have a free ticket I can give away for AppSec Cali next week, for the 2
day conference (Tue/Wed 24-25). I'm still waiting on someone's confirmation
to take it but in case that doesn't happen I thought I'd share with you in
advance, since I don't want it to go to waste.

If you're interested please email me privately and I'll keep you posted.  I
expect to have an answer from this other person by the end of today, but
you may want to go ahead and check your schedule/work to see if you'd be
able to attend, since this is happening early next week.

Other people from SB are going, so there's also the chance to carpool.

Cheers,
Mart?n.
