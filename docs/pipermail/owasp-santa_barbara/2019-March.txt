Message-ID: <CAOXDvD_g-n8r7tovSp7bw5f7bRvZKskSqqRTuv-YG2buK+6GcA@mail.gmail.com>

Following up on the recent messages stating that this mailman list will be
retired by the end of this week, I wanted to take the chance to reiterate
the invitation to join the new OWASP SB discussion group at:

https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/santa-barbara-chapter

Please make sure you sign up since this new discussion group will be the
main form of communication (official events will still be announced using
meetup.com).

Slowly but steadily we're growing the security community in SB and nearby
cities :)

Cheers,
Mart?n.
