Subject: [Owasp-santa_barbara] July Meeting -- Call for Presentations
Message-ID: <CAAQGs2LgOzA1q7wEybsXsznJhPniNca_1ucjzHgEVOB5Nc47dg@mail.gmail.com>

Santa Barbarians,

We are tentatively scheduling a meeting for next Thursday, July 25th.
Location is currently TBD, but we're hoping to use either the PayJunction
offices (as we did last time), or the Redspin offices (where the first
meeting took place).

The tentative time is 6:00pm.

If you have a talk, case study or discussion ideas, please respond on-list
(or email me directly) and we'll try to get you on the schedule. If not, we
can have more general conversation.

I know that with Blackhat and DEFCON coming up, some people may be
unavailable; if we get a lot of people who can't make it, we might
reschedule for after the conferences. Once a location is determined, I'll
shoot out another email confirming.

Thanks, and hope to see you all next week!

Aw bummer, I can't make it.

For future meetings, I could give some (mostly CTF-centered) talks about
debugging, dynamic analysis with valgrind, ROP, etc. Not sure how on-topic
those are in this context, but I figured I'd mention them in case we get
desperate for presentations :-)

Greetings~ 

PayJunction will be unable to host due to blackhat and defcon. We'll try again next time.

That sounds awesome, Yan! Let's plan one of those for the next meeting.

OWASP Santa Barbara,

We will be having a (probably somewhat small) meeting this Thursday, July
25th, at the Redspin offices in Carpinteria. The meeting will run from
6:00pm until probably around 7 or 7:30 -- shorter than the last time.

Redspin's address is: 4690 Carpinteria Ave, Suite B, Carpinteria, CA 93013.
There is a parking lot next to the office, as well as parking on the street.

Hope to see you all there, and for those of you who can't make it, hope to
see you in Vegas for the conferences!

- David

Santa Barbara,

Unfortunately, our speaker had a last-minute change of plans (happy
birthday, Jason!), and what with many OWASP members already traveling to
Black Hat, we have decided to postpone this meeting until, tentatively,
August 8th. After the conferences, we should be able to come back to Santa
Barbara and hit the ground running! I'm excited to see everyone again and
discuss what neat trends, tricks, and ideas we all learned at the
conferences.

Jason and Yan have both expressed interest in speaking at the next meeting,
and I'm excited to hear what they have to say. I'll be in touch with each
of them individually to understand the exact topics and length of
presentations.

Exact time and location are TBD, but I look forward to announcing it ASAP.

Thanks everyone, and sorry to anyone who may have been inconvenienced!

David
