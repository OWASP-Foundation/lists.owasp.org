I?m still leaning towards using the same room as last time or pushing this back a week to do some more marketing/outreach to raise attendance levels.
Let?s make a decision by EOB on Wednesday.

Hi All,

We did not get the turnout we hoped for in the RSVP email and we have
decided to postpone the OWASP SB Chapter meeting that was scheduled for
tomorrow to a later date.  Please keep me in the loop with any ideas that
you have for the meeting or presentations to give.

In the mean time, we were thinking about having some OWASP "happy hours" at
a local bar or restaurant every now and then as more of a social event.
Would anyone be interested in this?

Thanks,

Jimmy

OWASP happy hours where we could meet and chat about old school topics like
the 2600 hz gift in the cereal box would be great.  Definitely count me in.

The last security groups I had been to in Bay Area were all happy hour
based. Since I had been looking forward to an OWASP meeting this evening,
if anyone feels like an in-prompto- happy hour meeting tonight....I'm in.
I'm working a half day today, so I'm in a good mood right now.

_Daniel

A longer list here: http://www.davidpricco.com/santa-barbara-startups/

them know about our meetings. Get them to sign up to this list! Get people
talking!

Anyone going to any of these conferences?   I'm going to the one in NY next
week, and most likely to the one SM next year as well, although they
haven't published any info on the latter yet.   If you're going, I'll be
happy to meet you there.  It'll be my first time in NY so I'll be checking
out the city and its nightlife as well.
