Subject: [Owasp-santa_barbara] November OWASP Santa Barbara Meeting - Call
	for Speakers
Message-ID: <CAHNzttaCadZB8OhUOT8fZTduJ-TK8X6c9_Of2jVzea=VPyR6hQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Everyone!

Since we had such a great turnout and participation at the last OWASP SB
meeting, we will be holding another meeting Thursday, November 7th at
6:30pm. The meeting is tentatively scheduled to be held at the same
location as last time (maybe a different room) at the Citrix office in
Goleta.

The location is: 7402 Hollister Avenue (Bldg 8), Goleta, CA. (Room TBD)

We are working out some ideas for labs and talks for this meeting and this
officially opens up the floor for you all to submit a presentation. Please
respond to me with any ideas for presentations, hands-on labs, or
discussions ASAP.

More details to come.

I hope to see you all there!

Jimmy Mesta

Co-Founder: OWASP Santa Barbara

Goleta.

The date and time: Thursday, November 7th at 6:30pm

The location: 7402 Hollister Avenue (Bldg 8), Goleta, CA. (Room TBD)

This is also a reminder that we are *still looking for volunteers to give

Please reach out to me with any questions.

Thanks and see you there!

Jimmy

Subject: [Owasp-santa_barbara] Correction: OWASP Meeting November 7th
Message-ID: <CAHNzttZ_NDuzEFcdXeWLhDqVOjDSJgz6TavHiGs2XTNpXz0MZw@mail.gmail.com>

The subject line of my last email said November 5th when in fact, the
meeting is on Thursday, November 7th. Sorry for the confusion!

Again, the OWASP meeting is *Thursday, November 7th at 6:30pm*

I will send out another email next week with an agenda.

Thanks,

Jimmy
