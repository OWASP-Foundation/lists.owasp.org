*Speaker/Discussion:* Jason Haddix (bug bounties and how to augment your
application security program), followed by open discussion

*Notes:* Parking is available in the (large) AppFolio parking lot, so no
need to worry about that. Meeting is inside the building, upstairs.

we'd appreciate it).

Subject: [Owasp-santa_barbara] Thanks for a great meeting last night!
Message-ID: <CAAQGs2JhmJ2-Wrz5E1PkFbu0RbsCmri4nL+qy3=CMGZkAWW6_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks to everyone who attended our meeting last night, especially to Jason
Haddix for giving an awesome talk. Also big thanks to AppFolio, for
generously hosting the meetup and providing delicious pizza and beer!

The general consensus is that we'll skip our December meeting -- due to
holidays and end-of-year busyness -- and we'll pick up again in
early-to-mid January. Please keep a lookout on this mailing list and our
MeetUp group for details of the next meeting!

Also, as a reminder, if you're interested in volunteering for AppSec
California, please reach out to Jimmy (jimmy.mesta at owasp.org). It's an
awesome conference, and volunteering is a rewarding experience!

Thanks again for everyone who came out last night. I'm excited to start
planning our next event soon!

David
