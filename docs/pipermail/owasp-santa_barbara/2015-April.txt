I'm developer in SB and saw there is/was a local OWASP group; is it still active and if it is where may I learn more
about it?

 

Respectfully,

Hi Sean, The group is been inactive for somet time now. We struggled with
bringing more presenters to the table and finding a spot to present at
every week. David Shaw is the official leader of the chapter, he might be
able to give you some info as to if there might be a reboot anytime soon :)
