Hi everyone,

As some of you may know, our local chapter in Santa Barbara has never seen
much action, having only one or two events per year since it was founded
back in 2012. A few months ago I decided to take over the leadership, with
the goals of reactivating the chapter, connecting the different local
security groups as one community, and having frequent events where members
could come and share their research and experience, and also learn by doing
hands-on training.

After becoming heavily involved with the planning of AppSec California
<https://appseccalifornia.org/> and making some good progress over the last
couple months, I've finally managed to make some time and organize a
relaunch event for our local chapter, which will take place *next Friday,
Dec 07*.  The opportunity came at the last minute so it won't be anything
big, but we still expect to share some good knowledge and have lots of fun
:)  We have also teamed up with a couple local companies and are already
planning various events for 2019, starting with a CTF event early February.

Hey everyone! Just wanted to thank you all for coming and making this small
relaunch event a success. It was great hanging out with you all and sharing
some good discussions.

Slides from relaunch event (look in the Past OWASP Meetings section):
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Santa_Barbara#tab=Meetings

Remember we have AppSec California <https://appseccalifornia.org> in late
January and our own SB-CTF <https://www.meetup.com/SB-CTF/> event early
February. We'll have a nice group cruising to Santa Monica for the
conference so don't hesitate to contact us to join the SB crew in this fun
trip.

Cheers,
Mart?n.
