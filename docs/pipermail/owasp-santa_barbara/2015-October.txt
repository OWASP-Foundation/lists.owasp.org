Are we supposed to go to the front door of Invoca Office?  It's locked.  Is there another way in?

Hi, there's a free Cybersecurity event hosted by Montecito Bank & Trust,
that will take place on Oct 22nd.  I'm guessing it'll be fairly high level
but it should still be interesting, so I'm planning to attend.  It's free,
you just need to RSVP (tomorrow is the last day) emailing Jamie at
Jperez at montecito.com.

Walter Martin.

Hey guys,

It looks like we'll be good to host the November 19th meeting at AppFolio
-- just figuring out what building/area will work best for us. With the
location nailed down, the next issue we should talk about is what we want
to do for a speaker.

Should we attempt to bring someone in? Video conference someone from
another chapter? Have some local present?

What do you guys think?

I put this on my calendar to attend.  Thanks for resurrecting it.

Presentations are always appreciated, but I?m also interested in discussing a few topics of general interest.
For example, efficient/fast testing of web apps during continuous integration.  Long DAST scans that hold up things up are becoming less tolerable to development/QA.

Best,

-John

I think I presented at almost every single one we've done so far but I have
a cool deck based around vulnerability analysis of bug bounties and how to
augment your application security testing methodology is with this
information, basically better with hacking in 2015 (same talk that was
standing room only at Defcon 23)

Let me know!

John -- I hear you on that one. I think general discussion can also be
useful.

Jason -- I appreciate the effort, and if the group takes you up on it, it
would be much appreciated. That said, though, one of the things we talked
about last meeting was specifically *not* having us few previous presenters
giving talks every time. We have some chapter funds, so we actually have
the ability to fly in speakers and put them up in hotels (although that
might be too-short notice for this next meeting).

Thanks for the responses; let's keep brainstorming what we want to do.
Jason, your offer is absolutely appreciated, and we very well may take you
up on it :)

Hey guys,

The UCSB seclab recently released our binary analysis framework, angr (
http://angr.io). If a presentation is needed, we could definitely talk
about it. Unfortunately, I will be out of town on Nov 19th, but one of the
other core researchers on the project could present.

Hey Yan,

That presentation sounds great!

I'd suggest that this meeting we have Jason present, then next meeting
(either mid-December, or early January if we skip December) you can present
angr.io yourself. If you guys are both open to that, I think that would be
an awesome outcome :)

Thoughts?

Happy Friday!

For those of you planning on attending AppSec California in January, we
have a discount code for paying OWASP members.

The conference is very affordable right now with early bird pricing. This
makes it even better!

Quick note guys -- since we're hosting here at AppFolio, I've been asked to
get an list of attendees so that facilities knows how many people to
expect, that we know it's not unauthorized people running around, etc.

I think the easiest way to do this is just RSVPing via the MeetUp event
that Jimmy set up, located here:
http://www.meetup.com/Santa-Barbara-OWASP-Chapter/events/226345389/

If you're not RSVPed and show up, it's not a big deal -- we're just trying
to make sure physical security and what not is taken care of :) We'll
probably just use a sign in sheet so the facilities guys know what's going
on.

See everyone in a few weeks!
