Subject: [Owasp-santa_barbara] reaching out to local companies
Message-ID: <CAOXDvD8k7eQVXTUYueRDwk77V_E63Orsn7XxUnHkE91dDz+zFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I'm working on reaching out to local companies to see if they'd be
interested in partnering opportunities with OWASP SB.  I'm currently
discussing with people from Lastline, but could definitely use an
introduction to any other companies (e.g. Novacoast) that would potentially
be interested in this opportunity.  The idea is to continue to bring all
the different groups together into one community and continue to share
knowledge, provide networking/recruiting opportunities, and keep having
fund building & breaking stuff.

If you work (or know anyone who works) at a company that would potentially
be interested, please reach out to me directly.

Cheers,
Mart?n.
