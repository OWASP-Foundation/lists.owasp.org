Subject: [Owasp-santa_barbara] FREE TICKETS for AppSec California (next week)
Message-ID: <CAOXDvD_FDhe1RJ1M-pOmJmVJ3PmradPGCPB+__gi_f5O1JMcvw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a couple free tickets for AppSec California, which is happening next
week in Santa Monica.  If you're interested in joining us at this great
conference, please email me directly (do not CC the list) once you've
confirmed you'd be able to attend.  Some of us will be carpooling from SB
as well.

See details at https://2019.appseccalifornia.org

Cheers,
Mart?n
