Subject: [Owasp-santa_barbara] Reminder -- Meet & Greet tonight (with bonus
 tacos!) | Plus: form for those of you who can't make it

OWASP Santa Barbara Members,

Quick reminder that we're having the meet & greet tonight, plus a quick
walk over to some delicious tacos for those who are interested in grabbing
a bite. This should be a short meeting, mostly because we haven't planned
out a lot of the specifics yet--that's our goal for tonight.

Several members are traveling this week or have prior engagements,
including several related to RSA happening in San Francisco this week. Due
to this, I've created a web form that members who can't attend the meet &
greet tonight may use to make sure their thoughts are heard. If you're
attending the meeting, you don't need to bother with the form. The URL is:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zJoK4xHOFDE8rlzAYzMSDUGHW4292gr55J2FBn_4E1o/viewform

Looking forward to some great discussions and the formal kick-off of the
Santa Barbara chapter!

ds
