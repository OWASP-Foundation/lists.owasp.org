Hello OWASP Members,

Our next meeting--the first "real" one, complete with a scheduled
presentation--will take place this coming Monday, April 22nd.

The meeting will start at 7:00pm, but there will be a social half-hour and
hack challenges starting at 6:30pm for those that want to show up early.
Try to arrive before 7:15, as we anticipate the presentation starting
around then.

Although there is no second talk scheduled, we welcome any open discussion,
fire talks, or ideas for future presentations.

This meeting will take place at the PayJunction offices in downtown Santa
Barbara. The address is: 1903 State Street, Santa Barbara, CA 93101.

Hope to see everyone on Monday!
