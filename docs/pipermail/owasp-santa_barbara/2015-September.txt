Tickets are still available.  I'll be driving to SF on Wed morning and back
to SB on Sunday noon.  If anyone is interested in sharing a ride and/or
hanging out while we are there, let me know and we'll plan something out.
Should be an interesting conference.

I'm not going to the conference as the ticket price is too rich for my
blood, but I'll be in SF and happy to meetup, grab drinks, and talk
security.
