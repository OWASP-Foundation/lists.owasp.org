Hi everyone,

I'm happy to announce that I've become the new OWASP SB leader. I have some
cool (and ambitious) plans for the chapter that I'll share with you later,
but OWASP AppSec Cali is coming up pretty soon (Jan 2019) and preparations
have already started. I'm looking for volunteers to represent OWASP SB so
that we can help with this awesome conference and also get some money for
our local chapter (more people/time contributed means more money in our
account, which we can later use to sponsor our own local events / talks /
CTFs).

Volunteers only have to put in a couple hours, and get a free pass for the
conference and also some extra swag. You also get to meet and work with
awesome people from the security community. For those on a low budget, we
could try to book some accommodation as a group (e.g. airbnb) so it ends up
being pretty cheap.  And carpool, of course.

Anyone interested? This is our chance to make a difference and put SB back
on the security map. There's a conference call this Friday afternoon that
all potential volunteers should try to join, and I will provide details to
those interested in volunteering.

Hope to hear from you soon!

Mart?n.
