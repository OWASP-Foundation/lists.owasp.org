Hey All,

I have been contacted recently regarding a few open positions here in
the lower mainland, and can point people in the direction of those
opportunities.

The requirements for all of the positions:
- senior technical app sec skills
- able to perform code review for C/C++, Python, Java on multiple
platforms (linux, windows, mac os)
- ability to evangelize security within an organization

In particular, one of them requires:
- strong native C/C++ code review

Let me know if you are interested!

Cheers,
Yvan Boily

Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] OWASP Vancouver Meeting, Monday, May 28th
Message-ID: <CAD_ZbKx8ishLMVwbN=rD_vUFzdsyBdaa3sET3GNb1vguPH_5HA@mail.gmail.com>

*OWASP Chapter Meeting Announcement*

The next OWASP Vancouver meeting will be held on May 28th, and Mozilla
Vancouver will be our host.  Chris Turra from Mozilla will introduce
our speaker.

*OAuth-based single sign-on in Real-world Implementations*

*Speaker:* San-Tsai Sung

*Date & Time:* Monday, May 28th, 2012 @ 5:30pm

Millions of web users today employ their Facebook accounts to sign
into more than one million relying party (RP) websites. This web-based
single sign-on (SSO) scheme is enabled by OAuth 2.0, a web resource
authorization protocol that has been adopted by major service
providers. The OAuth 2.0 protocol has proven secure by several formal
methods, but whether it is indeed secure in practice remains an open
question. We examine the implementations of three major OAuth identity
providers (IdP) (Facebook, Microsoft, and Google) and 96 popular RP
websites that support the use of Facebook accounts for login.  Our
results uncover several critical vulnerabilities that allow an
attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim user's profile and
social graph, and impersonate the victim on the RP website. Closer
examination reveals that these vulnerabilities are caused by a set of
design decisions that trade security for implementation simplicity. To
improve the security of OAuth 2.0 SSO systems in real-world settings,
we suggest simple and practical improvements to the design and
implementation of IdPs and RPs that can be adopted gradually by
individual sites.
