The Security Spending Benchmarks Project seeks to produce guidance and an
industry accepted benchmark for justifying overall Web application security
spending. We want to quantify how many dollars and human resources should be
allocated towards the software development life-cycle, security training,
security software/tools, independent third-party reviews, Web application
firewalls, etc

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Security_Spending_Benchmarks

This is your call to get involved and take a look.

To: Owasp leaders <owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org>


Hello leaders, I'm really happy to announce a new documentation project I
started today. Our Top 10 most critical web app vulnerabilities is the
standard de facto when trying to summarize findings when you assess a web
application. And it is great.

Looking at source code assessment (or code review, or static analysis, or
whatever the name you want to use :-)), nothing like this exists. Gary
McGraw introduced the 7 kingdoms as taxonomy. I started looking at this
great job extending it to meet Owasp Top 10 like template.
I also used categories that I found useful to gather security code review
findings in.

That's why I started this Top 10 project. The goal is to provide something
useful in Owasp Code Review Guide while trying to organize security issues
and the second goal is to use it as Owasp Orizon default library cookbooks
in order to have a "fil rouge" from Code review guide and the implementing
tool. The Source code flaws Top 10 will be that fil rouge.

I really hope that everyone interested will subscribe to mailing list and
give some contributions to this document I'd like to release as beta quality
project in the next AppSec Europe 2009 in Cracow.

ANNOUNCING THE NEW "OWASP TESTING GUIDE v3

OWASP is announcing the new OWASP Testing Guide v3. The project as
part of the OWASP Summer of Code, started on April 2008 reviewing the
version 2, improving it.
OWASP Testing Guide v3 is a 349 page book; we have split the set of
active tests in 9 sub-categories for a total of 66 controls to test
during the Web Application Testing activity.
Each control has an OWASP name, so for example a SQL Injection is
called: OWASP-DV-005, meaning that it is the 5th control of the Data
Validation category.
We got a dream team of 21 authors and 4 reviewers: after 6 months of
hard work and great team work we realized the v3.

We'd like to ask you to support OWASP to reach the following goals:

*** Continuously improve the guide.
The Guide is a "live" document: we always need your feedback!
Please join our testing mailing list and share your ideas:
http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing

*** Promote the Testing Guide.
We would like to have some more media coverage on the guide, so
please, if you know somebody in there put them in touch.
If you have the chance, you can write an article about the Testing
Guide and the new OWASP Projects.
Also you can pick up the OWASP Testing Guide presentations and talk
about it in local conferences and Chapter meetings.
http://www.owasp.org/images/2/2c/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008_OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3.ppt

*** Add 'quotes' to the Guide.
We made a special 'quotes' pages for the Testing Guide.
Here we'd want to add all the comments and references to the Guide.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_Quotes

The OWASP Testing Guide includes a "best practice" penetration testing
framework which users can implement in their own organizations and a
"low level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques for
testing most common web application and web service security issues.
