Hello

This is just a heads-up regarding some training offerings we have coming up
in 2010. All information is at http://www.wavefrontcg.com/Training.html. The
courses listed below and at the website will take place in Vancouver, BC,
and are all scheduled for April and later to avoid the Olympics.

NOTE: We may also be running our popular 'Secure Web Application
Development and Testing' course in early February (Feb 2-5), just before the
Olympics (the course outline is at
http://www.wavefrontcg.com/IntroWebAppSec_2009a.pdf). We have a few students
lined up already, but need a few more to make the effort viable. Please let
us know ASAP if you are interested.

A list of courses follows:

1) Ethical Hacking, Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessments
Vancouver BC - April 6 - 9 (http://www.wavefrontcg.com/Hacking101_2009a.pdf)

2) Secure Web Application Development and Testing - Vancouver BC - April 20
- 23 (http://www.wavefrontcg.com/IntroWebAppSec_2009a.pdf)

3) Wireless Network Security Complete - Vancouver BC - May 4 - 7
(http://www.wavefrontcg.com/WirelessSec_2009.pdf)

These are all 4-day courses and include a mix of lectures, demos and
workshops / labs, and have been presented annually over several years now.

Thank You
