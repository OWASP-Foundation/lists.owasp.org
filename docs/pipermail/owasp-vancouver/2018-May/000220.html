<PRE> Hey everyone,

A quick reminder that *tomorrow Thursday (May 31st) at 6pm* Roger Trevisan
will present his topic *&quot;Application Security Testing in the modern world:
understanding various methodologies and where they fit in your development
life-cycle&quot;*.

There has been a terrific response to this presentation and there is now a
waitlist!  If you know that you can't attend and have a reservation, please
look to cancel your reservation to allow for others to attend.  Thanks!

*Call for Presenters*
As mentioned in the last email, we are actively looking for individuals to
present at future OWASP sessions (July, September, November).  OWASP
Vancouver is a great way to share your knowledge and experience in a
friendly atmosphere.  As you already know, the community is very supportive
and is a great environment for first time presenters and veteran presenters
alike.

If you are interested in presenting, please feel free to respond back to
this email or reach out to Farshad (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-vancouver">farshad.abasi at miraisecurirty.com</A>).

*Tomorrow's meetup details*
Who - Roger Trevisan
What - Application Security Testing in the modern world: understanding
various methodologies and where they fit in your development life-cycle
When - *Thursday May 31st at 6pm*
Where - *Microsoft Canada, Suite 1100 - 1111 W. Georgia, Vancouver, BC
(FortisBC Centre)*
Why - Because Application Security is awesome!

*Meeting synopsis*
If you are somewhat involved with the application security world, you
probably have heard about some of the following acronyms when talking about
security testing: MPT, SCA, SSA, RASP, IAST, DAST and SAST. With all the
new developments and technologies related to cybersecurity it may be
challenging to understand what solutions are available and the advantages
each of the alternative offers and how do they fit your software
development lifecycle. This session will give you an overview on the most
prevalent security testing technologies and highlight where they fit in the
SDLC.

*Speaker bio*
Roger Trevisan is a CISSP certified security professional with 12+ years of
experience with web application security, secure coding, secure development
lifecycle, penetration testing, risk assessment, vulnerability management,
network security and information systems administration. As a skilled
penetration tester and application security professional, Roger has helped
high-profile companies in industries such as financial, healthcare and
telecommunication to identify and address a large number of critical
security vulnerabilities.

*Sponsor Recognition*
A big thank you to Microsoft for hosting the event.  Without their help, we
wouldn't have been able to accommodate more individuals for this talk and
help our chapter grow.  Thank you!
