Hi All,

The OWASP Security Spending Benchmarks Project has just published its
first quarterly report:

http://www.owasp.org/images/b/b2/OWASP_SSB_Project_Report_March_2009.pdf

The project seeks to set benchmarks for security spending in the
development process. We had 17 partner companies participate and
51respondents. There's more about the project on our project website:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Security_Spending_Benchmarks

Boaz Gelbord thoughts on the results can be found at:

 FYI. They will also be covering SAMM. I have it on good authority that it
won't be a suckup discussion and that OWASP folks may benefit in an
alternative perspective.

     The Building Security in Maturity Model (BSIMM) and Your Software
Security Program

Developed by Fortify and Cigital, the Building Security In Maturity Model
(BSIMM) is meant as a guide for building and evolving a software security
initiative. Based on a study of nine large enterprise software security
programs (including those of Adobe, Depository Trust Clearing Corporation
[DTCC], EMC, Google, Microsoft, QUALCOMM, and Wells Fargo) it identifies key
software security roles, 110 activities in twelve practices, as well as the
ten core activities that all programs studied carry out. Citigal's Sammy
Migues will join analysts Ramon Krikken (SRMS) and Kirk Knoernschild (APS)
to discuss the model, and how it fits security and development practices in
other enterprises.

Presented by: Ramon Krikken

*Web Input Vector Extractor Teaser
<http://code.google.com/p/wivet/>*(WIVET) is a benchmarking project
that aims to statistically analyze web
link extractors. In general, web application vulnerability scanners fall
into this category. WIVET provides a good sum of input vectors to any
extractor and presents the results...

you can send me any other results you have)
http://www.webguvenligi.org/wivet/ (for online use)

WIVET is an OWASP/Turkey project, a local project :)
