The meeting will feature two presentations on PCI compliance and
certification from IPS Networks.  Following the second presentation, we can
open the meeting up for question and answer.

*Speakers*:* Don Bowen, Farrah Smith

**Organizations today are faced with a host of regulatory compliance
requirements, such as PCI, SOX and NERC. It has become increasingly
important for organizations to ensure payment account data security through
compliance with the PCI DSS. Don will attempt to demystify some of the myths
and questions that commonly trouble PCI level 3 and 4 merchants. He will
also discuss why the PCI DSS is necessary and provide an auditor?s
perspective on what is required to achieve compliance through completing a
?Self Assessment Questionnaire?.
*
I am also working to engage speakers on the following topics:

   - OWASP Top Ten
   - Digital Forensics
   - Web Application Firewalls
   - Fuzzers
   - Exploitation Techniques

If you know anyone who is talented in these areas, or have an interest in
participating as a presenter, please let me know, I am happy to work with
anyone in the chapter to help fulfill these requests!

Hi Everyone,

Due to an itchy trigger finder and the need to get the meeting announcement,
unfortunately there were some updated details that didn't make it into the
meeting announcement.  The topic and content remains the same, but the
speakers have changed, and I have corrected the name from IPS Networks to
IPS.  My apologies for the re-posting!

Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] September 23rd meeting
Message-ID: <AANLkTimWTbWPLRHeyMaNnFtXj5pSjpHg28U0RsdjzC9_@mail.gmail.com>

Hi OWASP Vancouver Chapter Members,

I have lined up our speaker for September 23rd meeting, Dana Epp from
Scorpion Software will lead a collaborative session using the Microsoft
Threat Analysis and Modelling Tool.

In order to ensure the best experience for the group, Dana has asked for a
volunteer from the group to step forward to share information about an
application they are developing during the session as the entire group works
with Dana to step through the SDL Threat Modelling process.

This is an excellent opportunity to get an interactive tutorial on how to
use this free tool from Microsoft, and get some valuable insight from a
talented security professional into the threats and risks associated with
your application!  Do we have any volunteers?

Please contact me at yvanboily at gmail.com, or feel free to call me at
604-418-9069 if you are interested!

Regards,
Yvan Boily

Message-ID: <AANLkTim5i13YtsoP+JM_W77sc+iS+_u63LPuzsXVRk2O@mail.gmail.com>

Hi OWASP Members,

I wanted to raise awareness of a new initiative to create a forum for Q&A on
Application Security.

There is a service called Stack Exchange which provides online communities
hosting for StackOverflow Q&A style forums; any community can launch a
proposal and some of the great people at OWASP have created one for
Application Security.  The site has moved out of the definition stage and
into commitment phase; if you think this sort of service would be useful, go
to the site below and indicate wether or not you would use the service.  If
you are not familiar with StackOverflow, then I strongly recommend checking
it out!

We need more people to commit to using the site, and I know that some
extremely talented, top name people in the AppSec field have already
contributed and committed to participation, so this is an opportunity to get
world class talent to focus on the issues you are interested in for free :D

Message-ID: <AANLkTinXFfUPDHQ=snpNwyc6DnLbmcFRunN0eR6Z-3_T@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks to everyone who came out for the August 19th meeting!

Don and Santosh delivered a great presentation on PCI requirements, and have
agreed to answer any further questions.  The sessions was recorded, however
some technical work still needs to be done before the videos will be shared,
thanks in advance for your patience!

Our next meeting is scheduled for September 23rd, where Dana Epp will lead
an interactive session on using the Microsoft SDL tools to threat model a
real world application, using input from the attendees!

One of the big challenges for the OWASP Vancouver chapter is that in order
to bring you interesting content, we need to know what is interesting to
you!

As security practicioners, what content are you interested in?  What do you
want to see speakers discuss?

As a developer, what questions do you have?  What areas do you need help
with?

How can we help the OWASP Vancouver chapter to grow?

I look forward to hearing your feedback, either on or off list!

Regards,

Yvan Boily
