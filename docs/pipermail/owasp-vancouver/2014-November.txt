Hi Folks,

As some of you know I have been involved with OWASP for many years, and I
have been involved with local security community projects in various
aspects.  Unfortunately things have come to a head and I need to prioritize
my involvement -- this is reflected by the fact that I have not stepped up
to organize an OWASP Vancouver chapter meeting in quite some time.

I would like to organize a group of people who will help to organize
meetings, arrange speakers, and work with me to revitalize this chapter,
with the objective of transferring leadership of the Vancouver chapter to a
new leader.

If you are interested, please send me an email off list!

Cheers,
Yvan Boily
