<PRE>Hello

 

We have scheduled the next offering of this 4-day course for May 3-6 

(Tue-Fri) in Vancouver BC.

 

This course aims to provide Web application developers and testers 

(QA) with an understanding of application security issues and attack 

vectors, and the skills, tools and techniques to code defensively 

against web attacks. It also covers techniques and tools for testing 

web application security. Given the nature of the threats from 

hackers and cyber-criminals, having web applications that can take 

the punishment is critical. And if your web applications collect 

personal, private, sensitive, medical, or financial information, you 

have legal and contractual reasons (such as privacy legislation, PCI 

DSS, etc.), to ensure that such information is collected and managed 

securely.

 

This course is aimed at developers; testers/QA staff; system, network,

database and application architects; analysts; system, network and

database administrators; auditors; and security and compliance staff.  

 

This is the sixth year we have run this course and it has been well

attended each time.
