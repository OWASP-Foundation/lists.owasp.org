<PRE>So despite my late arrival, it was a great opportunity to meet people and
get feedback; we had a total of 11 people which was a great turn out to just
talk about a chapter!

We discussed a number of topics, but the majority of the discussion was
around the types of talks to have at the next meeting.

The suggested topics are:


   - Cloud Technology
   - OWASP Top Ten
   - Digital Forensics
   - Web Application Firewalls
   - Fuzzers
   - Exploitation Techniques
   - Risk Assessment Techniques
   - Security Development Lifecycle


If you can suggest other topics, either on or off list, it would be greatly
appreciated!  I am going to begin reaching out to the community to see if I
can find speakers, or if someone wants to volunteer to speak on a topic,
that would be great too!  For the format, I suggest we go with the format we
used in the Winnipeg chapter, which was a 3 hour meeting, 15 minutes
introduction, a 45-60 minute presentation, a 10 minute break, followed by a
second presentation, and then leaving some additional time for discussion.

According to the agenda the next meeting is proposed for Thursday, July 22nd
at 5:30 pm, but I am still working on the location.  I will work with Rui
and Mauro to try and secure a space, and consensus leaned towards a location
downtown.  If you know of a space that you or your company can contribute,
please advise!

In order to promote the chapter, we also need to promote growth of the
membership, and include people who aren't security professionals, we had a
nice turnout of people tonight who asked some very good topical questions
and are very keen.  With the number of large dev shops in town we should be
able to attract alot more participation.

This is the part where I hit you guys up for money!  I strongly encourage
people who can formally join OWASP as a supporter.  This is a small charge
of $50.00 per year, and goes to support the good work of OWASP, and part of
the money goes to support the chapter.  For those of you who work for big
shops, you should also consider approaching your company to buy a corporate
membership as well (these are $5000, but are tax deductable!).

To facilitate expanding group membership, I have started a Facebook Group
called OWASP Vancouver, so those of you who are interested can join!

I look forward to hearing from everyone!

Regards,
Yvan Boily
