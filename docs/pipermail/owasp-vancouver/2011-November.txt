Hi Rui, et. all,

 

I work for the SANS Institute and am responsible for bringing local training
opportunities to Vancouver.  We are having a complimentary presentation and
networking event on December 7 and I would like to personally invite you and
your membership to attend.  Please see below for the invitation which also
includes details of our Vancouver courses.   Is it possible to share this
with your mailing list?  I hope you don't mind that I also requested to join
your mailing list.   I'll be onsite so I look forward to meeting you and to
developing a better relationship with your Chapter.  

 

INVITATION FOR DISTRIBUTION: 

 

You are invited to join SANS and members of your local security community on
Wednesday, December 7th for what promises to be an informative and
interactive evening in conjunction with Community SANS Vancouver
(http://www.sans.org/vancouver-2011-cs-2).

 

Kenton Smith will deliver his exciting presentation, "Wiki-Leaked? Handling
the Insider Threat."  The insider threat is real and is a risk for every
company.  Learn where the risks might lie in your organization and some
ideas to help reduce those risks.

 

SANS is pleased to offer this opportunity to members of local InfoSec
groups, SANS attendees, and members of the security community at large.
