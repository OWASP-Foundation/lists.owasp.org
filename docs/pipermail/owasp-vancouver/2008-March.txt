Hello,

Alessio has put a new version of the OWASP code review tool, Code crawler,
available for download.
It has a totally new look and feel and also runs SQL Server express for the
definitions.
The source is available also. Suggestions on new functionality are welcome.

Code crawler is a complementary tool associated with definitions defined in
the code review guide. It works best using both the guide and tool together.
Remember this is a beta tool, stable, but much functionality to implement.
It can be downloaded from the OWASP code review project site:

To: owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org


Hello everyone,

I had gotten some questions as to whether or not attending an OWASP local
chapter meeting, or conference, counted towards CPE credits for individuals
that have CISSP certification.  I called ISC2, and found out that both the
chapter meetings and conferences can be used to obtain credits.

I would like to ask the chapter leaders to mention this at your next chapter
meeting.  For those individuals that would like to take advantage of this,
they just need to get a certificate signed, and then enter the hours through
the ISC2 website.  I have downloaded the certificate to the website at:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:%28ISC%292_CPE_certification_form.doc

I would suggest that chapter leaders print out a few of these before each
chapter meeting.

Thanks!
