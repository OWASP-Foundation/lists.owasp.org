Just a reminder to the group that OWASP Meetings are open to the public, and
no registration is required to attend.

Since I am arranging for refreshments, I have set up a micro poll to track
how many people are planning to come to gauge how much refreshment to
bring!  The poll does not require registration, and is a simply yes/no
question.

Hi Everyone,

I am pleased to announce the upcoming BSidesVancouver, a Security BSides
conference!

>From the Security BSides Website:
*Each BSides is a community-driven event built for and by information
security community members.  The goal is to expand the spectrum of
conversation beyond the traditional confines of space and time.  It creates
opportunities for individuals to both present and participate in an intimate
atmosphere that encourages collaboration. It is an intense event with
discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. It is where
conversations for the next-big-thing are happening.*

BSides Vancouver will (tentatively) be a 2 day conference starting on
December 3rd.  We are still working to line up sponsors and a venue, but
once that is finished we will lock in the dates and issue the CFP!

More information and updates can be found at:
http://www.securitybsides.com/BSidesVancouver

We are looking for volunteers, sponsors, and participants who want to help
make this event a success!

Regards,
Yvan Boily

Hello,

 

Just thought I'd let you all know that the Vancouver OWASP Chapter Wiki page
has been updated (finally), after a year or so of neglect. Take a look at
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Vancouver. At the moment we are just tracking
the meetings we have held.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikwRCVnqZDUCEsf6e2T_S_p1kzhBj5sYb3VO0Lt@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks to everyone who came out, with 12 people, and some great discussions
on Risk Methodologies and Clouds!

One of the outstanding questions from the meeting was related to Cloud
Hosting and PCI Payment processors:

During my presentation on Cloud Technologies & Risks, one of the attendees
asked about ways of reducing the challenge of getting a payment application
that had to store the full credit card number for recurring transactions.
Unfortunately we didn't have any people well versed in this area; is there
anyone on the list who can speak to PCI certification and Cloud
applications?

I also mentioned the OWASP Testing Guide v4 work that is underway, and the
Application Security stack exchange.
Guide: https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-testing/2010-July/001829.html
Stack Exchange: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/8431

Once I receive the slides from Erasmus I will arrange to have them posted to
the OWASP Vancouver chapter.

Thanks again to Martin Kyle and Sierra Systems for hosting the meeting, and
agreeing to host chapter meetings going forward!

The next meeting is scheduled for October 21st, and we tentatively have a
presenter from IBM to do a technical discussion on application security, but
we can also have another speaker.

Here are the remaining topics that were requested, do we have any volunteers
to do a presentation at the October meeting?

   - OWASP Top Ten
   - Digital Forensics
   - Web Application Firewalls
   - Fuzzers
   - Exploitation Techniques
   - Security Development Lifecycle


Vote for your preferred topic for October 21st here:

Hi Yvan and all,

thank you for great two presentations yesterday!

I'm the one who asked about PCI certification. It would be greatly
appreciated if anyone with an experience in this area would share the
thoughts via a presentation.

Yvan asked me if I want to do it. Sorry, but I'm the one who needs to learn :).

I can't reveal much about the application. The only think I can say at
this point is that we absolutely must store CC information for later
use.

Thank you.

What I have seen done is encrypted value stored in in an sql field.  The key to decrypt was half in the application and half in the registry.  Every time the key needed to be changed the field needed to be updated.  At the time (about two years ago) that was sufficient to pass the audit but I haven't kept up with PCI since then.

If I remember correctly the issue was having more than one of the three values of CC #, Expiry, or CSC/CVC/CVVC persistently stored (including in application, system or web application firewall logs) and none should be communicated in clear text across the internet.  It was suggested that copies in memory should be over written rather than abandoned.  There was also guidance to minimize the number of people (internal employees and such) that could actually see the decrypted information. 

That's what I can remember off the top of my head anyways.

Richard

Hi Rastislav,

I spoke with some of my colleagues in the PCI QSA space today to get some
better insight into this.  I also approached a local PCI QSA, who has agreed
to come to give a presentation on PCI and do some Q&A at the next meeting,
so if your concerns aren't sorted by then, you can ask in October!

Base on conversations today, the model you would want to pursue would be
something like the following:

1. You have a *core *application that manages your customer account, details
about billing cycles, shopping carts, and all the fun stuff except for the
actual payment details.  This application's presentation tier would reside
in your DMZ.

2. You have a separate application which acts as a *repository *that stores
payment card details.  This application must not be exposed to the internet,
and must reside on a separate network (layer 3 isolation) from the
application and servers described in section 1.  Using a secure means, your
core application makes calls to this application to store and retrieve
payment card details associated with an account, and this application
functions by making calls to your payment processor.

Under this scenario, according to two separate QSAs your core application
would not be subject to PCI verification, however you would have to ensure
that the actual credit card is never stored or processed in your core
application.

The other recommendation that was made was to work within your organization
/ with your customers to complete the PCI DSS Self Assessment
Questionnaire.  You can find this at
https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/saq/index.shtml

I hope this clarifies the issue.

Regards,
Yvan Boily

Hi OWASP Vancouver Chapter Members,

Given the success in drawing people for the last two OWASP meetings, and the
growing availability of speakers from the local security community I would
like to move the group to a monthly meeting schedule.  This is six months
ahead of the schedule I proposed at the informal meetup in April, but I
think we have enough people interested to push it forward!

Martin Kyle from Sierra Systems has indicated that we can continue to use
the space at Sierra Systems on a monthly basis, so I propose the following
meeting schedule:

   - August 19th
   - September 23rd
   - October 21st
   - November 25th

Over the next four months we will have speakers on PCI DSS, Threat Modelling
and Tools, Exploitation Techniques, Fuzzing, and Security Development
Lifecycle.  This covers off many of the topics that people have asked about,
but to keep the presentations interesting and continue to build an active
AppSec community, we need to reach out to the community and find out what
people are interested in.

**Ask your friends and colleagues what topics they might be interested in
hearing about; if you have tough questions that are on-topic for the group,
please send them in!  Most of all, we need active participation to make the
chapter a success!

I will send out the August meeting announcement later this week once I
receive confirmation from the speakers.

Regards,
Yvan Boily
