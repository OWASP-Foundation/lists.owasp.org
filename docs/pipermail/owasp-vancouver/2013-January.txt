tumbleweeds.... tumbleweeds everywhere!

There has been little interest in requesting topics or proposing speakers.

I can continue to manage the chapter, but without support from the chapter
members, I will move to a quarterly meeting schedule and aim for a longer
meeting with two speakers every 3 months.

Thoughts?  Feedback?

Cheers,
Yvan Boily
