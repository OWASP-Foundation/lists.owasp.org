<PRE>Hi,


I've been given the opportunity to participate in mentoring this local Burnaby/Vancouver class in Web App Penetration Testing for SANS:

   <A HREF="http://www.sans.org/mentor/class/sec542-burnaby-11sep2013-david-klassen">http://www.sans.org/mentor/class/sec542-burnaby-11sep2013-david-klassen</A>

I have just learned that I can offer a discount, that I didn't know about, which is why I am sharing this with you. I have my own discrepancies about the high prices for education and training, so to be honest I probably would not be sharing this with you personally unless there was a discount that you can benefit from.

In SEC 542 you can learn great information about the pen-test profession as it relates to assessing Web Applications for security concerns, and achieve industry recognized certification. I took this course and learned about quite a few new tools that I hadn't been tracking before, and also more about the history of security and vulnerability research in this space.

I had a fairly large appetite for coming to grips with the real security risks associated with online applications, which is also why I have agreed to help mentor this course. What is nice about SANS Mentor styled courses, is that you can slowly learn the material over a period of 10 weeks(as opposed to 5-6 days), like any normal course offered at a local training educational program.

If you, or someone you know is interested in the content of this course and want to register, feel free to forward this e-mail and Flyer:

When looking to register, talk to me first. Apparently I can offer a discount, that I didn't know about till this week.


Cheers!
