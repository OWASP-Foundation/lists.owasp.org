Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] Secure Web Application Development and Testing -
	Hands-On Training (Vancouver, March 25-28, 2014)
Message-ID: <008001cf0fa9$44658fb0$cd30af10$@com>


Hello

We have scheduled the next offering of this 4-day course for March 25 - 28
(Tuesday-Friday) in downtown Vancouver BC.
 
This course aims to provide Web application developers and testers (QA/QC)
with an understanding of application security issues and attack vectors, and
the skills, tools and techniques needed to code defensively against web
attacks. The course also covers tools and techniques for testing web
application security. Given the nature of the threats from hackers, script
kiddies, cyber-criminals, industrial spies and nation-state agents, having
web applications that can take the punishment without barfing up sensitive
information is critical. If your web applications collect personal, private,
sensitive, medical or financial information, you have legal and contractual
obligations (such as privacy legislation, PCI DSS, CSOX, etc.), to ensure
that such information is collected and managed securely.
 
The course is aimed at developers; testers/QA staff; system, network,
database and application architects; analysts; system, network and database
administrators; auditors; and security and compliance staff.   
 
This is the 8th year we have run this course, and it has been well attended
each time. The course is updated each year to being it up-to-date with new
technologies and attack vectors.
 
A course outline is available at

Hi OWASP Vancouver Folks,

As many of you know, BSidesVancouver is a free, community organized event
that we will be hosting in Vancouver on March 10 and 11th.  While the event
is free, such events are costly to organize, and in order to help us keep
the event vendor neutral we are giving the community the opportunity to
show their support for the event.

Our kickstarter just went live at
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1109583652/bsides-vancouver-2014 and
has some nice rewards at various levels, including the ability to buy
tickets (free ticket registration should be open later this afternoon), and
the option to make a significant contribution and purchase access to BSides
Las Vegas!

Thanks for your support, and any help you can provide in promoting the
kickstarter would be greatly appreciated (via Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn,
and other social media!)

Cheers,
Yvan Boily
BSidesVancouver Co-Founder

Hi All,

Thanks for being patient with the updates!  This morning we added
registration for the Build Your Own Drone session via the kickstarter; this
workshop was added via the kickstarter as those attending the session need
to have the right gear to build their own drone!

For those who don't know, the Build your own Drone session will be led by
Ruan Muller, and for $185 you will finish the workshop with a functional
drone that you can fly around!

In addition, we had several requests for additional Bronze Tickets, so we
added 10 more!
