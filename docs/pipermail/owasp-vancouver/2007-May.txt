Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] Kickoff: Vancouver Chapter of OWASP
Message-ID: <D4B907C84A95D9469D8A292FCF07B15D586AFF@HEXMBVS02.hostedmsx.local>

Folks,

 

I wanted to introduce myself and let you know about activities
associated with the Vancouver OWASP chapter. My name is Neil Rerup and I
have just taken over ownership of the OWASP chapter here in Vancouver. I
own and run a new company that focuses in the Application Security space
and provide Application Security services to large Enterprises around
North America. As a result, I have an inherent interest in Application
Security communications and getting the word out about the importance of
including security in the application development process.

 

As the initiator of the Vancouver Chapter, I wanted to start off by
reaching out to everyone that is presently on the Vancouver OWASP
mailing list and to see who is still receiving these emails. This will
give me an indication of who is active and who is not. Once I have an
idea of who is out there, I was planning to have a initial get-together
with you so that we can introduce ourselves to each other and to begin
the process of growing the Vancouver chapter.

 

So, if you wouldn't mind, could you send me a response email if you are
still interested in being part of OWASP? I'd also like to get a handle
on who is interested in being actively involved in the Vancouver
Chapter. 

 

Thanks and I look forward to hearing back from you ...

Folks,

 

I have only had 2 responses from the list of existing members. I will
make the assumption that the members that have not responded are either
inactive members or that the accounts that last week's email went to
aren't being monitored. 

 

Based on this, I would suggest that we arrange to get together in a
couple of weeks as an informal get together and plan to move ahead with
gathering new members. I am planning on contacting the local chapters of
ISSA, ISACA, and CIPS Security SIG and let them know about our chapter
here (possibly seeing if they can send out a general email to their
members about this chapter). I was wondering if any of you would like to
get involved in an aspect of the Vancouver Chapter of OWASP. Typically,
there would be these areas that need to be dealt with:

 

-          Membership 

-          Communications

-          Website Management

-          Arranging for speakers

-          Treasury

-          Etc.

 

Any one interested in dealing with a specific area? Lots of work to go
around ...

I can look after the web site if no one else steps forward for it.
Considering there are only three of us in total right now, it's
probably safe to say nobody else will?

Message-ID: <D4B907C84A95D9469D8A292FCF07B15D63B5D9@HEXMBVS02.hostedmsx.local>

Folks,

 

I'd like to propose scheduling a meeting for next Wednesday (May 30,
2007) at 5:30pm to 6:30pm. We can use my boardroom in my offices
(located at the corner of Granville and Broadway above the Chapters
Store - #410, 1508 West Broadway Street). If you agree to this time
slot, then let's meet as scheduled. If you would prefer a different
time, let me know.

 

The Agenda would be as follows:

 

-          introduction of each member present

-          goals of the Chapter

-          discussion of direction to meet goals

-          possible future speakers

-          misc.

 

Not a real ambitious agenda since it's our first meeting but since
there's not too many of us, it makes sense to keep it rather informal
and simple. If you want to add anything to the agenda, let me know ...
