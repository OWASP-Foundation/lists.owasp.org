Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] OWASP Vancouver Chapter meeting notes
Message-ID: <BAY129-W32D1373154A7F2FF247BDC81620@phx.gbl>


Hi Everybody,
 
I finally had one hour of reasonably free time to write the meeting notes for the meeting we had in November. I had a couple of very busy weeks :-(.
 
Meeting date: November 29, 2007
Location: Business Objects Main office
Attendance: Rodrigo Carvalho, Rui Perreira, Zenko Turek, Russ Beinder, Mauro Addari
 
The meeting started with an introduction of the OWASP group and its objectives: goals and projects that OWASP is leading. 
There are various open source projects that the OWASP team has been a part of, namely, the OWASP top ten list of vulnerabilities; CLASP ( a guideline for companies to address security issues in their products ); GOAT ( practice your hacking skills on their machines); Web Scarab; plus other scanning/hacking tools. 
 
We then introduced the OWASP Vancouver chapter: lately the chapter has been a little be dormant and all the presents agreed to provide help to revamp the chapter.
The objective of the OWASP Vancouver chapter is to promote web application security and security awareness in the community.
 
In the fall off 2007 the Vancouver chapter reached into the other Vancouver security and technical groups. Some groups as for example SIG Security and Vantug have been interested to hear more about OWASP and the asked for presentations. More presentation can be done to these groups in the next year. We all agree that reaching into Vancouver groups is an important goal for the OWASP Vancouver chapter.
 
Another goal of the group is to facilitate some technical discussion and presentation on the security field. Some of the topics of interest are the following:
 

Honeypot;
Vulnerabilities;
Secure Development LifeCycle;
Hands on seminar using various security/pen tools;
Wireless security;
Http and basic encryption;
Forensic;
Law and enforcement in security;
International security groups like CISSP or SANS.
 
We've also discussed the possibility to promote OWASP in the community and other groups and to capturing new membership through social sites such as Tazzu.com and meetup.com. 
 
The next meeting is planned for the end of January.
 
Please provide comments, thoughts, and additions.
 
Thanks

I suggest you check the presentations from the last conference to see if there are any that might suit your needs.  There are several about OWASP and current projects.  You can find them on the OWASP AppSec Conference page for the San Jose (EBay) conference ? the agenda has been updated with links to all the presentations.

Dear Mauro,
The next VANTUG GM will be on Tuesday, January 22nd, 2008 at Sport BC (1367 West Broadway, Vancouver) - welcome time: 6pm and start time: 6:30pm.
With Vista having been out for about a year and SP1 fairly imminent, it seemed appropriate to get togethor to discuss opinions/experiences. To facilitate that Charlie Russel, MVP has agreed to come along and give a fairly short presentation on various aspects of Vista such as 64 bit vs 32 bit, implementation, app compatability, SP1, etc.. The intention is then to open it up for discussion with Charlie acting as something of a technical resource. So bring your questions and be prepared to take part.
Registration link: http://www.clicktoattend.com/?id=123293
Please note that refreshments WILL NOT be served.
CheersGraham JonesPresident, VANTUG

Dear Mauro,I would like to give you the heads up about a presentation on WHS by Kevin Beares (WHS Community Manager) on Feb 4, 2008 starting at 6:30pm (welcome time 6pm) in the Telus Theatre at the BCIT Burnaby campus. Members of all of the local Microsoft UG's will be invited plus the local community in general. We are aiming for a big attendance to leave a positive impression with Kevin and Redmond. If you are not familiar with WHS and to find out why you should be interested, visit the Microsoft site www.homeserver.com and the blog run by Philip Churchill in the UK www.mswhs.com. I have been in the beta program for several months now and I definitely wouldn't want to give up WHS, if even just for the backup capabilities!! I expect that Kevin will bring some goodies along.I anticipate that the presentation will include some details about the technology behind WHS, info on hardware and demos of the product. If any of you are already using WHS to a major extent I would like to hear from you with details of your usage. If there are good examples, I will approach Kevin about perhaps using the material as examples in the presentation.A reg link and further details will be come when the presentation content has been finalized with Kevin.Also, look for info to come soon on the presentation on Vista by Charlie Russel, MVP in the w/b Jan 21, 2008. Charlie will make a fairly short presentation on a number aspects of Vista, eg. 64 bit vs 32 bit, implementation, app compatability, SP1, etc.. We then want to make it a discussion with as much audience participation as possible. So bring your questions!CheersGraham JonesPresident, VANTUG

From: graham.jones at vantug.com [mailto:graham.jones at vantug.com] Sent: Friday, December 07, 2007 6:01 PMTo: Mauro AddariSubject: VANTUG - Community Launch March 2008
Dear Mauro,
I am quite sure by now that most of you have heard about the upcoming launch for Server 2008, Visual Studio 2008 and SQLServer 2008. The public launch in Vancouver is expected to be sometime in early March 2008. Just like with the Vista, etc. launch this spring there will be a community launch program, which can be delivered after March 17. The program leading up to the community launch is as follows:
Enrollment: Dec 7- Jan 13
?         Access to the Community Launch site, with valuable resources, forums, event readiness guidance and support
?         High Level training available immediately after enrollment
?         Secondary Enrollment: Jan 14 ? Feb 1

Training: Jan 14-March 7
?         A best-of-class virtual train-the-trainer experience
?         Live Q&A with Product Group & Community Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)

Training components:
1. Speaker training and event guidance from MS and Community Experts
2. Deep technical and highly relevant (driven by community feedback and insights)

For the previous launch a few VANTUG members were selected to receive training and to present to the group. We chose to present on all 3 products (Vista, Exchange and Office 2007), which in some respects presented some challenges and limited the scope for each presenter for a single evening event. Again we have 3 products. However, unless I hear wishes to the contrary, on this occasion I propose that we focus on Server 2008. Other local groups, such as PASS and .netBC, will be covering the other products anyway. I am going to try to coordinate with them so that those who wish to explore more than Server 2008 will have the opportunity. There may even be an opportunity for joint metings with people from different groups presenting on different aspects of the same product. However, it is very early days on that.
Many lessons were learned by both the community and Microsoft from the previous community launch event and I have been assured that the experience for those closely involved will be much better this time around. At this point I am looking to hear from those of you who would be willing and able to take part in the training program (see below) and present to the community. If you interested please reply to this email with a description of your background, experience and why you think that you should be considered. Please note that all decsions will be made by the VANTUG Board and are final. We are looking for up to 3 people plus myself. Each person would have the opportunity to take the full course of study but present on a specific topic chosen via discussion within the presentation team.
The Value of being a Heroes {Community} Launch Presenter:
?         Work directly with Microsoft product groups and subject matter experts.
?         Be the first to receive new highly relevant and deeply technical training content for Microsoft Windows Server 2008, Visual Studio 2008, and SQL Server 2008.
?         Participate in live Q & A sessions with Microsoft and community subject matter experts.
?         Receive complimentary Microsoft e-learning courses that focus on the new and enhanced features of Windows Server 2008.
?         Gain access to speaker and presentation training from Microsoft resources and accredited community experts.
?         Access to the Heroes {Community} Launch portal where you can share ideas and success with other Community Launch Leaders worldwide.
?         You will receive a product oriented launch kit to support your event.
?         Community Launch Presenters will receive a recognition and thank you package which will include premium versions of product NFR.

What we are looking for in Heroes {Community} Launch Presenters: 
?        We are looking for people who are eager and able to lead a technical demo and product presentation as part of the launch event. 
?         Individuals who are interested in (and capable of) presenting exclusive training to broader audiences. 
?       People who want to sharpen their speaking and technical presentation skills.

I do not propose to take part in the training myself but will take an organizational role. I wish to emphasize that if you are chosen to take part you must fully commit to the program and see the whole project through unless there are clear extenuating circumstances. So only respond if you are very serious about this. Those who are interested please respond to me by Dec 17.
CheersGraham JonesPresident, VANTUG
