------ INFO --------
Topic: Tracking Protection
Speaker: Francois Marier

Date/time: Wednesday, October 21st, 5:30 PDT
Location: Mozilla Vancouver - 209 - 163 W Hastings St Vancouver, British 
Columbia V6B 1H5 CA

Abstract:
Modern websites include a lot of third-party resources. Some of these 
exist purely for the purpose of tracking users across websites in the 
hope of building a more accurate consumer profile. Firefox 42 will 
introduce built-in protection against tracking and give users the choice 
to opt out of these network requests. Web developers should take care to 
ensure that their sites continue to work when users take an active role 
in protecting their privacy online.

Bio:
Fran?ois Marier is a software engineer working on the Security & Privacy 
team at Mozilla. By day, he works on security features like subresource 
integrity [1] and Safe Browsing [2], as well as privacy features like 
tracking protection [3]. By night, he volunteers for various Open Source 
projects. At the moment, he is working on packaging the Let's Encrypt 
[4] client for Debian.
