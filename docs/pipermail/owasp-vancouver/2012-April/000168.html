<PRE>I really like having this group, and I've noticed there are a few regulars. I like meeting-up to discuss the latest sec news, inside of the scheduled talk occurrences. I am not sure how many people on the list showed up to the BrowserID/SQLi presentations, but they were great.

How many of us went to RSA/CanSecWest or other conferences in the last year, maybe a meeting where we get together and share stuff we learned or witnessed at the conferences etc. A talk/discussion aimed at attack, defense, or even process related issues would be interesting to be a part of for April. 

I'm also thinking it would be neat to have a demo on XSS, with an actual applied attack vector showing a real(or scary) compromise. All the XSS that have been published in the news this year with just the alert box, might be causing our imagination to wain. A presentation going the distance, showing some real compromise of a user session etc. might be a valuable/visual exercise. Perhaps the OWASP Appsec Tutorial is enough (<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z9RQSnf8-g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z9RQSnf8-g</A>), but I would like to see an actual set of Javascript performing something malicious, so the people I am talking to can really get how practical/important the issue is (without having to use their imagination). Of course given that I just started attending 2012, perhaps I've missed out on this same talk from last year? I guess I should just search youtube right?

Myself I have been looking into information on BSIMM/CLASP/SDL models/processes this last year. I know we are more focused on CLASP, but what I think is the most valuable is the widest array of information, because it may have the potential to inform attendees of things they haven't considered (and that is kind of necessary in the security profession). I would be willing to give a talk on what I've learned, but I am still something of a newbie to this kind of religion (less than a year). I don't really have a great network of sec-friends, so I can't really offer to coordinate the meetings. Anyone who has a bunch of connections and could invite/organize new speakers for each month, would be best for this role I think.

Hi All,

I am still looking for speakers or topics for these four months, and
for June and July, I am also looking for someone to help coordinate
the meetings.

If you have some topic that is interesting that:
- you would like to learn more about
- you would like to share your research / experiences with
- you think is interesting to discuss

Please let us know; if you know of a speaker locally that might be
interesting, let me know and I will see if we can get them in!

Cheers,
Yvan Boily
