*Meeting synopsis - 1*
No matter the size of your IT shop, if the first time you think about the
security of the software is during a major incident, it?s not going to go
well. I will teach developers and security teams to prepare for, manage,
and hopefully prevent, application security incidents. Starting with
preparation; do you have a proper application inventory? How do you manage
your technology stack? Disaster Recover? Backup strategy? Do you have a
WAF? Monitoring? Tools that are at the ready when the s* hits the fan?
During an incident; who?s managing the incident? Do you know? What is
triage? Who does the investigation? Do you have a ?safe? place to do
potentially destructive testing? This talk outlines an immediate plan for
the audience to get started, with a list of open source tools the security
team and/or developers will use to ensure that they are ready, for the
worst.

*Speaker bio - 1*
Tanya Janca is a senior cloud advocate for Microsoft, specializing in

teaching via workshops, blogs and community events. As an ethical hacker,
OWASP Project and Chapter Leader, Women in Security and Technology (WIST)
chapter leader, software developer and professional computer geek of 20+
years, she is a person who is truly fascinated by the ?science? of computer
science.

*Meeting synopsis - 2*
Your organization does not have to be breached for you to end up having to
send notification of a data compromise. All it takes is for one of the
millions of websites to lose credentials and your site can be vulnerable,
due to credential stuffing attacks. Attackers have also become very
sophisticated in combining different data sources and attack vectors
(phishing, social engineering, malware, etc) to launch successful attacks,
resulting in account takeovers and data compromise.

*Speaker bio - 2*
Siva Ram is the Head of Security & Fraud risk for commercial banking
digital channels at a global bank. He started off as a developer and has 18
years experience in the security industry. He has been a pentester, PCI/PA
QSA, and currently responsible for protecting mission critical banking
applications against cyber and fraud attacks.


*Call for Presenters for 2019*
As mentioned in the last email, we are actively looking for individuals to

your knowledge and experience in a friendly atmosphere.  As you already
know, the community is very supportive and is a great environment for first
time presenters and veteran presenters alike.  If you are interested in
presenting, please feel free to respond back to this email or reach out to
Farshad (farshad.abasi at miraisecurirty.com).
