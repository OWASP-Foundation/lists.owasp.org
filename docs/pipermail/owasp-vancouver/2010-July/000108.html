<PRE>Thanks to everyone who came out, with 12 people, and some great discussions
on Risk Methodologies and Clouds!

One of the outstanding questions from the meeting was related to Cloud
Hosting and PCI Payment processors:

During my presentation on Cloud Technologies &amp; Risks, one of the attendees
asked about ways of reducing the challenge of getting a payment application
that had to store the full credit card number for recurring transactions.
Unfortunately we didn't have any people well versed in this area; is there
anyone on the list who can speak to PCI certification and Cloud
applications?

I also mentioned the OWASP Testing Guide v4 work that is underway, and the
Application Security stack exchange.

Stack Exchange: <A HREF="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/8431">http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/8431</A>

Once I receive the slides from Erasmus I will arrange to have them posted to
the OWASP Vancouver chapter.

Thanks again to Martin Kyle and Sierra Systems for hosting the meeting, and
agreeing to host chapter meetings going forward!

The next meeting is scheduled for October 21st, and we tentatively have a
presenter from IBM to do a technical discussion on application security, but
we can also have another speaker.

Here are the remaining topics that were requested, do we have any volunteers
to do a presentation at the October meeting?

   - OWASP Top Ten
   - Digital Forensics
   - Web Application Firewalls
   - Fuzzers
   - Exploitation Techniques
   - Security Development Lifecycle


Vote for your preferred topic for October 21st here:
