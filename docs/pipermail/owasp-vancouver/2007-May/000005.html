<PRE>Folks,

 

I wanted to introduce myself and let you know about activities
associated with the Vancouver OWASP chapter. My name is Neil Rerup and I
have just taken over ownership of the OWASP chapter here in Vancouver. I
own and run a new company that focuses in the Application Security space
and provide Application Security services to large Enterprises around
North America. As a result, I have an inherent interest in Application
Security communications and getting the word out about the importance of
including security in the application development process.

 

As the initiator of the Vancouver Chapter, I wanted to start off by
reaching out to everyone that is presently on the Vancouver OWASP
mailing list and to see who is still receiving these emails. This will
give me an indication of who is active and who is not. Once I have an
idea of who is out there, I was planning to have a initial get-together
with you so that we can introduce ourselves to each other and to begin
the process of growing the Vancouver chapter.

 

So, if you wouldn't mind, could you send me a response email if you are
still interested in being part of OWASP? I'd also like to get a handle
on who is interested in being actively involved in the Vancouver
Chapter. 

 

Thanks and I look forward to hearing back from you ...

 

Neil Rerup
