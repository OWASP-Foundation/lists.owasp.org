<PRE>Hello

 

We have scheduled the next offering of this 4-day course for 

February 28 to March 2, 2012 (Tuesday-Friday) in Vancouver BC.

 

The course aims to provide Web application developers and testers 

(QA) with an understanding of application security issues and attack 

vectors, and the skills, tools and techniques needed to code 

defensively against web attacks. It also covers techniques and tools 

for testing web application security. Given the nature of the threats 

from hackers and cyber-criminals (Sony, anyone?), having web 

applications that can take the punishment is critical. And if your web 

applications collect personal, private, sensitive, medical, or financial 

information, you have legal and contractual reasons (such as privacy 

legislation, PCI DSS, etc.), to ensure that such information is 

collected and managed securely.

 

The course is aimed at developers; testers/QA staff; system, 

network, database and application architects; analysts; system, 

network and database administrators; auditors; and security and 

compliance staff.   

 

This is the seventh year we have run this course, and it has been 

well attended each time. The course is brought up-to-date each 

year.
