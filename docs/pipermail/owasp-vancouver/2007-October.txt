Howdy Folks,

 

My apologies for not getting back to everyone but I've been in Toronto
for the last several weeks. I understand from Mauro that a number of you
have expressed interest in the OWASP chapter here in Vancouver. I will
get back to you in the next several days about scheduling a meeting for
everyone interested in the OWASP chapter. In the meantime, if you have
any questions, please feel free to contact me at 604-948-9326. Thanks
and I'll talk to you shortly ...

 

Regards,

 

Neil Rerup
