OWASP Vancouver:  This is my first time posting to your organization, but I
felt it would be appropriate:  Our client is an  East Coast based consulting
firm and is looking to build their West Coast practice.  The area of focus
is software security.  A lot of their business will be in the Bay Area, but
they will also be doing business in southern, CA, Canada, and possibly
Texas.  They are looking to hire 3 - 5 candidates at a variety of levels.  I
have attached the job descriptions, but have additional information on each
position.  Please e-mail me with interest or possible referrals.  Thank You.

I think the OWASP "policy" (don't you just love that word!) is to allow
these job postings... As long as they are relevant etc. Of course, if
owasp-vancouver does not want them, that's a different story.

And why not - these could be good opportunities for some people? Just
don't try to sell anything.

BR,

Mikko
