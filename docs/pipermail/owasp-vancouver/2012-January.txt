Hello

 

We have scheduled the next offering of this 4-day course for 

February 28 to March 2, 2012 (Tuesday-Friday) in Vancouver BC.

 

The course aims to provide Web application developers and testers 

(QA) with an understanding of application security issues and attack 

vectors, and the skills, tools and techniques needed to code 

defensively against web attacks. It also covers techniques and tools 

for testing web application security. Given the nature of the threats 

from hackers and cyber-criminals (Sony, anyone?), having web 

applications that can take the punishment is critical. And if your web 

applications collect personal, private, sensitive, medical, or financial 

information, you have legal and contractual reasons (such as privacy 

legislation, PCI DSS, etc.), to ensure that such information is 

collected and managed securely.

 

The course is aimed at developers; testers/QA staff; system, 

network, database and application architects; analysts; system, 

network and database administrators; auditors; and security and 

compliance staff.   

 

This is the seventh year we have run this course, and it has been 

well attended each time. The course is brought up-to-date each 

year.

Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] OWASP Session Tonight
Message-ID: <CAD_ZbKyYX9XJfww7BEAjXV9JNeJa5GjwTUGZb6Hy11BPBK6SqQ@mail.gmail.com>

I just have to say that was one of the best OWASP meetings and chapter
turnouts since I have been a part of OWASP in Vancouver!

Thanks to everyone who came out, and thanks for the great discussion!

It sounds like in the next couple of months we have the following lined up:

The meeting announcement for February will be out soon, and hopefully we
can build some momentum.

Remember that you can invite and promote the chapter with your friends and
colleagues, and our goal is the build a vibrant community to reach as many
interested people as possible!

I will be attempting to coordinate a talk on WebDriver (a browser test
automation framework) in coming months, and we have someone who is going to
present on security in Python apps as well.

If you have ideas for a presentation you would like to see, or one you
would like to give, we strongly encourage you to get engaged!

Cheers,
Yvan Boily
