Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] FW: Secure Web Application Development and
	Testing - Training
Message-ID: <011f01caca02$2e1bf550$8a53dff0$@ca>

Hello

 

We have scheduled the next offering of this 4-day course for April 20 - 23
(Tue-Fri) in Vancouver BC. 

 

This course aims to provide Web application developers and testers (QA) with
an understanding of application security issues and attack vectors, and the
skills, tools and techniques to code defensively against web attacks. It
also covers techniques and tools for testing web application security. Given
the nature of the threats from hackers and cyber-criminals, having web
application that can take the punishment is critical. And if your web
applications collect personal, private, sensitive, medical, or financial
information, you have legal and contractual reasons (such as PCI DSS), to
ensure that such information is collected and managed as securely as
possible.

 

The course is aimed at developers; testers/QA staff; system, network,
database and application architects; analysts; system, network and database
administrators; auditors; and security and compliance staff.   

 

This is the fifth year we have run this course and it has been well attended
each time.

 

A course outline is available at
http://www.wavefrontcg.com/IntroWebAppSec_2009a.pdf.

 

Other training offerings are listed at
http://www.wavefrontcg.com/Training.html. 

 

Thank You

It has been quite some time since any significant discussion has occured on
this list; are there any plans to host another meeting?  If not, perhaps it
would it be a good time to have a less formal meeting at a conveniently
located coffee shop or pub to discuss the future of OWASP in Vancouver.

Given the presence of some very talented people locally, and the strong
presence from a number of large organizations in the lower mainland, I am
surprised that there is not more activity.

If you are interested, please respond, on or off-list!

Cheers,
Yvan Boily

So the only remaining question is Coffee or something a little more
sturdy for this informal discussion ;)

How about Monday the 22nd at 4:30?  Does downtown or near Broadway and
Commercial work for people?

Cheers,
Yvan

22/4 would work for me - I'm teach a web application security course that
week downtown, so depending on where we meet, I could probably make 4:30pm.

I was at the OWASP DC conf. last November, so we could chat a little about
that.

I would be interested and as I am coming from Victoria downtown would be OK.  Do you plan to have all arrangements via this list or to create a short list for just those that express interest?

Ok, April 22nd seems to work well.  I think we should keep it on list; if
any of the list organizers want to make it more formal and coordinate a
space they can.  In the meantime, I suggest Steamworks as it is close to a
sky-train station, and has food/drinks for those who might be interested.

Hi David,

Wow, that really is a question for your lawyer!  It really depends on to
what degree you are a party to the CA between your client and the vendor,
and the degree of liability that is transferred to you via the third party
agreement between you and your client.  For the rest of this email, read it
with the following in mind:

A) I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice.
*B) I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice.*

You could contact the original vendor and advising them of the issue, in
writing.  Suggest that they investigate the issue and request a follow-up
discussion within 5 days.  Include a reference to and summary of a
responsible disclosure policy[1], and your willingness to work with them to
ensure that their customers are protected.  Stress that your concern here is
protecting the vendors customers, and the fact that for those websites which
process credit cards, they are not in compliance with their service
providers.

Above all, be sure to make them aware that you are formally notifying them
of the issue (and include each of the issues you have identified!).  Advise
them that you have already invested time and effort into this, and _do_not_
proceed with any other testing or research against the targets while you are
negotiating the time frame and handling the disclosure.  If they ask you to
do additional work or testing, ensure that you have written authorization
from both the vendor and the owner of the affected site.

In keeping with the policy I refer to below, the objective should be to
facilitate their work to address the issue with the carrot of the free work
you have already done, and the stick of disclosure if they do not respond.
Stress that you are not looking for remuneration for services in notifying
them of these issues.  Reject any offers of payments, and frame your
responses as a request to define scope for future engagements should this
issue be resolved in a satisfactory fashion [it is important to clarify that
they are asking you for further assistance, and that for any future work,
you need to discuss terms].

Beyond that, if they don't respond, follow through.  Pick a customer, notify
them of the issue.  Work with the customer to help them deal with it. It is
acceptable to use this as a foundation for future paying work, but is
generally viewed as extortion if this assistance isn't granted as part of
the disclosure cycle.

Thanks so much for the excellent response.   Once my client finishes
suing the vendor for failing to deliver I think I will follow the
course of action you laid out.

I actually don't want to do any of the work to renovate any of the
affected sites.  I have seen this companies work and there is no way I
would attempt to patch the existing code because it is such low
quality.  So I might just alert their customers in the manner of a
helpful passerby who just happened to notice that they forgot to lock
their car doors.

See you for drinks.

Skipfish is an open source web application scanner that has some interesting
performance benefits.

http://code.google.com/p/skipfish/

I haven't tested it extensively yet, but it has nice results for some basic
stuff.  I will seek permission to use it in an upcoming cycle of IBM Portal
tests to compare results to other tools.

Cheers!
