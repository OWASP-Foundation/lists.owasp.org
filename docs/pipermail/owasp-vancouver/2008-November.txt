Dear members of the Vancouver OWASP chapter,

It has been almost a year since we last met at the very interesting
presentation from Michael Weider, Founder and CTO of IBM Watchfire.

I am planning to have another presentation and chapter meeting in January: I
am thinking January 14 at 5:00 p.m. or January 20 at 6:00 p.m.

I' would like to have a reply to this e-mail with your interest in attending
the presentation and your preference for the date. *If you can send me an
e-mail even if you cannot attend either of the dates, I would appreciate,
since this will alllow me to verify how many e-mail addresses are still
valid.*

Thank you in advance for your time and interest in the OWASP Vancouver
Chapter.
