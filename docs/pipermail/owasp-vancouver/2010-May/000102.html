Also 2nd reminder/FYI, re Vancouver Tech-Security Conference May 20th (not a
CIPS-SIG event).

A security technology mini-trade show for security professionals. May
20, 8:15 am-4 pm, Plaza 500 Hotel, Vancouver.
Most of the vendors and presenters are from the US Pacific Northwest.
I believe this is the second time Data Connector organized this outreach
event in Vancouver, I attended last year's event, not bad.
Interesting to note the difference in interpretation of privacy laws
between Canada and US.
