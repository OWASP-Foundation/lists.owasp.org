Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] OWASP Vancouver in 2011
Message-ID: <AANLkTimL4h3yPp4MAGbYhfRbEW5CRWNoN0i4UB+wavnk@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All,

I am ringing in the new year with a new job, and more opportunities to
participate in doing presentations and doing more for the local InfoSec
community.  Next Tuesday we will be having the first meeting for the
BSidesVancouver planning group; if you are interested, head over to
http://groups.google.com/group/bsidesvancouver and sign up!

In addition I am working to line up speakers for the new year; I will be
delivering a physical security related presentation, but it won't have much
in the way of Web App content.  In addition, I am preparing longer
presentation which is a walk through of the compromise of a web-application,
detecting the compromise, and cleaning up the affected host.  That
presentation should be delivered in January or February for a local user
group, and will be re-executed for the OWASP chapter if there is interest.

I am calling on you as members of the list to share ideas for content you
would like to see, or to nominate ideas for presentations into the new year,
so if there is anything you are interested in, please let me know.

Some other ideas:
- Spend 2-3 meetings in a workshop format, looking specifically at issues
and how specific technology stacks can be used to prevent them in common
platforms
- look at OWASP technologies, with a focus on practical usage
- demos of tools like O2 and Agnitio to go from theory into practice for
static and dynamic analysis

I look forward to hearing from you!
