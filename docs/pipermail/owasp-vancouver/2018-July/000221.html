<PRE> Hey everyone,

A quick reminder that *next week Thursday (July 26th) at 6pm* Yvan Boily
will present his topic *&quot;What you need to know about Web Application
Firewalls (WAF)&quot;*.

There are still some spots open, so please register before there is a
waitlist!

*Meetup details*
Who - Yvan Boily
What - What you need to know about Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
When - *Thursday June 26th at 6pm*
Where - *ACL 13th floor - 980 Howe Street, Vancouver, BC*
Why - Because Application Security is awesome!

*Meeting synopsis*
Join Yvan Boily for an overview of WAF technologies, how they can be
deployed to protect your application and organization, their weaknesses and
strengths, and learn how you can use FTW and other tools to test the
effectiveness of your firewall.

*Speaker bio*
Yvan Boily has been working in IT Security for more than 15 years in the
government and finance sector.  Previously the chapter lead for OWASP and a
co-founder of BSidesVancouver and MARS, Yvan Boily is currently working
with Fastly as a Security Researcher.

*Call for Presenters*
As mentioned in the last email, we are actively looking for individuals to
present at future OWASP sessions (September, November, January).  OWASP
Vancouver is a great way to share your knowledge and experience in a
friendly atmosphere.  As you already know, the community is very supportive
and is a great environment for first time presenters and veteran presenters
alike.

If you are interested in presenting, please feel free to respond back to
this email or reach out to Farshad (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-vancouver">farshad.abasi at miraisecurirty.com</A>).

*Sponsor Recognition*
A big thank you to ACL for hosting the event.  Without their help, we
wouldn't have been able to accommodate more individuals for this talk and
help our chapter grow.  Thank you!
