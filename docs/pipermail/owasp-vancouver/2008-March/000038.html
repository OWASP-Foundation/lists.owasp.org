to financially sponsor contributions to OWASP Projects. SoC 2008
   follows the previous OWASP Spring of Code
2007&lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Spring_Of_Code_2007">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Spring_Of_Code_2007</A>&gt;,

   in which 9 projects were sponsored with a budget of $20,000.


   - The SoC 2008 is an open sponsorship program were
   participants/developers are paid to work on OWASP (and web security) related
   projects.


   - The SoC 2008 is also an opportunity for external individual or
   company sponsors to challenge the participants/developers to work in areas
   in which they are willing to invest additional funding, provided that these
   areas are relevant and beneficial to the OWASP community.


   - The initial Budget for SoC 2008 will be $100,000 and it is funded by
   OWASP using current membership fees and profits from past conferences. In
   parallel with the Request for Proposals, OWASP would like to invite
   individuals and companies that benefit from OWASP projects to join OWASP as
   a member. In addition to the current Membership benefits, the new OWASP
   members will be able to allocate membership fees to SoC 2008 projects they
   are interested in.


   - There is no geographical, age or any other form of restrictions to
   who can apply for an &quot;OWASP Summer of Code 2008&quot; sponsorship. The only
   requirement is that the candidate shows the potential to accomplish the
   project's objectives and the commitment to dedicate the time required to
   complete it in the allocated time frame (projects must be completed by 30th
   August 2008).


   - Prospective candidates should visit SoC 2008
