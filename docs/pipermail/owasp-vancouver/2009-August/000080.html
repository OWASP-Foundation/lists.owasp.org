Hello

We have scheduled a presentation of our 4-day &quot;Secure Web Application
Development and Testing&quot; course in VANCOUVER BC from September 29 through
October 2, 2009 (Tuesday to Friday). This would be the fifth year this
course has been presented. More information is available online at
<A HREF="http://www.wavefrontcg.com/IntroWebAppSec_2009a.pdf.">http://www.wavefrontcg.com/IntroWebAppSec_2009a.pdf.</A>   

Course: Secure Web Application Development and Testing
Dates: September 29 - October 2, 2009 (4 days)
Location: Vancouver (downtown)
Course Outline: <A HREF="http://www.wavefrontcg.com/IntroWebAppSec_2009a.pdf">http://www.wavefrontcg.com/IntroWebAppSec_2009a.pdf</A>      
Instructor: Rui Pereira, CISSP, CISA, CPTS/CPTE, CWNA/CWSP

A brief summary follows...

&quot;This 4-day course aims to provide web application developers with an
understanding of application security issues and attack vectors (XSS, 
SQL Injection, Broken Access Control, Forced Browsing, etc.), and the 
skills necessary to code defensively against web attacks. We will show 
how hackers can abuse web applications, and what developers can do to
prevent this. In addition, we show how developers and testers can test
their own applications in order to determine if they are susceptible 
to web application attacks. The material would also be of interest for 
software testers (QA); system, network and database administrators;
software, network and system architects; Information Security personnel; 
and Compliance Officers (Privacy, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.)

For PCI DSS compliance it is critical that web applications which handle
credit card information are developed securely. It is also necessary to
prove that such applications are indeed secure by testing for various 
web application security vulnerabilities.&quot;

If you know of anyone else who may benefit from this training, please pass
this information on to them. 

To be removed from this mailing list please reply with the word &quot;REMOVE&quot;
added to the subject line.

Thank You
