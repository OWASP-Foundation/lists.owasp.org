Hi OWASP Vancouver members and subscribers,

As some of you may recall, I am interested in launching the
SecurityBSides conference here in Vancouver.  I also vastly
over-estimated how much time I would have leading into the fall and I
no longer think the December time is feasible.

If people are interested in helping to organize, please contact me on
or off list.  On the weekend I will send an email out to the people
who are interested in helping to organize to coordinate an initial
meetup so that we can get this moving.

Thanks in advance!

Yvan Boily

*OWASP Chapter Meeting Reminder*

I am pleased to announce the next OWASP Vancouver meeting!  As previously
announced on the mailing list, we will have the meeting on September 23rd,
and Sierra Systems is once again hosting our meeting.

This month we have Dana Epp from Scorpion Software who will lead the group
in performing a threat model of an application using the Microsoft SDL
Threat Modeling process and tools!  This session is an interactive session
that will provide an opportunity for the attendees to participate as well as
learn how to use this free and powerful process and tool from Microsoft.

OWASP Vancouver meetings are open to all that are interested in learning
about security, so if you have a friend or colleague in the security or
development community that you think might be interested, please share this
invite with them!

*Call for Volunteer:* We are still looking for a volunteer to offer an
application for threat modeling!  This is an opportunity to learn how this
tool and process can be applied directly to your development cycle and
business!  If you are interested in volunteering your application for this
session, please let me know!

Please confirm attendance by voting at

Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] Application Security Role
Message-ID: <AANLkTikWZv0fZRnhP00ySvJBDXW_rWYS1HvvX5hNv-uC@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Group,

Yet more job spam.  I have been asked if I can recommend any people in
the application security space for a position in the interior.  It
would require relocating to Kelowna, and the role has significant
opportunity for advancement in a large organization.

The role will include both security architecture requirements and
security testing work.  The position is not publicly listed currently,
and I was asked by a former colleague to recommend people, so if you
are strong in this place and interested in a move, please let me know.

If you express interest in the position, please send me an email
off-list with a brief background and your contact information.  You
will need to authorize me to share your contact information with my
colleague and they will contact you, but nothing you share with me
other than your contact information will be shared with the hiring
manager.

Disclaimer: there is no financial motivator for me on this, I am
trying to help a former colleague to fill a gap in their team.

Regards,
Yvan Boily
