Just a quick heads-up that ticket sales for Vancouver Python Day will end
on Tuesday November 12, at 11:55PM.

If you have been thinking of attending but have not yet purchased a ticket,
get one now at http://vanpyday.eventbrite.ca/

Thank you to all who have already purchased tickets. We really appreciate
your support.

Thanks also to our sponsors -- A Thinking Ape, OpenRoad Communications, and
Mobify -- for making it possible for us to offer conference tickets at an
amazingly low price.
