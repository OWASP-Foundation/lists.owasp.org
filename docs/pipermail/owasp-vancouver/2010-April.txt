I have reserved a space for Steamworks for April 22nd at 5:30 pm for 10
people based on the number of people that have responded to me, on and off
list.  I will increase the size of the reservation as required!

I will also be forwarding this time and location to a number of personal and
professional contacts to encourage attendance.  If you know other people who
will be attending, please include a headcount and submit it to me prior to
Friday, April 16th.  If you have received this email, and you are not one of
the original recipients, please feel free to respond to me with the number
of people you expect to attend, but also include "OWASP" in the subject to
ensure that I see it.

An agenda will be circulated to the list, and directly to those who have
contacted me off-list.

Cheers, and I look forward to meeting some new people on April 22nd!

Message-ID: <r2icef895b01004151001sa698be1z495e4bf868e8b8a3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Group,

I have sent emails to the 12 individuals that have indicated that they plan
to event next weeks event; if you have not received an email off-list, but
plan to attend, please let me know ASAP so that I can increase the
reservation.

We are planning an informal meeting to introduce ourselves, and to guage
interest in relaunching the Vancouver chapter.

Steamworks is located 375 Water Street in downtown Vancouver, close to
Waterfront station on the skytrain.
http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&q=375+water+street+vancouver+bc&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=375+Water+St,+Vancouver,+Greater+Vancouver+Regional+District,+British+Columbia&z=16

Please be advised that this is not a formal OWASP meeting, and was
originally planned to guage interest in relaunching the Vancouver chapter,
so attendees are responsible for their own food and drink!

I look forward to meeting all of you!

Hey everyone, just a final reminder that we are good to go for Steamworks
tomorrow evening.  We have a reservation for 14, as that is the number of
confirmed people at this point.

I look forward to meeting all you tomorrow, and hopefully we can get a
strong chapter going!

If you did not receive the reminder last week to you, or did not receive a
personal note indicating that you have been counted, please send me an email
before OED today so that I can up the reservation.

Cheers!

Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] OWASP Meeting at Steamworks Pub
Message-ID: <g2pcef895b01004222118lf7d8b8d6r50c281ed071a72bd@mail.gmail.com>

So despite my late arrival, it was a great opportunity to meet people and
get feedback; we had a total of 11 people which was a great turn out to just
talk about a chapter!

We discussed a number of topics, but the majority of the discussion was
around the types of talks to have at the next meeting.

The suggested topics are:


   - Cloud Technology
   - OWASP Top Ten
   - Digital Forensics
   - Web Application Firewalls
   - Fuzzers
   - Exploitation Techniques
   - Risk Assessment Techniques
   - Security Development Lifecycle


If you can suggest other topics, either on or off list, it would be greatly
appreciated!  I am going to begin reaching out to the community to see if I
can find speakers, or if someone wants to volunteer to speak on a topic,
that would be great too!  For the format, I suggest we go with the format we
used in the Winnipeg chapter, which was a 3 hour meeting, 15 minutes
introduction, a 45-60 minute presentation, a 10 minute break, followed by a
second presentation, and then leaving some additional time for discussion.

According to the agenda the next meeting is proposed for Thursday, July 22nd
at 5:30 pm, but I am still working on the location.  I will work with Rui
and Mauro to try and secure a space, and consensus leaned towards a location
downtown.  If you know of a space that you or your company can contribute,
please advise!

In order to promote the chapter, we also need to promote growth of the
membership, and include people who aren't security professionals, we had a
nice turnout of people tonight who asked some very good topical questions
and are very keen.  With the number of large dev shops in town we should be
able to attract alot more participation.

This is the part where I hit you guys up for money!  I strongly encourage
people who can formally join OWASP as a supporter.  This is a small charge
of $50.00 per year, and goes to support the good work of OWASP, and part of
the money goes to support the chapter.  For those of you who work for big
shops, you should also consider approaching your company to buy a corporate
membership as well (these are $5000, but are tax deductable!).

To facilitate expanding group membership, I have started a Facebook Group
called OWASP Vancouver, so those of you who are interested can join!

I look forward to hearing from everyone!

Regards,
Yvan Boily

During the meeting I mentioned the following stuff and offered links:

http://cansecwest.com/ <-- really great local conference
http://www.backtrack-linux.org/ <-- really great linux distro

I am also on Twitter @ygjb , but that is a new thing, and may abandon it and
return to various IRC networks because I am a curmudgeon (*shakes fist at
new fangled services*)

Please update http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Vancouver

Most of local people know vancouver chapter from this webpage. It's
still 2008 information, and people will be confused that this chapter
is actvie or not.

Thanks.
