Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] Secure Web Application Development and Testing -
	Hands-On Training (Vancouver, March 17-20, 2015)

Hello, and pardon this brief intrusion into your mailbox...

 

We have scheduled the next offering of this four-day course for March 17 -
20 (Tuesday-Friday) in downtown Vancouver BC.

This course aims to provide Web application developers and testers (QA/QC)
with an understanding of application security issues and attack vectors, and
the skills, tools and techniques needed to code defensively against web
attacks. The course covers tools and techniques for testing web application
security. Given the nature of threats from hackers, script kiddies,
cyber-criminals, industrial spies and nation-state agents, having web
applications that can take the punishment without barfing up sensitive
information is critical. If your web applications collect personal, private,
sensitive, medical or financial information, you have legal and contractual
obligations (such as privacy legislation, PCI DSS, CSOX, etc.), to ensure
that such information is collected and managed securely.

 

If your organization has to meet Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards, then
this training is a requirement for compliance, and has been approved by
several QSA's as meeting the PCI requirements. 

 

This course is aimed at developers; testers/QA staff; system, network,
database and application architects; analysts; system, network and database
administrators; auditors; and security and compliance staff.   

 

This is the 10'th year we have run this course, and it has been well
attended each time. The course is updated each year to bring it up-to-date
with new technologies and attack vectors.
