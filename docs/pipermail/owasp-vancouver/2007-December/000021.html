Dear Mauro,
I am quite sure by now that most of you have heard about the upcoming launch for Server 2008, Visual Studio 2008 and SQLServer 2008. The public launch in Vancouver is expected to be sometime in early March 2008. Just like with the Vista, etc. launch this spring there will be a community launch program, which can be delivered after March 17. The program leading up to the community launch is as follows:
Enrollment: Dec 7- Jan 13
&#183;         Access to the Community Launch site, with valuable resources, forums, event readiness guidance and support
&#183;         High Level training available immediately after enrollment
&#183;         Secondary Enrollment: Jan 14 &#8211; Feb 1

Training: Jan 14-March 7
&#183;         A best-of-class virtual train-the-trainer experience
&#183;         Live Q&amp;A with Product Group &amp; Community Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)

Training components:
1. Speaker training and event guidance from MS and Community Experts
2. Deep technical and highly relevant (driven by community feedback and insights)

For the previous launch a few VANTUG members were selected to receive training and to present to the group. We chose to present on all 3 products (Vista, Exchange and Office 2007), which in some respects presented some challenges and limited the scope for each presenter for a single evening event. Again we have 3 products. However, unless I hear wishes to the contrary, on this occasion I propose that we focus on Server 2008. Other local groups, such as PASS and .netBC, will be covering the other products anyway. I am going to try to coordinate with them so that those who wish to explore more than Server 2008 will have the opportunity. There may even be an opportunity for joint metings with people from different groups presenting on different aspects of the same product. However, it is very early days on that.
Many lessons were learned by both the community and Microsoft from the previous community launch event and I have been assured that the experience for those closely involved will be much better this time around. At this point I am looking to hear from those of you who would be willing and able to take part in the training program (see below) and present to the community. If you interested please reply to this email with a description of your background, experience and why you think that you should be considered. Please note that all decsions will be made by the VANTUG Board and are final. We are looking for up to 3 people plus myself. Each person would have the opportunity to take the full course of study but present on a specific topic chosen via discussion within the presentation team.
The Value of being a Heroes {Community} Launch Presenter:
&#183;         Work directly with Microsoft product groups and subject matter experts.
&#183;         Be the first to receive new highly relevant and deeply technical training content for Microsoft Windows Server 2008, Visual Studio 2008, and SQL Server 2008.
&#183;         Participate in live Q &amp; A sessions with Microsoft and community subject matter experts.
&#183;         Receive complimentary Microsoft e-learning courses that focus on the new and enhanced features of Windows Server 2008.
&#183;         Gain access to speaker and presentation training from Microsoft resources and accredited community experts.
&#183;         Access to the Heroes {Community} Launch portal where you can share ideas and success with other Community Launch Leaders worldwide.
&#183;         You will receive a product oriented launch kit to support your event.
&#183;         Community Launch Presenters will receive a recognition and thank you package which will include premium versions of product NFR.

What we are looking for in Heroes {Community} Launch Presenters: 
&#183;        We are looking for people who are eager and able to lead a technical demo and product presentation as part of the launch event. 
&#183;         Individuals who are interested in (and capable of) presenting exclusive training to broader audiences. 
&#183;       People who want to sharpen their speaking and technical presentation skills.

I do not propose to take part in the training myself but will take an organizational role. I wish to emphasize that if you are chosen to take part you must fully commit to the program and see the whole project through unless there are clear extenuating circumstances. So only respond if you are very serious about this. Those who are interested please respond to me by Dec 17.
CheersGraham JonesPresident, VANTUG
