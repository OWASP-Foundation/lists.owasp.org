<PRE> Hey everyone,

The next OWASP meetup is *next month (March 28th) at 6pm* the team from
Security Innovation will present a lab on *&quot;Exploit your way through
vulnerabilities, and learn application security concepts&quot;*.

Please register because it will be fully booked soon!

*Meetup details*
Who - Security Innovation
What - Exploit your way through vulnerabilities, and learn application
security concepts
When - *Thursday March 28th at 6pm*
Where -  *Plenty of Fish, 25th floor, 555 W Hastings St, Vancouver, BC *
Why - Because Application Security is awesome!

*Meeting synopsis*

Want to test your skills in identifying web application vulnerabilities?
How about learning and applying real application security concepts? Here is
your chance to do so using the CMD+CTRL cyber range, a unique, immersive
environment where players exploit their way through hundreds of
vulnerabilities that lurk in business applications today. Success means
learning quickly that attack and defense is all about thinking on your
feet.

For each vulnerability you uncover, you are awarded points. Climb the
interactive leaderboard for a chance to win fantastic prizes! CMD+CTRL is
ideal for development teams to train and develop skills, but anyone
involved in keeping your organization&#8217;s data secure can play - from
developers and managers and even CISOs

*Requirements:* participants will need the following:

   - A laptop to connect to the CMD+CTRL website
   - Download and install Burp Suite (Community is okay) or OWASP ZAP

*Sponsor Recognition*
A big thank you to Plenty of Fish for hosting the event and providing food
and refreshments.  Without their help, we wouldn't have been able to
accommodate more folks for this talk and help our chapter grow.  Thank you!
