Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] OWASP Vancouver Meetup - This Thursday (Sept 27th)
Message-ID: <CA+B-BavUarum5d74biWZThr4=1VD-Haf5biS9_cnU9581DyW1g@mail.gmail.com>

 Hey everyone,

A quick reminder that *this Thursday (September 27th) at 6pm* Dana Epp will
present his topic *"Threat Modelling Gamification: How to get developers to
think differently at secure coding"*.

There are still some spots open, so please register
<https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/owasp-vancouver-threat-modelling-gamification-how-to-get-developers-to-think-differently-at-secure-tickets-49761724658>
before there is a waitlist!

*Meetup details*
Who - Dana Epp
What - Threat Modelling Gamification: How to get developers to think
differently at secure coding
When - *Thursday September 27th at 6pm*
Where *OpenDNS/CISCO* - * Suite 600 - 675 W Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC*
Why - Because Application Security is awesome!

*Meeting synopsis*
The concept of writing safer, more resilient software against the threat
landscape of today is a daunting task. Especially when tight budgets and
deadlines are constantly under pressure and the rapid adoption of faster
release cycles makes it far too easy to 'skip' thinking about the security
of the systems and data we rely on to deliver our software. In this
session, Dana will introduce threat modeling in a way to help you educate
your developers and DevOps on how to look for threats and how to think like
an attacker, all while having a bit of fun. From learning how to draw
developers in with gamification using a simple card game called 'Elevation
of Privilege' that focuses on identifying threats in your software to
leveraging free tools published by Microsoft to aid you in documenting and
responding to such threats, you will walk away with a better understanding
of how to look at your software more defensively. Practical exercises and
real world discussions will strengthen the presentation and re-enforce the
learning objective... to write safer, more secure software in every sprint.

*Speaker bio*
Dana Epp has spent decades as an architect that focuses on helping secure
software, data and infrastructure. When he's not helping to build and grow
software companies he's advising others on adapting and embracing the ever
changing landscape of IT. As both a Microsoft Regional Director and Azure
Security MVP, he spends a great deal of time on security engineering in the
cloud, focused on building safe, decoupled systems. His latest project is a
cloud threat protection platform for Azure, which you can check out at
www.auditwolf.com. You can also follow him at www.danaepp.com.

*Call for Presenters*
As mentioned in the last email, we are actively looking for individuals to
present at future OWASP sessions (January, March, May).  OWASP Vancouver is
a great way to share your knowledge and experience in a friendly
atmosphere.  As you already know, the community is very supportive and is a
great environment for first time presenters and veteran presenters alike.

If you are interested in presenting, please feel free to respond back to
this email or reach out to Farshad (farshad.abasi at miraisecurirty.com).

*Sponsor Recognition*
A big thank you to Open DNS/CISCO for hosting the event.  Without their
help, we wouldn't have been able to accommodate more individuals for this
talk and help our chapter grow.  Thank you!
