work with you to *"Hunting for vulnerabilities in OWASP Juice Shop"*.

It is fully sold out, so we are looking forward to a packed house tonight!
*If you have booked a spot and cannot make it, please cancel your booking.
There are many folks on the waitlist that would love to make it out.  *

If you are interested in the workshop, please sign up for the waitlist, we
do expect some spots to be open.  We will also have a good idea if a future
workshop is required.

*Meetup details*

*Meeting synopsis*
Have you ever wanted a hack a website? Did you want to see the types of
vulnerabilities which bad guys exploit? This limited availability workshop
will go through a purposefully vulnerable website and show you the

After a brief demo, you will have time to hack the website yourself to see
if you can find holes yourself.
