Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] October & November Meetings
Message-ID: <CAD_ZbKzmPuHbDVBCzOag=wvByRwMq9nvTqAfr6H-vLVxKc7e1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

We tentatively have a speaker for October 22nd, and I am planning to
host an OWASP ZAP Tutorial on November 19th (a hands on walkthrough
with OWASP ZAP, an intercepting proxy tool).  I will send out the
meeting announcements shortly, (waiting to confirm the speaker on
both).

Cheers,
Yvan
