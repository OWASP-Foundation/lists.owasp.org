*OWASP Chapter Meeting Announcement*

The next OWASP Vancouver meeting will be held on January 23rd, and Ping
Identity be our host.

*Outsourcing Identity: Understanding Privacy and Security in Identity
Services*

*Speaker:* Yvan Boily, Web Security Engineer, Mozilla Corporation

*Date & Time:* Monday, January 23rd, 2012 @ 5:30pm

Social Media has taken over the online world; what Microsoft attempted with
Passport has been made reality by Facebook, Twitter, Google, and other
service providers. In addition to the proprietary identity services these
platforms offer, several support protocols such as OpenID, This will be a
one hour presentation that will contrast the security and privacy features
available in major online identity protocols, and contrast these with
Mozilla's BrowserID protocol.

be extended to other groups to try to improve participation in OWASP. If
space runs out, preference will be given to those who have registered!

*About Ping Identity* Ping Identity has generously offered their downtown
