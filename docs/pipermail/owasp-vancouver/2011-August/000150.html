<PRE>Unfortunately I have had a medical issue come up with my family that will
prevent me from doing the recording today; can we do this on Thursday, same
time and place?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is awesome. So here is an email I would love for you to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> send on my behalf.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About 10 years ago I seeded an idea in a few peoples minds which has grown
</I>&gt;<i> into the OWASP you all know today.  I am lucky enough to be doing the
</I>&gt;<i> keynote celebrating the 10th anniversary of OWASP at AppSecUSA (and btw
</I>&gt;<i> happy to deliver the same talk to others around the world, schedules
</I>&gt;<i> permitting) and I am asking for your help. The theme of my talk will be
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Community the Killer App&quot; in which I will reflect on how the OWASP
</I>&gt;<i> community has organized and mobilized online and in person. In my talk I
</I>&gt;<i> plan to use a series of videos from both well known technology people and a
</I>&gt;<i> set of videos from the OWASP community itself. I need your help in pulling
</I>&gt;<i> together videos from the OWASP community from the Chapters you run.
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically I am looking for two things:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Personal stories - I know that over the years OWASP has affected many
</I>&gt;<i> people personally. I have heard stories about people who found the project
</I>&gt;<i> and went back to higher education as a result of it, I have heard stories
</I>&gt;<i> about people that have started companies in software security after getting
</I>&gt;<i> inspired by OWASP, heard about people that learned appsec in India and gone
</I>&gt;<i> on to get very well paid jobs in the US based on their skills and I have
</I>&gt;<i> heard about people earning a living based on OWASP material. I have heard
</I>&gt;<i> about OWASP teams working to help charities get secure and so on. I would
</I>&gt;<i> love to be able to share a few of these stories. The more interesting the
</I>&gt;<i> story the better and the more global or humble in nature the better. Its
</I>&gt;<i> amazing set of people and I want to hear from the amazing. I am asking you
</I>&gt;<i> as chapter leaders to help me find those stories by contacting your chapters
</I>&gt;<i> or talking to your members and working with me to record a short video
</I>&gt;<i> message from them that I can use in my talk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Chapters Around the World - I want to put together a quick collage of
</I>&gt;<i> video messages from chapters around the world. The idea will be to do a
</I>&gt;<i> short visit to all the countries where OWASP has a presence and get a quick
</I>&gt;<i> hello message from each chapter. I am asking for each chapter leader to work
</I>&gt;<i> with me on a short video message of your chapter saying &quot;hello from the XXX
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP chapter&quot; in your native language. We have chapters in amazing
</I>&gt;<i> locations around the world so if anyone will get creative and record your
</I>&gt;<i> message in-front of global landmarks (Athens and the Acropolis as an
</I>&gt;<i> example, Dubai by the Jumeriah, Sydney by the Opera house of Harbor bridge
</I>&gt;<i> etc) all the better but you can't organize a landmark video then simply a
</I>&gt;<i> message from your local chapter meeting will be great as well.  Line them
</I>&gt;<i> all up, have them all shout &quot;hello from the XXX OWASP chapter&quot; in their
</I>&gt;<i> native language and I will then edit these videos together to get a montage
</I>&gt;<i> that will show the sheer global diversity and reach of the OWASP Project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am also interested in any video material people have of chapter activity
</I>&gt;<i> that I can edit into the film clip. Maybe people have done socials, beers
</I>&gt;<i> nights, go-kart events etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will accept any video formats (I will be editing with Final Cut on OSX)
</I>&gt;<i> but the better quality the video and the more creative the better. If you
</I>&gt;<i> can help me (and I really hope ALL chapters will come through on this) you
</I>&gt;<i> can send me an email directly and I will invite you to a drop box to upload
</I>&gt;<i> your video and we can discuss dates. I will need all videos by the first
</I>&gt;<i> week in September at the very latest!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please, please help me create what I think can be some compelling videos
</I>&gt;<i> messages from the people that really make OWASP what it is. The community,
</I>&gt;<i> thats you!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you and cheers!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mark
