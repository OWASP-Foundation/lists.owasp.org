With their confirmed presence, the OWASP Summit will provide a relaxed but professional environment to meet, discuss, influence and contribute to OWASP projects.
There are still funds available!

Hello,

Pardon me fellow OWASP'ers, but this should be of interest 
to you, so...just letting you know that my company has
scheduled a 4-day "Secure Web Application Development and 
Testing" course for November 18 through 21 (Tuesday to 
Friday). More information is available online at
http://www.wavefrontcg.com/IntroWebAppSec_2008a.pdf. The 
course is being held in Vancouver BC. 

If someone you know - inside or outside your organization -
may benefit from such training, we would very much 
appreciate it if you could pass this communication on to
them. 

A brief summary follows...

"This 4-day course aims to provide web application 
developers with an understanding of application security 
issues and attack vectors, and the skills necessary to 
code defensively against web attacks. We will show how 
hackers can abuse a web application, and what developers 
can do to prevent this. In addition, we show how developers 
and testers can test their own applications in order to 
determine if they are susceptible to web application 
attacks. The material would also be of interest for 
software testers (QA); system, network and database 
administrators; software, network and system architects; 
Information Security personnel; and Compliance Officers 
(Privacy, SOX, PCI, etc.)"

Thank You
