*Meeting synopsis*

Want to test your skills in identifying web application vulnerabilities?
How about learning and applying real application security concepts? Here is
your chance to do so using the CMD+CTRL cyber range, a unique, immersive
environment where players exploit their way through hundreds of
vulnerabilities that lurk in business applications today. Success means
learning quickly that attack and defense is all about thinking on your
feet.

For each vulnerability you uncover, you are awarded points. Climb the
interactive leaderboard for a chance to win fantastic prizes! CMD+CTRL is
ideal for development teams to train and develop skills, but anyone
involved in keeping your organization?s data secure can play - from
developers and managers and even CISOs

*Requirements:* participants will need the following:

   - A laptop to connect to the CMD+CTRL website
   - Download and install Burp Suite (Community is okay) or OWASP ZAP
