Hi Everyone,

We are on track for planning the meeting for July 22nd, although we are
still trying to secure a location.  We will have presentation on risk
assessment methodologies, and are probably going to have a presentation on
threat modeling.

If anyone can provide a location either downtown or near a skytrain station,
it would be greatly appreciated; feel free to contact me on or off list.

Here are the posts:
