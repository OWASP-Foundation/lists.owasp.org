<PRE>Hi Everyone:

 

I ping the list to see if anyone has suggestions for training courses.

 

My explicit interest is in designing secure web services within
enterprise and federated SOA environments. My implicit interest is in
evaluating the security of web services in those environments.

 

Knowledge is my number one priority, a certification is a bonus. 

 

I have thought about pursuing something around pen testing to help
design away from vulnerabilities. Am I fooling myself with that notion
or are there better course offerings out there for my explicit interest?

 

Thanks,

 

Martin
