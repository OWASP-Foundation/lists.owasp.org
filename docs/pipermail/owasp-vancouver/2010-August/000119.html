<PRE>Thanks to everyone who came out for the August 19th meeting!

Don and Santosh delivered a great presentation on PCI requirements, and have
agreed to answer any further questions.  The sessions was recorded, however
some technical work still needs to be done before the videos will be shared,
thanks in advance for your patience!

Our next meeting is scheduled for September 23rd, where Dana Epp will lead
an interactive session on using the Microsoft SDL tools to threat model a
real world application, using input from the attendees!

One of the big challenges for the OWASP Vancouver chapter is that in order
to bring you interesting content, we need to know what is interesting to
you!

As security practicioners, what content are you interested in?  What do you
want to see speakers discuss?

As a developer, what questions do you have?  What areas do you need help
with?

How can we help the OWASP Vancouver chapter to grow?

I look forward to hearing your feedback, either on or off list!

Regards,

Yvan Boily
</PRE>
