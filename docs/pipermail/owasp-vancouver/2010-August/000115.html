<PRE>Hi Everyone,

Due to an itchy trigger finder and the need to get the meeting announcement,
unfortunately there were some updated details that didn't make it into the
meeting announcement.  The topic and content remains the same, but the
speakers have changed, and I have corrected the name from IPS Networks to
IPS.  My apologies for the re-posting!

Regards,
Yvan Boily

Date &amp; Time: *Thursday, August 19th, 2010 @ 5:30pm

The meeting will feature two presentations on PCI compliance and
certification from IPS.  Following the second presentation, we can open the
meeting up for question and answer.

*Speakers*:* Santosh Nair (Chief Technology Officer) and Don Bowen (Senior
Account Manager), IPS

**Organizations today are faced with a host of regulatory compliance
requirements, such as PCI, SOX and NERC. It has become increasingly
important for organizations to ensure payment account data security through
compliance with the PCI DSS. Don and Santosh will attempt to demystify some
of the myths and questions that commonly trouble PCI level 3 and 4
merchants. They will also discuss why the PCI DSS is necessary and provide
an auditor&#8217;s perspective on what is required to achieve compliance through
completing a &#8220;Self Assessment Questionnaire&#8221;.

*
I am also working to engage speakers on the following topics:

   - OWASP Top Ten
   - Digital Forensics
   - Web Application Firewalls
   - Fuzzers
   - Exploitation Techniques

If you know anyone who is talented in these areas, or have an interest in
participating as a presenter, please let me know, I am happy to work with
anyone in the chapter to help fulfill these requests!
</PRE>
