Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] Call for Volunteers!
Message-ID: <CAD_ZbKx20m3o-rJqr8U73=YG3XEDRrMC2z7anmFzCnucbJaFRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

We need volunteers to:

- Host an OWASP meeting (I can physically host it at the Mozilla office, or
another location if suggested / preferred, but I would prefer someone else
to be MC for the event!)
- Recruit speakers!

If you are interested, please send me an email about which meeting you
would like to volunteer to coordinate!
