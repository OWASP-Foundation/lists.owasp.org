Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] Secure Web Application Development and Testing -
	Hands-On Training Course (Vancouver, May 3-6)
Message-ID: <00cb01cbc962$87419030$95c4b090$@ca>

Hello

 

We have scheduled the next offering of this 4-day course for May 3-6 

(Tue-Fri) in Vancouver BC.

 

This course aims to provide Web application developers and testers 

(QA) with an understanding of application security issues and attack 

vectors, and the skills, tools and techniques to code defensively 

against web attacks. It also covers techniques and tools for testing 

web application security. Given the nature of the threats from 

hackers and cyber-criminals, having web applications that can take 

the punishment is critical. And if your web applications collect 

personal, private, sensitive, medical, or financial information, you 

have legal and contractual reasons (such as privacy legislation, PCI 

DSS, etc.), to ensure that such information is collected and managed 

securely.

 

This course is aimed at developers; testers/QA staff; system, network,

database and application architects; analysts; system, network and

database administrators; auditors; and security and compliance staff.  

 

This is the sixth year we have run this course and it has been well

attended each time.

Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] February Meeting
Message-ID: <AANLkTikyvRONhtkfrtpjku0B6mKV_qL8SVxOUXbU0yDq@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All,

My apologies for dropping the ball for the OWASP Vancouver meeting in
January; unfortunately with the change of jobs and other things that came
up, I failed to arrange things properly for a meeting.

We will have our next meeting on Thursday, February 24th at 5:30, and Sierra
will continue to host our meetings.  I will do a short presentation based on
discussions of the OWASP Summit, and will follow that up with a presentation
on F/OSS source code analysis tools, discussing their strengths and
weaknesses, and demonstrating how they can be used.

We don't currently have any other presentations or topics lined up for the
next few meetings, and as always, I am looking for feedback from the
community about what topics we would like to see covered.  I will send out
the actual meeting announcement later today or tomorrow, and would
appreciate any feedback or suggestions for future topics.

Regards,
Yvan Boily
