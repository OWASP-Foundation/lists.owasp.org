Hi Group,

I have been totally bogged down this month and completely failed to actually
organize anything.  During some discussion after last months meeting I
raised the idea of having a less formal meeting at a pub or coffee shop, but
unfortunately I am already double booked for Thursday of this week.  I am
proposing an informal meeting at Cactus Club (Pender & Burrard) at 6:00 on
Wednesday, November to have a few drinks, and decide what kind of content
and meetings we want to have next year.

If you plan to attend, please respond to this email so that I can make a
reservation.  Also, if you want to suggest an alternate venue, feel free :)

Regards,
Yvan Boily

Thanks to Alan for pointing out that I excluded a date.  I am proposing next

Unfortunately I have had something come up and I am unable to attend tonight.  Given the limited response, do we want to consider another date or time (or the 2 people who responded can still meet up)

Regards,
Yvan Boily
