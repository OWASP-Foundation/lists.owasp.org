Hello

 

We have scheduled the next offering of this 4-day course for November 

2-5 (Tue-Fri) in Vancouver BC.

 

This course aims to provide Web application developers and testers (QA)

with an understanding of application security issues and attack vectors,

and the skills, tools and techniques to code defensively against web 

attacks. It also covers techniques and tools for testing web application

security. Given the nature of the threats from hackers and cyber-

criminals, having web application that can take the punishment is 

critical. And if your web applications collect personal, private,

sensitive, medical, or financial information, you have legal and 

contractual reasons (such as PCI DSS), to ensure that such information

is collected and managed as securely as possible.

 

The course is aimed at developers; testers/QA staff; system, network,

database and application architects; analysts; system, network and

database administrators; auditors; and security and compliance staff.  

 

This is the fifth year we have run this course and it has been well

attended each time. A course registration form is attached.

 

A course outline is available at

Other training offerings are listed at

Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] October 21st Meeting: Microsoft SDL and OpenID
	Security Analysis
Message-ID: <AANLkTinRjpzqF4=NM+e_UuCRy6jaLojvXdV3DjnRBj9Z@mail.gmail.com>

*OWASP Chapter Meeting Announcement*

I am pleased to announce the next OWASP Vancouver meeting!  We will have the
meeting on October 21st, and Sierra Systems is once again hosting our
meeting.

This month we have two speakers, Vishal Khandve, and San-Tsai Sun

*Speaker:* Vishal Khandve
*Topic :* An Overview of the Microsoft SDL.

*Presentation Abstract:*
A presentation on individual Microsoft security development practices, which
includes:
Roles and responsibilities for individuals involved in the application
development process.
Mandatory security activities.
Optional security activities.
Application security verification process.

*Speaker Bio: *
Currently working for a multinational bank, Vishal is responsible for
metrics and reporting on security development.
Vishal has over 6 years of experience in the IT industry, with domains
ranging from ERP, CRM, and Human Resourcing, and holds a  Masters in
Computer Science from the University of Pune.

*Speaker:* San-Tsai Sun
*Title :* OpenID Security Analysis and Evaluation

*
Presentation Abstract:*
OpenID is a promising user-centric Web single sign-on protocol. According to
the OpenID Foundation, there are currently more than one billion
OpenID-enabled user accounts provided by major service providers such as
Google, Yahoo and AOL. In this presentation, I will present OpenID security
analysis and the evaluation results on 200 OpenID-enabled websites.  Our
preliminary result shows that more than 50% of OpenID-enabled websites are
vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attack (CSRF) that allow an
attacker to modify the victim's account profile information directly; and
 75% of evaluated websites allow an attacker to force the victim to login
their websites as the attacker stealthily. With additional practical
adversary capabilities (e.g., trick users to use a malicious wireless access
point or install a malicious browser extension) that enable an attacker to
intercept the authentication response from the identity provider, the
attacker can impersonate the victim on 65% of OpenID-enabled websites and
re-masquerade the victim on 6% of the websites by simply applying the
intercepted authentication responses. To the end, I will demonstrate the
attack vectors employed in the evaluation process and discuss our proposed
countermeasure for the current OpenID-enabled websites and future OpenID
specification.

*Speaker Bio:*
San-Tsai Sun is a PhD candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering
department (ECE) at the University of British Columbia (UBC). He works in
the the Laboratory for Education and Research in Secure Systems Engineering
(LERSSE) under the supervision of Professor
Konstantin Beznosov. His research interests include Web application
security, Web 2.0 security and privacy, and distributed access control
architecture. His PhD dissertation focuses on improving the security and
usability of access control mechanism in Web related systems. Before joining
UBC, he was an Information Technology Director at the UCOM Training Center
in the Systex Corporation, Taiwan.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=9xF-3xJqb2TY=3f7j_J0Ox8q-RpX--8XoB_62@mail.gmail.com>

Hi OWASP Members,

I am working to bring together a group of volunteers to participate in
developing and presenting material related to online safety for children and
parents.  This effort is going to be coordinated with various organizations
in Canada, and will be focused initially on the Greater Vancouver Regional
District and Victoria, with an expanding focus based on success.

If you are interested in participating, or would like to be kept updated as
we move forward, please send me an email.  Note that there will not be an
official mailing list for this until the project moves forward, and anyone
interacting with the organization may be expected to go through some degree
of background checks to ensure compliance with specific legal requirements.

If you are interested in participating in this effort, or you would like
additional information, please reply to me with your name, the city you live
in, and a number you can be reached at.

Regards,
Yvan Boily

Message-ID: <AANLkTikce9E-dGgK_cXMy1q2P5VLP08Qy8SXhqPSL3eN@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

As discussed at tonights meeting, here are a few things:

San-Tsai Sun's email address for those with questions, etc:
santsais at ece.ubc.ca

Next meeting is supposed to be November 18th, but unfortunately Sierra's
space isn't available that day.  We can push it off to Friday, or change the
week, or we could have another meeting at a Pub or other suitable location.

We also lack a speaker, but Thomas asked about a comparison of some web
scanning products.  I suggested that if we had 4 volunteers to coordinate to
perform a test of some scanners it might be an interesting project, but I
don't know if it is feasible to complete before the next meeting.  Are there
any members interested in presenting?

So far here are the topics we have for the new year:
- Fuzzing - I will do a 2 hour technical presentation on fuzzing, including
a demonstration of fuzzing to find file format bugs, protocol bugs, and web
application bugs
- Cryptography - we have at least one speaker interested to talk about this.

What are other topics people want to hear about?

Regards,
Yvan Boily

I know that I am really pushing this, but I am doing it because I think it
is very important to the security community!

If you haven't already, and you have an interest in Application Security,
please go to
http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/8431/application-security and
commit to the Stack Exchange proposal.  When the site reaches 300 users an
interactive Q/A forum will be created dedicated to Application Security.
This will provide a centralized place to ask and receive high quality
responses to tough questions.

Thank you for your participation, and this will be my last appeal for people
to sign up!

Message-ID: <AANLkTinjJJj7ZWgwBevJxJpwnikMWWPuu-tAvE_vH4QF@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

First email out to the group.

I had the opportunity to attend last weeks OWASP group meeting and I've
really got to say that this is a great group of highly skilled and
passionate individuals. Thanks to all involved for putting it on! I look
forward to attending more in the future. My name is Thomas, although I am
currently unemployed (looking) my previous employment includes working for a
big 4 accounting firm specializing in vulnerability management and PCI
DSS/SAQ/ASV services. You can read more about me on my LinkedIn found
here.<http://www.linkedin.com/in/tjsiry>Feel free to add me as a
friend, I really enjoy meeting other professionals
in the security industry.

Due to my past experiences performing as a QSA Yvan has suggested the idea
of holding a presentation with a large Q&A segment on PCI. I'd be happy to
do this but only if there is interest out there. I could cover topics such
as...

- What is PCI and why you should or should not care.
- Introduction into the realm of PCI DSS structure.
- My pro-tips for preparing for a formal PCI audit (both SAQ and DSS).
- Little known PCI methods that may assist in becoming complaint.
- The recent changes to both the DSS and ASV requirements.
- Large Q&A session on whatever you'd like to talk about.
- *Your idea here*

I don't mind delving deep into whatever the group may wish to discuss. I am
truly an independent view on this matter.

Thanks much for reading.

Thomas
