<PRE>
Hello

We have scheduled the next offering of this 4-day course for October 23-26
(Tuesday-Friday) in Vancouver BC.
 
This course aims to provide Web application developers and testers (QA/QC)
with an understanding of application security issues and attack vectors, and
the skills, tools and techniques needed to code defensively against web
attacks. The course also covers tools and techniques for testing web
application security. Given the nature of the threats from hackers,
cyber-criminals, industrial spies and nation-state agents, having web
applications that can take the punishment without barfing up sensitive
information is critical. If your web applications collect personal, private,
sensitive, medical or financial information, you have legal and contractual
obligations (such as privacy legislation, PCI DSS, CSOX,  etc.), to ensure
that such information is collected and managed securely.
 
The course is aimed at developers; testers/QA staff; system, network,
database and application architects; analysts; system, network and database
administrators; auditors; and security and compliance staff.   
 
This is the seventh year we have run this course, and it has been well
attended each time. The course is updated each year to being it up-to-date
with new technologies and attack vectors.
