------------------------------

Hello,
 
We have scheduled a presentation of our 4-day "Secure Web 
Application Development and Testing" course in VANCOUVER BC 
for April 28 through May 1 2009 (Tuesday to Friday). More 
information is available online at 
http://www.wavefrontcg.com/IntroWebAppSec_2009a.pdf 

Course: Secure Web Application Development and Testing
Dates: April 28 - May 1 2009 (4 days)
Location: Vancouver (downtown)
Instructor: Rui Pereira,CISSP,CISA,CPTS/CPTE

A brief summary follows...

"This 4-day course aims to provide web application 
developers with an understanding of application security 
issues and attack vectors (XSS, SQL Injection, Broken Access 
Control, Forced Browsing, etc.), and the skills necessary to 
code defensively against web attacks. We will show how 
hackers can abuse a web application, and what developers 
can do to prevent this. In addition, we show how developers 
and testers can test their own applications in order to 
determine if they are susceptible to web application 
attacks. The material would also be of interest for 
software testers (QA); system, network and database 
administrators; software, network and system architects; 
Information Security personnel; and Compliance Officers 
(Privacy, SOX, PCI, etc.)"

If you know of anyone else who may benefit from this training, 
please pass this information on to them. The more the merrier 
we always say (although the course is capped at 14 students).

Thank You

Leaders,

The Global Projects Committee is in the process of improving the OWASP
Project structure by determining orphaned projects, updating and
augmenting the existing project criteria, and reclassifying projects
to help users find OWASP Projects that are relevant and important to
them. To that end, we have sent out a Project Update survey to all
OWASP Project Owners to fill out before April 1st, 2009.

In addition, we would like to give the OWASP Community the opportunity
to provide feedback for any particular OWASP Project.

If there's a particular project that you enjoy using or have some
suggestions for, please fill out the feedback form here:
https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=cEp6TlUxeU5KZDdXaTdlNk5PRUgxWVE6MA
..

Please keep feedback constructive and note that all feedback will be
made public.

Feel free to share this feedback form with other OWASP Community
members, OWASP Project users, etc.

You can read more about the Global Project Committee's efforts here:

Hey Everyone.

I've mentioned it before, but today I'm proud to announce that the
Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) version 1.0 has been released
and is freely available for download from http://www.opensamm.org

SAMM is an open framework to help organizations formulate and
implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the
specific risks facing the organization. The resources provided by SAMM
will aid in:

* Evaluating an organization?s existing software security practices
* Building a balanced software security program in well-defined iterations
* Demonstrating concrete improvements to a security assurance program
* Defining and measuring security-related activities within an organization

SAMM was defined with flexibility in mind such that it can be utilized
by small, medium, and large organizations using any style of
development. Additionally, this model can be applied
organization-wide, for a single line-of-business, or even for an
individual project.

As an open project, SAMM content shall always remain vendor-neutral
and freely available for all to use. The project has received a huge
amount of attention and is keeping me busy, but I'm always open to
more feedback and supporters.

Thanks!

p.

 Folks,

The Colorado OWASP Conference (SnowFROC) was a bit hit in Denver, CO on 5
Mar.  We had about 300 folks show up and some high quality presentations.

The videos<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Front_Range_OWASP_Conference_2009#Agenda_and_Presentations:_5_March_2009>were
produced by volunteers, but look pretty good.

Enjoy!

To: OWASP-Leaders at lists.owasp.org


The Greek Chapter of OWASP co-organizes a track in the 4th
Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems
(http://www.mcis2009.org) on the topic of Web Application Security.
Below you can find the corresponding call for papers.

Please forward this CFP to your local chapters' mailing lists or to
whoever you think might be interested.

We would also like to place this event under the auspices of OWASP and
also discuss the possiblity of having someone from the global
committee as a guest keynote speaker.

For any additional information reply to this message or contact me directly.

Thanks,
Kostas Papapanagiotou
OWASP Greek Chapter


Description
????
The emergence of Web 2.0 technologies brought about the extensive
deployment and use of web-based applications and web services. Such
applications are easy to develop and deploy and demonstrate impressive
features for users, resulting in their current wide use. Nonetheless,
the level of security in web applications doesn?t seem to go along
with their popularity: important security issues have been found and
privacy concerns have also been raised recently. In addition, the
Cloud Computing paradigm promises even greater flexibility; however
corresponding security and privacy issues still need to be examined.
This track aims to bring together application security experts,
researchers, educators and practitioners from the industry, academia
and international communities such as OWASP, in order to discuss open
problems and new solutions in application security. In the context of
this track academic researchers will be able to combine interesting
results with the experience of practitioners and software engineers.

Suggested topics include (but are not limited to):
?       Secure application development
?       Security of service oriented architectures
?       Threat modeling of web applications
?       Cloud computing security
?       Web applications vulnerabilities and analysis
?       Countermeasures for web application vulnerabilities
?       Secure coding techniques
?       Platform or language security features that help secure web
applications
?       Secure database usage in web applications
?       Access control in web applications
?       Web services security
?       Browser security
?       Privacy in web applications
?       Standards, certifications and security evaluation criteria for
web applications

 *OWASP Releases World?s First Security Code Review Guide for Fre**e*

*The OWASP Foundation, March 30, 2009 *? The Open Web Application Security
Project (OWASP) today announced the official release of the free OWASP Security
Code Review Guide<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Code_Review_Project>v1.1.
The Code Review Guide provides details on how to review code for all
sorts of application vulnerabilities. Together with the OWASP Security
Developer Guide <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Developer%20Guide> and OWASP
Security Testing Guide <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing%20Guide>,
OWASP has created a powerful suite of books that covers most of what people
need to know about application security. The 216 page book can be downloaded
from the OWASP website or a bound copy can be ordered for the cost of
printing.

The Code Review Project is led by long time OWASP participant Eoin Keary
from Dublin, Ireland. Like all OWASP projects, the work is performed by
Eoin?s team in a free and open manner, and coordinated via the OWASP wiki
and project mailing list. Everyone is welcome to download the guide and
benefit from OWASP?s research. You can also join the project and contribute
to making the guide even better.

?Despite the many claims that code review is too expensive or time
consuming, there is no question that it is the fastest and most accurate way
to find and diagnose many security problems. There are also dozens of
serious security problems that simply can't be found any other way.? said
OWASP Chair Jeff Williams. ?Still, code review is no panacea. Static tools,
dynamic tools, and manual testing all have an important role to play in
verifying the security of an application.?

There is overwhelming evidence that the vast majority of web applications
contain security holes that are increasingly putting people and
organizations at serious risk. Our Code Review Guide is one part of OWASP?s
strategy to make application security visible and enable the market to
support the development of secure application software.

OWASP is a free and open community that focuses on improving application
security. Join the thousands of organizations that are using OWASP guidance
to run a responsible application security program. Anyone can join our
community and use our free tools and documents, attend our free conferences
and local chapter meetings, and join projects to make the world?s software
safe for the Internet.

*About OWASP* -The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open
community dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and
maintain applications that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools,
documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in
improving application security. We advocate approaching application security
as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective
approaches to application security include improvements in all of these
areas. We can be found at http://www.owasp.org.
