Thank you to everyone who came out to our last chapter meeting in March!

On *Thursday May 31st at 6pm* Roger Trevisan will present his topic
*"Application
Security Testing in the modern world: understanding various methodologies
and where they fit in your development life-cycle"*.

There is a slight change in venue for this meetup, we will be meeting at
Microsoft offices and a huge thanks to Microsoft for hosting!  Please note
that it will be at *Microsoft's 1111 West Georgia offices (FortisBC Centre)*
.

Meetup details
If you are somewhat involved with the application security world, you
probably have heard about some of the following acronyms when talking about
security testing: MPT, SCA, SSA, RASP, IAST, DAST and SAST. With all the
new developments and technologies related to cybersecurity it may be
challenging to understand what solutions are available and the advantages
each of the alternative offers and how do they fit your software
development lifecycle. This session will give you an overview on the most
prevalent security testing technologies and highlight where they fit in the
SDLC.
