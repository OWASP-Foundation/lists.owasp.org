Greetings,

My name is Cambria Moore, I am a consultant with Scope Services. I am currently working with an internet compliance company in the Seattle/Bellevue area. We are looking for an experienced web developer that is willing to work in house as part of a team. 


I came across this list through the OWAP website and am hoping to draw upon your expertise regarding this search.  Do you know of a collaborative web developer who could be a fit or if it's possible to post the position on any web site?

This company provides a web security application for very large financial institutions and presently has enough job orders to keep them busy through 2012. We really need someone that enough experience to hit the ground running.  We are very flexible regarding compensation (base salary + excellent benefits) and have a strong commitment to recruiting the &quot;best of the best&quot;.

I have added a copy of the position profile to the bottom of this email, for your review and would really appreciate any insights or ideas you might have.  Also, please feel free to circulate this information among your peers, networking groups, and associations.  Again, I appreciate your help and please give me a call if I can provide you with additional information.

Thank you and best regards,
