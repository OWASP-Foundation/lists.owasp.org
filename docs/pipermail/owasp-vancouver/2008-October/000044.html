Hello OWASP ! ! ! 
It is with great pleasure and pride that I'm officially launching today the OWASP European Summit 2008
This is an event 100% focused on OWASP and will have the highest concentration of OWASPers per square meter (OWASP is flying 80+ of its Leaders and key contributors to Portugal). If you ever wanted to be more involved with OWASP or wanted to know more about certain OWASP projects, this Summit is for you. Please join us in Portugal and help to 'Set the AppSec Agenda for 2009'.
I would like to personally acknowledge the work done by an amazing team of OWASP collaborators that have been working non stop for the past 3 months on everything related to the Summit's organization: Thank You!  (and if you want to be involved, please join asap this great OWASP virtual team)
Below is the official Press Release containing detailed information about the Summit's organization and objectives. 
Obtaining media visibility for our events is an historical challenge for OWASP. It would be great if you could help us by personally distributing this Press Release to your media contacts and influential bloggers.
Looking forward to seeing you all in Portugal :)

PRESS RELEASE: OWASP European Summit - PortugalPortugal/Algarve - 4th - 7th November 2008
Setting the Web Application Security Agenda for 2009: OWASP Invites You to Join Our Summit in Portugal
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008</A>
With the theme 'Setting the AppSec agenda for 2009', the OWASP Summit will be a worldwide gathering of OWASP leaders and key industry players to present and discuss the latest OWASP tools, documentation projects, and web application security trends. Join us in Portugal in just a few short weeks! This venue hosts a diverse selection of training courses along with technical and business tracks, making it THE place to learn about web application security and the resources OWASP has available for use today.
OWASP is a not-for-profit organization with the purpose of supporting the Web Application Security community around the world, and has granted $250,000 USD for web application security research. In addition to over 40 presentations from the OWASP Leaders and grant recipients, the OWASP Summit will host multiple Working Sessions designed to improve collaboration, achieve specific objectives and identify roadmaps for OWASP projects, chapters, and the OWASP community itself.
To facilitate this event, OWASP is investing $150,000 USD which will be used to cover air travel and accommodation expenses for OWASP leaders, active contributors, and select key industry leaders. With their confirmed presence, the OWASP Summit will provide a relaxed but professional environment to meet, discuss, influence and contribute to OWASP projects.
There are still funds available! If you are interested in attending and you meet the profile of the current OWASP supported attendees (see list here: <A HREF="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pAX6n7m2zaTVLrPtR07riBA">http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pAX6n7m2zaTVLrPtR07riBA</A>) contact Paulo Coimbra (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-vancouver">paulo.coimbra at owasp.org</A>).

The OWASP Summit will also host a large and diverse selection of training courses, covering multiple OWASP specific and Web Application Security Topics.
The remarkable impact of OWASP is made possible only by the collaboration of many dedicated people and organizations worldwide.
