Hi All,

I am happy to announce the first OWASP Canada call, which will hopefully
become the first in a series of events designed to connect the OWASP
community across the country!

In addition to the Vancouver location, we will be streaming it online (info
TBA).

On Wednesday, August 7th, various chapters across Canada will join a
virtual call with a speaker from one location delivering a streaming talk,
and engaging the entire community.  There will be multiple avenues for
engagement.

*OWASP Canada
*

*Bug Bounty Program for the Web*

*Speaker:* Raymond Forbes, Web Security Engineer, Mozilla Corporation

*Date & Time:* Wednesday August 7th, 3:00 PDT
This talk will look at the Mozilla bug bounty program and how it has helped
with web security.  We will be looking at the history of the program, how
it is set up, some successes and common concerns.

Raymond has been a web security engineer with Mozilla since 2011, and is
visiting from Seattle, WA.

*Registration:* Registration is strongly recommended; we will attempt to
accommodate people who have not registered, but those with tickets will be
given preference.  Register here
