<PRE>Hi Group,

Yet more job spam.  I have been asked if I can recommend any people in
the application security space for a position in the interior.  It
would require relocating to Kelowna, and the role has significant
opportunity for advancement in a large organization.

The role will include both security architecture requirements and
security testing work.  The position is not publicly listed currently,
and I was asked by a former colleague to recommend people, so if you
are strong in this place and interested in a move, please let me know.

If you express interest in the position, please send me an email
off-list with a brief background and your contact information.  You
will need to authorize me to share your contact information with my
colleague and they will contact you, but nothing you share with me
other than your contact information will be shared with the hiring
manager.

Disclaimer: there is no financial motivator for me on this, I am
trying to help a former colleague to fill a gap in their team.

Regards,
Yvan Boily
</PRE>
