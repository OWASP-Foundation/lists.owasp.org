Message-ID: <CAD_ZbKzHR0XFC3OxOomzzXTY0YrqJKLEpe8pw0j-4uKQcLtyVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have posted the schedule for the remainder of the year (March through
November).  After the success of BSidesVancouver, I hope to resume having
monthly meetings.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Vancouver#2013_Meetings

If you are interested in presenting, have a topic to learn about, or just
want to chat about a specific topic, let me know, and we can use that as
the basis for the meeting.

I am happy to continue hosting the meetings at Mozilla for the time being,
but I am also open to hosting meetings at another location.

Regards,
Yvan Boily

Just a reminder that the venue for the VanSec meetup[1] was changed to The
Railway Club.

For those of you who are new to the community, you can look for me, I will
be wearing my usual black hoodie that says Firefox across the front of it!

Looking forward to seeing people this evening!

Cheers,
Yvan Boily

Hi All,

No meeting this evening as I was unable to line up a speaker.

We have speakers for April and May, and I will announce the dates once it
is sorted out.

Please remember that you can propose a speaker or request a speaker on a
topic by emailing me, or submitting a proposal at

	about Security
Message-ID: <CAD_ZbKz_5zCmdWcOqziyKmct9W413TtiqzeTQWwocG3dH=UrTw@mail.gmail.com>

For those who don't know what reddit is, it is basically a message board.

The Mozilla security team is happy to answer any questions about how we
handle security!
