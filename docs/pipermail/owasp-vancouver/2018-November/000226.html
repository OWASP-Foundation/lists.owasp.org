<PRE>Hey everyone,

A quick reminder that *tomorrow (November 29th) at 6pm* Jeevan Singh will
work with you to *&quot;Hunting for vulnerabilities in OWASP Juice Shop&quot;*.

It is fully sold out, so we are looking forward to a packed house tonight!
*If you have booked a spot and cannot make it, please cancel your booking.
There are many folks on the waitlist that would love to make it out.  *

If you are interested in the workshop, please sign up for the waitlist, we
do expect some spots to be open.  We will also have a good idea if a future
workshop is required.

*Meetup details*
Who - Jeevan Singh
What - Hunting for vulnerabilities in OWASP Juice Shop
When - *Thursday November 29th at 6pm*
Where *OpenDNS/CISCO* - * Suite 600 - 675 W Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC*
Why - Because Application Security is awesome!

*Meeting synopsis*
Have you ever wanted a hack a website? Did you want to see the types of
vulnerabilities which bad guys exploit? This limited availability workshop
will go through a purposefully vulnerable website and show you the
different ways that individuals with malicious intent will look to do harm.
After a brief demo, you will have time to hack the website yourself to see
if you can find holes yourself.

*Speaker bio*
Jeevan Singh is a Senior Security Engineer for an HR software company,
where he is embedding security into all aspects of the software development
process. Jeevan enjoys building security culture within organizations and
educating staff on security best practices. Jeevan is responsible for a
wide variety of tasks including: architecting security solutions, working
with development teams to resolve security vulnerabilities and building out
security features. Before life in the security space, Jeevan had a wide
variety of development and leadership roles over the past 15 years.


*Call for Presenters for 2019*
As mentioned in the last email, we are actively looking for individuals to
present at future OWASP sessions.  OWASP Vancouver is a great way to share
your knowledge and experience in a friendly atmosphere.  As you already
know, the community is very supportive and is a great environment for first
time presenters and veteran presenters alike.  *Deadline is December 15th,
2018 if you are interested in giving a talk.*  If you are interested in
speaking at the OWASP Seattle chapter, please let us know and we will put
you in touch with the organizers.

If you are interested in presenting, please feel free to respond back to
this email or reach out to Farshad (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-vancouver">farshad.abasi at miraisecurirty.com</A>).

*Sponsor Recognition*
A big thank you to Open DNS/CISCO for hosting the event and providing food
and refreshments.  Without their help, we wouldn't have been able to
accommodate more individuals for this talk and help our chapter grow.
Thank you!
