Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] ISC^2 Board Member Petition
Message-ID: <CAD_ZbKwJRKygHYPjfOwqHcJmh6hmtUZciv2NChbYZsde-ez1fg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Just a quick update to the list; we will be resuming meetings in October,
not September as I had originally hoped.

For those on the list who hold a CISSP certification I suggest checking out
the following petition by Wim Remes to be nominated for the ISC^2 Board of
Directors.
