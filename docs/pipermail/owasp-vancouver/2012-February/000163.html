&gt;<i> Thanks so much for the detailed response Yvan. Some questions and answers
</I>&gt;<i> below
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm implementing some fairly detailed logging for a client, for security
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and for legal coverage ( non-repudiation of reading disclaimers, etc).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> records are being logged to a database, with the goal to convince the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> client that this db should be moved to a separate server so that logs go
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a a remote machine for which the app has only insert privileges.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Logging to a remote server is always a good start, but I am curious about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the decision to store logs in a database rather than a using a conventional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> logging service (syslog or one of its variants, a flat file that gets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pushed or pulled periodically, etc).  Using a custom format or storing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> records within a database may make it more difficult to get the data into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an event processing engine that allows admins of your application to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correlate application logs against system and network events.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In our case, we're using Pyramid and SQLAlchemy, so the decision to use
</I>&gt;<i> the DB was because it make adding our our own event processing logic almost
</I>&gt;<i> trivial. It also allows us to have a relational schema for logging that
</I>&gt;<i> corresponds somewhat to the logic of the application, and we're logging
</I>&gt;<i> application specific details. We may push this layer into WSGI middleware,
</I>&gt;<i> not sure about that. Pyramid has some really nice facilities for hooking
</I>&gt;<i> into the life cycle of the request, if you make a custom request factory,
</I>&gt;<i> you can connect beginning and end of life cycle callbacks. Another design
</I>&gt;<i> pattern of Pyramid that is useful for this is the Zope 3 style
</I>&gt;<i> views-as-classes, which are multi-adapters of request and context and are
</I>&gt;<i> always instantiated, called, and destroyed once per request ( no shared
</I>&gt;<i> state between threads at all). A happy side effect of this is that it's
</I>&gt;<i> safe to store your intermediate results of what the view is doing as
</I>&gt;<i> attributes on the view. We do this, and we store the a ref to the view on
</I>&gt;<i> the request object itself. This means that the end of life callback can
</I>&gt;<i> introspect the view to figure out exactly what went on during this request.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main driver for the logging is the non-repudiation, so by logging the
</I>&gt;<i> http request, we collect user id, time, ip, url, etc, but this gets
</I>&gt;<i> connected to entries that log file downloads, file uploads, reading the
</I>&gt;<i> disclaimers, editing the user accounts, and activating the user accounts.
</I>&gt;<i> Those all have their own schemas, but that is quite easy to implement on
</I>&gt;<i> the framework we're using. So by putting it the db, it's very easy for us
</I>&gt;<i> to provide the client ( and their legal counsel ) a record that shows they
</I>&gt;<i> did their due diligence in making sure that users read the terms and
</I>&gt;<i> conditions before uploading, etc. Hopefully that clarifies that design
</I>&gt;<i> decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That makes sense; you may also want to consider having the application
servers generate an HMAC or signature for log messages if non-repudiation
is a goal; without that there is no evidence that a DBA didn't modify the
log entry (this is also a consideration for any logging format).  From an
ops perspective, you may want to have some scripts handy for conversion
into a more traditional logging format.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of the logs is of each request for a pyramid view ( essentially any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> complete page, does not include requests for css/javascript/images ). I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> had
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> read that it's a good idea to just log the whole http request, but of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> course that has the session token in it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In general, logging the entire HTTP request outside of a debug
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> environment is unsafe since you invariably end up storing user credentials,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> session state data, and other sensitive data outside of the application and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its database.  Best case scenario, this is a violation of best practice,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worst case scenario it is a regulatory or compliance issue.  If you go that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> route, make sure you are properly sanitizing the fields that contain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sensitive data before writing them to the database.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is wiping out the cookies header and any password fields sufficient for
</I>&gt;<i> this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The cookie header, secret user credential components (passwords, auth
tokens, etc), but also consider CSRF or session tokens that may be embedded
in a request body as well.


&gt;<i> I was thinking about attack awareness, and thought that monitoring POST
</I>&gt;<i> vars would be good, because then one can detect repeated attempts to fudge
</I>&gt;<i> them. But then we must be careful never to log any of the password
</I>&gt;<i> submission variables.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm just wondering whether I should be concerned about the fact that if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a compromise allowed someone to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> read the db, could they hijack an admin users session?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In general, yes.  Note that in this case, you should be extending beyond
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the consideration of an external attacker and consider what a malicious
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user might be able to accomplish.  If your authentication scheme is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designed properly, and you have proper separation of duties within your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> environment, a system administrator or DBA should not be able to violate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the non-repudiation aspect of the design without resorting to collusion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great, thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Which has me trying to figure out if that matters, given that if they can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> read the db, they're pretty far in. I could redact the session token (
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> all cookies ) before logging, but would this have potential negatives for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> forensics?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Generating a proper audit trail extends beyond capturing the content of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an HTTP request; it would be more effective to generate an audit record of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every privileged action a user performs (or, if necessary, of every action
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> performed).  Generating this type of an audit capability serves two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> purposes:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First, it lets you meet any requirements you might have around executing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application level forensics of what happened.  Having discrete, clearly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documented, and granular audit capabilities make it clear which subject
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> performed with operation on which object, and the context in which that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> operation performed, without having to sift through HTTP request blobs in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> log files.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, that's what we're accomplishing through the related schema of http
</I>&gt;<i> requests to user actions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Second, it provides data that can be used to make an application attack
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aware, which increases the likelihood of detecting and stopping an attack
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or compromise.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You can read more about attack aware applications here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project</A> (especially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the detection points)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.mozilla.com/webappsec/2011/02/02/attack-aware-applications/">http://blog.mozilla.com/webappsec/2011/02/02/attack-aware-applications/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - Mozilla's AMO uses CEF logging to implement attack awareness if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want some examples of how to do this in python (although that is specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to our use of Arcsight)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am planning on looking further into that, Python's WSGI system is ideal
</I>&gt;<i> for this as the middleware layer before the application can access the same
</I>&gt;<i> db, look at the log events, and make decisions on allowing/disallowing
</I>&gt;<i> incoming requests before any of the main application logic is even
</I>&gt;<i> called.  I will definitely take a look at those!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I forgot the link to AMO:
<A HREF="https://github.com/mozilla/zamboni/">https://github.com/mozilla/zamboni/</A>

You can take a look at how CEF logging is implemented by looking at the
logging components there.
