<PRE>*OWASP Chapter Meeting Announcement*

The next OWASP Vancouver meeting will be held on February 20th, and Ping
Identity be our host.

*How to own a BILLION identities in less time than it takes to boil an egg
*
*Speaker:* Rui Pereira, WaveFront Consulting Group

*Date &amp; Time:* Monday, February 20th, 2012 @ 5:30pm
*
Abstract*
Unless you've been living under a rock over the last few years, you can't
help but notice that a lot of hacking seems to be going on - and personal
information like e-mail addresses, passwords and credit card numbers are
going out the door at several large organizations (Sony anyone?). This
presentation deals with a web application hacking technique called SQL
Injection (SQLi), and how it was used in various recent hacks such as
Epsilon, Heartland Payment Systems, Pirate Bay, eHarmony, Sony and HBGary.

We cover the how's of it: How it is done and how you can protect your
organization from being the next big (or little) name on an ever-growing
list. This presentation was also given at the IT4BC conference earlier this
year.

About Ping Identity*
Ping Identity has generously offered their downtown office space, located
on the corner of Beatty and Robson, to host our chapters meetings moving
forward. The office is 6000sq/ft of a mostly open floor plan, so we should
be able to accommodate a large group.
