Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] Secure Web Application Development and Testing -
	Hands-On Training (Vancouver, 24-27 September)
Message-ID: <006701ce9156$84cceac0$8e66c040$@com>


Hello

We have scheduled the next offering of this 4-day course for September 24-27
(Tuesday-Friday) in downtown Vancouver BC.
 
This course aims to provide Web application developers and testers (QA/QC)
with an understanding of application security issues and attack vectors, and
the skills, tools and techniques needed to code defensively against web
attacks. The course also covers tools and techniques for testing web
application security. Given the nature of the threats from hackers, script
kiddies, cyber-criminals, industrial spies and nation-state agents, having
web applications that can take the punishment without barfing up sensitive
information is critical. If your web applications collect personal, private,
sensitive, medical or financial information, you have legal and contractual
obligations (such as privacy legislation, PCI DSS, CSOX,  etc.), to ensure
that such information is collected and managed securely.
 
The course is aimed at developers; testers/QA staff; system, network,
database and application architects; analysts; system, network and database
administrators; auditors; and security and compliance staff.   
 
This is the 8th year we have run this course, and it has been well attended
each time. The course is updated each year to being it up-to-date with new
technologies and attack vectors.
 
A course outline is available at

Subject: [Owasp-vancouver] SANS Mentor for SEC 542: Web App Penetration
 Testing and Ethical Hacking (Taking it Slow)

Hi,


I've been given the opportunity to participate in mentoring this local Burnaby/Vancouver class in Web App Penetration Testing for SANS:

   http://www.sans.org/mentor/class/sec542-burnaby-11sep2013-david-klassen

I have just learned that I can offer a discount, that I didn't know about, which is why I am sharing this with you. I have my own discrepancies about the high prices for education and training, so to be honest I probably would not be sharing this with you personally unless there was a discount that you can benefit from.

In SEC 542 you can learn great information about the pen-test profession as it relates to assessing Web Applications for security concerns, and achieve industry recognized certification. I took this course and learned about quite a few new tools that I hadn't been tracking before, and also more about the history of security and vulnerability research in this space.

I had a fairly large appetite for coming to grips with the real security risks associated with online applications, which is also why I have agreed to help mentor this course. What is nice about SANS Mentor styled courses, is that you can slowly learn the material over a period of 10 weeks(as opposed to 5-6 days), like any normal course offered at a local training educational program.

If you, or someone you know is interested in the content of this course and want to register, feel free to forward this e-mail and Flyer:

When looking to register, talk to me first. Apparently I can offer a discount, that I didn't know about till this week.


Cheers!
