Hi everyone,
it's some time ago since the last OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter
Meeting (26. April 2007) and because of that, I'd like to inform you
what's about the next meeting.

As you might know, I was attending the OWASP AppSec Conference in Milan
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/6th_OWASP_AppSec_Conference_-_Italy_2007)
and there I met some other local chapter leads. We've talked about many
different stuff and also about the meeting cycle. Until now, we had a
meeting every second month but I'd like to change that to every three
months like other chapters which had success with this. So, we'll have a
meeting four times a year and it's really something special. I'd also
like to have at least two talks for any meeting, so that it's worth to
come even if you have about 2h to travel to come to Zurich :)

So, the next meeting will take place at the end of July.

I already have some people who offered to give a talk, so we'll not
running into the problem of not have interesting content for the next
meetings :)
The offered talks are very different to each other so I think there will
be something for everyone and if you also like to give a talk or know
someone who can offer something interesting (also for example
workshops), please contact me directly.

It would also be great if we can again offer a dinner after the meeting
and because of this I'm looking for a company or two who would like to
sponsor that (for about 20 people I think). Once more, if you can offer
something, just contact me.

I'll inform you again, as soon as I've got more information.

Regards,
Sven
