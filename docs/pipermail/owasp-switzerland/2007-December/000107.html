Hi everyone,
yesterday I received a mail over the OWASP Leaders mailinglist by Tom
Brennan who's one of the board members of the OWASP Foundation. It was
about how to coordinate the year 2008 and what we should do in our local
chapters. One of the points was the following:
... and 2+ additional board members ...

This means that the board of the OWASP Foundation would like to have a
local board for every Chapter around the world which I think would be a
really good idea.

So here's my request for one or two additional board members for the
OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter.

I'm looking for people who would like to ...
- - support me in organizing the OWASP meetings in Switzerland
- - help promoting the OWASP

What you should have:
- - Time (some hours per month)
- - Engagement

What you will get:
- - Involvement in the decisions in the board of the OWASP Foundation
- - Of course fame and glory ;)

It would also be good if you're a full member of the OWASP but this is
not needed.

If you're interested, please let me know.


Regards,
Sven
