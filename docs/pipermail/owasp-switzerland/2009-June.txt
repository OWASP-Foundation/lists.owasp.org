Hi everyone,
I know it's quiet a bit late for the following invitation but we should
really try to make it happen.

On the 25th of June (yes, thats already in about one week), there will
be an OWASP Meeting in Zurich with special guests.

Jerry Hoff and Jason Li from Aspect Security [1] will come to
Switzerland and give a talk about the benefits of a security API such as
ESAPI on this meeting. They will also give a class during the weekend at
the Jazoon conference.

Bruno Blumenthal from In&Out [3] will give a talk which was also given
at the AppSec Conference in Krakow about "Advanced SQL injection
exploitation to operating system full control".

So even if we're late, it's really worth to attend this meeting.

When:
25th of June from about 17:00 to 18:30.

Where:
Badenerstr. 281 in Zurich -> AVANTEC
http://map.search.ch/zuerich/badenerstr.281?x=146m&y=-53m&z=1024

Who:
As at all of our meetings, everyone is welcome, so if you know someone
who could also be interested in participate, ask him/her to come too  :)

As usual, please add yourself to the doodle poll, that we know how many
people we can expect:

If there are any further questions, don't hesitate to ask me directly.

Best regards,
Sven

Hi all,

my train arrives 16:58 at Zurich HB, so I will be late.
Are there others in the same situation as I am?

If yes, I wanted to know if it's possible to start the
meeting a little bit later, say 17:15 ?

Regards,
Rudolf.
