Good morning everyone,
as you might know Sandro's set up a voting pool [1] at doodle.ch for a
meeting for people which are interested in discussing about the OWASP
Switzerland Local Chapter.

Now, I have two questions:

1.) When would the date be finally fixed?

At the moment it looks like Saturday the 11th of November at 10:00 AM
would be the date when most people which have voted can participate (5/6).

2.) What do we have to discuss at this meeting?

I think at least the following topics should be part of the meeting:

- - Who is who?
- - What is the OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter at the moment?
- - What should the OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter be?
- - Future meetings

Feel free to customize this list :)

 Hello,
  
 I am a french PhD student working about security in java-based middleware
platforms. I am interested in the activities of the owasp, and, since no
chapter exists in France, I am turning to the nearest one ;-)

 I have seen that a kick-off meeting have been scheduled. Is there some
particular condition to participate in an Owasp chapter ? Are they already some
specific foreseen activities, or will the november meeting answer this question
?

 best regards,

Pierre Parrend

What a pity there is no chapter in France! But our gain then :)

There are no required conditions to participate in an OWASP chapter. The
next (first) chapter meeting is planned to be some inaugural meeting to
learn to know the others and to plan on what to do how in this chapter. So
as you said, the november meeting could answer most of these questions.
Depending on the number of attendees, of course.

Cheers,
Adrian

 Hi Adrian,

 I hope (as you) that a sufficient number of people will be able to attend the
next owasp chapter meeting(s). I unfortunately will not be able to be in
Z?rich, because I am in the USA during the all week (4 to the 11 :-( ).

 I do not know if I can take an active part to the chapter without being
present, but do not hesitate to forward me the infos, I really hope to be there
for the following meeting/activities. I do not know if you need any info on what
I am working on ?

cheers,

Pierre
