Hi everyone,
as you know it's planned to transfer the OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter
into an association so we can handle finances, contracts etc. more easily.

Attached you'll find a first draft of the bylaws (in German). If there's
any feedback or question, please let me know :)

If you want to become a founding member, you should make sure to have a
valid OWASP Membership as that's the requirement to become a member of
OWASP Switzerland. (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership)

A concrete date for the founding will be announced as soon as possible.

Best regards and have a nice weekend,
Sven

Hi everyone,
as I did not get any complains on my draft of the bylaws for OWASP
Switzerland, I think we should fix a date for the founding.

As we already have a date which hopefully is blocked already in your
agenda aka our next local chapter meeting, I suggest to use it for the
founding.

Here you'll find a poll so we can decide if we want to spend the next
meeting on this: http://doodle.com/i5erww7g42vxa87t

Poll will be closed Sunday 24. August 2011.

Best regards,
Sven

Hi everyone,
we will found the association OWASP Switzerland on the 9. August 2011. I
really hope it will not take too long, so starting at 17:00 should be no
problem.

Can anyone sponsor a meeting room near Zurich Mainstation for this? If
not I'll reserve the room we had for the last two meetings.

If you want to join the founding you should bring your valid OWASP
Membership number with you.

Best regards,
Sven
