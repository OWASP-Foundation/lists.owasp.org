<PRE>Hi Everyone,
next Tuesday it's again time for an OWASP Switzerland Meeting.

* When:
June 12th 2012 (Next Tuesday!!!)
Starting at 17:30

* What:
Reversing Android Apps

Depending on the interests of the attendees, Tobias will talk more or
less about the topics described in the following abstract:

This talk shows the possibilities of reversing Android applications.
After an introduction about Android issues in the past, Tobias Ospelt
explains how he managed to download several thousand Android
applications from the Google Market, and which security issues are
present in various apps. Developers tend to use cryptography in the
wrong way, and extracting sensitive information from the mobile
application often is really easy. Apps can be decompiled, altered and
recompiled, which means that for most apps it is very easy to steal code
or to include malware. Some of the apps use obfuscation to disguise the
code, but for example encryption keys (e.g. used to send encrypted data
to a server) can easily be extracted. Small game developers, as well as
big companies and other Android developers are not aware of the risk or
do not care about the fact that their code can be decompiled to java and
disassembled to smali code. This is how a lot of protection mechanisms
can be circumvented, such as licensing (cracking a Game) or corporate
solutions (enforcing policies on the mobile). The talk shows how easy
everybody can reverse android apps and how encryption keys can be
extracted, even when the code is obfuscated.

* Where:
Rheinfelder Bierhalle
Niederdorfstrasse 76
8001 Z&#252;rich
