<PRE>Hi everyone,
I'd like to invite you to our next OWASP Switzerland meeting on November 12th 2014. If you want to attend, please make sure to register for the event (<A HREF="http://doodle.com/qvmqh8txgcapewf7">http://doodle.com/qvmqh8txgcapewf7</A>) as the space is *limited* to 30 attendees.

* When:
Wednesday, November 12th 2014
Starting at 18:00
Doors at 17:30

* What (presentation):
&quot;Living on the Edge. Advanced ModSecurity to Save Your Ass&quot; by Christian Folini
Abstract: In an ideal world, applications would be secure and developers would know what a secure flag on a cookie means. But in an ideal world, there would not be any attackers. In the real world, applications are obscure, developers do not know what a cookie is and they are generally unaware their application uses http at all. More often, there is no documentation and no surviving developer who knows an application, nobody fixes bugs, nobody has a working support contract and nobody has any interest to solve problems throughly. So ModSecurity comes in as the tool of choice to enhance, patch and secure your online application. I'll show you how. And I promise I will not bore you with SQLInjection defense.

In addition, we'll get a short tour of Open Systems Mission Control Operations by their CEO Martin Bosshardt.

* Where:
Open Systems AG
R&#228;ffelstrasse 29
8045 Zurich

Sven
