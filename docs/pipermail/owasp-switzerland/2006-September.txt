Hi Members,
I have two questions to you:

- - Is there still an active OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter because there
isn't much traffic on the ML? :(

- - If the answer for the question above is yes; When and where would the
next meetings taking place?


sincerely,
Sven Vetsch aka. Disenchant

Ok, thanks for the information.

As I've seen many people on the list did a short introduction so please
let me introduce myself also.

My name is Sven Vetsch and I'm working as a Security Analyst, Security
Tester and Security Engineer in Berne.

My main topics are Webapplication Security and also Social Engineering.

I did already talks on various events depending to WebappSec for example
XSS-Worms, WebappSec Attack Classes and in a few weeks there will be one
about the future of Cross-Site Scripting.

At the moment I'm focused on doing research on XSS, for example webbased
malware.

At this time, there are 26 Members on the OWASP Switzerland Local
Chapter ML and if at least half of them are still receiving and of
course reading their mails I can't see any problem why this people
shouldn't meet each other. If there are enough interested people, I'm
looking forward to join the chapter and meet interesting people.

Who else is interested in a meeting?

Even if Adrian is looking for a new chapter leader it shouldn't be a
problem to organize something.


regards,
Sven

Hi Sandro,
sounds nice thanks :)

Zurich should be ok for most of the people because it's no Problem to
get there from everywhere in Switzerland. I first thought about Berne
because the people which already introduced themselves on the list
mostly said that they're working in Berne or somewhere in or near this
part of Switzerland. But as I wrote above Zurich should be ok.

For me middle of November would be ok, my schedule isn't full yet ;)

But before someone definitely set up something I think it would be very
important to get some facts like; How many  people will participate?
What would we do there? etc.

For example when there's a room (it looks like there's one -> Sandro)
then I think it would be very nice to do some talks or workshops there.
After that it would also be nice to eat something together for some
smaltalk and of course there should also be time for discussions.

If we do some talks I'm looking forward to prepare one.

What's the opinion of the rest of the list members?

Regards,
Sven

Hi Patrick,
I'm not an OWASP member too. But this shouldn't be a problem when you
have a look at the official OWASP website

[quote]
Also, anyone can participate in or contribute to an OWASP project
without becoming a member.

Regards.
Sven

Since it is allowed to join without being a member, you  input is
welcome to me and i agree with you.
If it is not possible to book a room in the IBM building, i can look for
one in the TechnoPark (Zurich "Hardbr?cke"). I'll also need information
like how many people and such.

From awiesmann at somap.org  Mon Sep 18 16:43:35 2006
From: awiesmann at somap.org (Adrian Wiesmann)
Date: Mon, 18 Sep 2006 22:43:35 +0200
Subject: [Owasp-switzerland] Meeting / Membership / Administrivia
Message-ID: <20060918224335.473001b7@localhost.localdomain>

Hello all

Good to see that this mailing list gets some attention lately. Please let
me add a few thoughts and some administrative notes to the general
discussion:

I suggest to get things started on an easy pace. A chapter needs much
work. Not only to get it started but also to keep the momentum once things
begin to roll. So start slowly and keep your energy (and enthusiasm) and
don't loose your breath right at the beginning. Which in other words means
that I propose to start with a meeting where everybody learns to know the
others, where we can drink a beer (or two) and have a chat. Element of
such a meeting could be to formulate ideas and plans on how to proceed
afterwards: how often to meet (2-5 times / year, probably during IEX and
other expos), where to meet (changing cities), who will organise the next
meeting and what to do during the next meetings (workshops, talks,
drinkies, etc).

About the topic "member or not member of OWASP": Don't overrate the thing
called "membership". When I started with OWASP it was more important to
contribute than to pay a fee (actually there was none :) ). Things changed
since I stopped my work as editor for the Guide. But I guess it is still
valid to say that an Open Source project like OWASP needs every fine
contributor it can get. So no stress concerning the membership. (It's an
other story when talking about companies leeching all the stuff created by
the project without giving anything back, of course.)

And then some administrative concern: Please don't start the habit of
replying to everybody and to the list as well. If you answer a mail to the
mailinglist, everybody on the list will get a copy. There is no need to
send an additional copy to some of the list members. Such an additional
recepient will get two copies which is annoying for the recepient and
completely silly.

Regards,
Adrian

Hello guys!

I work in geneva as a web application pentester / auditor and I'd really 
enjoy participating in this event. About the place, I really need to refresh 
my german a little bit so a trip to Zurich, or wherever there's a train station,
sounds good to me.

looking forward to meeting you, 
antonio

Yes, sounds also nice and it maybe better to focus on the future of the
chapter and do some discussions than to start with talks and things like
that (of course it would be fine to do such next time).

So I think it would be fine if you Sandro could give some concrete dates
out when it would be possible to get the room you wrote. After this the
list members which are interested in a meeting can say which date would
be ok for them. From my point of view a saturday is predestinated for
that because most people don't work then an should have time especially
when the date is definite early enough.


Regards,
Sven

Just to clarify ... I believe that Sandro intended to offer the 11th *and* 
4th November as possible dates.

doodle.ch is being used as a way to let everyone vote for the date(s) when 
they are available. You'll see what I mean when you click on the link 
(trust me, I'm a security professional :-) ...

Hi Members,
I have two questions to you:

- - Is there still an active OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter because there
isn't much traffic on the ML? :(

- - If the answer for the question above is yes; When and where would the
next meetings taking place?


sincerely,
Sven Vetsch aka. Disenchant

Ok, thanks for the information.

As I've seen many people on the list did a short introduction so please
let me introduce myself also.

My name is Sven Vetsch and I'm working as a Security Analyst, Security
Tester and Security Engineer in Berne.

My main topics are Webapplication Security and also Social Engineering.

I did already talks on various events depending to WebappSec for example
XSS-Worms, WebappSec Attack Classes and in a few weeks there will be one
about the future of Cross-Site Scripting.

At the moment I'm focused on doing research on XSS, for example webbased
malware.

At this time, there are 26 Members on the OWASP Switzerland Local
Chapter ML and if at least half of them are still receiving and of
course reading their mails I can't see any problem why this people
shouldn't meet each other. If there are enough interested people, I'm
looking forward to join the chapter and meet interesting people.

Who else is interested in a meeting?

Even if Adrian is looking for a new chapter leader it shouldn't be a
problem to organize something.


regards,
Sven

Hi Sandro,
sounds nice thanks :)

Zurich should be ok for most of the people because it's no Problem to
get there from everywhere in Switzerland. I first thought about Berne
because the people which already introduced themselves on the list
mostly said that they're working in Berne or somewhere in or near this
part of Switzerland. But as I wrote above Zurich should be ok.

For me middle of November would be ok, my schedule isn't full yet ;)

But before someone definitely set up something I think it would be very
important to get some facts like; How many  people will participate?
What would we do there? etc.

For example when there's a room (it looks like there's one -> Sandro)
then I think it would be very nice to do some talks or workshops there.
After that it would also be nice to eat something together for some
smaltalk and of course there should also be time for discussions.

If we do some talks I'm looking forward to prepare one.

What's the opinion of the rest of the list members?

Regards,
Sven

Hi Patrick,
I'm not an OWASP member too. But this shouldn't be a problem when you
have a look at the official OWASP website

[quote]
Also, anyone can participate in or contribute to an OWASP project
without becoming a member.
[/quote]

Regards.
Sven

Since it is allowed to join without being a member, you  input is
welcome to me and i agree with you.
If it is not possible to book a room in the IBM building, i can look for
one in the TechnoPark (Zurich "Hardbr?cke"). I'll also need information
like how many people and such.

From awiesmann at somap.org  Mon Sep 18 16:43:35 2006
From: awiesmann at somap.org (Adrian Wiesmann)
Date: Mon, 18 Sep 2006 22:43:35 +0200
Subject: [Owasp-switzerland] Meeting / Membership / Administrivia
Message-ID: <20060918224335.473001b7@localhost.localdomain>

Hello all

Good to see that this mailing list gets some attention lately. Please let
me add a few thoughts and some administrative notes to the general
discussion:

I suggest to get things started on an easy pace. A chapter needs much
work. Not only to get it started but also to keep the momentum once things
begin to roll. So start slowly and keep your energy (and enthusiasm) and
don't loose your breath right at the beginning. Which in other words means
that I propose to start with a meeting where everybody learns to know the
others, where we can drink a beer (or two) and have a chat. Element of
such a meeting could be to formulate ideas and plans on how to proceed
afterwards: how often to meet (2-5 times / year, probably during IEX and
other expos), where to meet (changing cities), who will organise the next
meeting and what to do during the next meetings (workshops, talks,
drinkies, etc).

About the topic "member or not member of OWASP": Don't overrate the thing
called "membership". When I started with OWASP it was more important to
contribute than to pay a fee (actually there was none :) ). Things changed
since I stopped my work as editor for the Guide. But I guess it is still
valid to say that an Open Source project like OWASP needs every fine
contributor it can get. So no stress concerning the membership. (It's an
other story when talking about companies leeching all the stuff created by
the project without giving anything back, of course.)

And then some administrative concern: Please don't start the habit of
replying to everybody and to the list as well. If you answer a mail to the
mailinglist, everybody on the list will get a copy. There is no need to
send an additional copy to some of the list members. Such an additional
recepient will get two copies which is annoying for the recepient and
completely silly.

Regards,
Adrian

Hello guys!

I work in geneva as a web application pentester / auditor and I'd really 
enjoy participating in this event. About the place, I really need to refresh 
my german a little bit so a trip to Zurich, or wherever there's a train station,
sounds good to me.

looking forward to meeting you, 
antonio

Yes, sounds also nice and it maybe better to focus on the future of the
chapter and do some discussions than to start with talks and things like
that (of course it would be fine to do such next time).

So I think it would be fine if you Sandro could give some concrete dates
out when it would be possible to get the room you wrote. After this the
list members which are interested in a meeting can say which date would
be ok for them. From my point of view a saturday is predestinated for
that because most people don't work then an should have time especially
when the date is definite early enough.


Regards,
Sven

If we get a good "turn-out" I will book the room.

If you prefer an "evening" then don't vote, and I will set up an evening.

Just to clarify ... I believe that Sandro intended to offer the 11th *and* 
4th November as possible dates.

doodle.ch is being used as a way to let everyone vote for the date(s) when 
they are available. You'll see what I mean when you click on the link 
(trust me, I'm a security professional :-) ...
