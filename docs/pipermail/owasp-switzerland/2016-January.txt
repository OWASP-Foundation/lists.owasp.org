	to Switzerland

Hi All,

 

I'm currently working with an experienced Security professional who is
looking to relocate to Switzerland and was keen to find out if anyone is
actively looking to hire someone with his background/skills.

 

The individual has over a decade of experience within technical information
security where he started out as a consultant performing penetration tests,
vulnerability research, exploit development, reverse engineering, code
audits etc and since then he has progressed throughout his career through to
positions such as Head of Penetration Testing, Head of Consultancy to CTO
where the company has grown to circa 90 people, with him being one of the
five founding members.

 

If anyone is interested, please contact me at your earliest possible
convenience to arrange a time to discuss in more detail.

 

Regards,

Lee Anderson

Hi Lee

Please be aware, that headhunters aren?t allowed on OWASP mailing list as it?s promoting their own business. If the security professional you mentioned is looking for a job in Switzerland, he?s more than welcome to directly send an E-Mail to this mailing list.  

I?m assuming this was a honest mistake and you didn?t notice that your e-mail violates OWASP policies so I won?t take any further actions on this. Please make sure to not send similar messages to OWASP mailing lists again, thanks :)  

regards,  
Sven
