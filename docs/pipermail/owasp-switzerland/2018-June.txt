Hi everyone,

I just wanted to let you know about BSidesZurich Call for Paper, which is
still open until 30th June
https://bsideszh.ch/call-for-papers/

I believe we got the ingredients in place for a nice event also this year
- we have a great keynote speaker, Vincenzo Iozzo (@_snagg)
- we have an amazing team of skilled reviewers, you may wanna challenge
them with your submissions
- we have a different and quite interesting format, with short talks (20m)
followed by lively discussions on the specific topic, check it out.

Hope to have see many submissions from you as well as have many of you
attending the event. Please let me know if you have any specific question,
happy to answer.

Have a great day
Cheers,
P.
