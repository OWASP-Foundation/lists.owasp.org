<PRE>Hi,

That's interesting. I as well don't think that these tools can be used by
less skilled operators. An operator of these tools has to make sure that the
tool is configured correctly. E.g. some sites require an authentication
cookie to access data. When this cookie is not embedded in the test requests
the scanner will not come beyond the authentication check and will therefore
not see the actual site. And oh wonder: No issues are found and the site is
considered secure. That's very dangerous. In the end it means that an
operator has to know quite a lot about how web applications work and how
they are deployed.

This year I was at Blackhat Training with Dinis Cruz. During the course he
talked about static analysis of the code with tools from Once Labs and
Fortify. (Just to keep the record strait Dinis consults Once Labs to improve
their tool). He says that these tools are helpful to find possible
vulnerabilities in large volumes of code which he then exploits manually
during testing. As far as I have seen he is also practicing the mixed
testing approach and uses the tools to automate the boring parts of testing.

Kind regards
Jan P. Monsch

Hi,

I recently had the chance to go to a Gartner Conference, where they
also talked about this subject.

They believe that AppSec Scanners are a strategic &quot;must do&quot; for
companies, as the bad guys will have the same tools and you don't want
to end wit a low hanging fruit not been found by yourself.
They believe that you can have less skilled persons using these tools,
I persoanlly am not convinced of that, when you consider reading the
reports also part of the game.
They difference between &quot;dynamic testing&quot; =&gt; scanning given
applications from outside (eg AppScan) and &quot;static testing&quot; =&gt;
scanning source code or even binaries (eg Fortify). Static testing
tools should be integrated in developer environments (eg Eclipse).

Regarding quality they claim that all tools are currently not mature,
so basically it does not matter which one you chose.

Last but not least they point out that Application Security should be
considered as responsibility of the developers, well aware that this
would be the ideal situation.
Therefore, also scanning for vulnerabilities should be done by the
developers, the security guys should only verify that the right tools
and experience is in place.

Interesting food for thought...

Regards,
Thomas
