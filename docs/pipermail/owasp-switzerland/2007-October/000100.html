<PRE>Hi Adrian

These tools are good for finding low hanging fruits, like known problematic
URLs and simple variants of XSS and SQL-Injection.

But they often fail on web applications with wizards or where correct data
has to be filled in to advance within the application. Also difficult to
detect is SQL injection in cases where there is no database SQL error
message displayed. Authorization issues and business logic flaws in
applications are also hard to detect, because they depend on data which must
semantically be correct. 

I have personally used Paros Proxy (Open Source) and N-Stealth (Commercial).
Although Paros is not very advanced it helps you not to forget test cases
and allows you to scan large sites for XSS bugs. If a bug is found you have
full access to the request which triggered the problem. So reproducing an
issue is simple.

I haven't seen the newest version of N-Stealth lately but when I was testing
with it I have rarely found a severe issue with it. It is a tool which
blindly tests known URLs of admin consoles and the like. Another issue is
that it won't show you the exact request which triggered the problem. So
reproducing an issue can be difficult. Based on my experience I would not
buy it anymore.

You should also keep in mind that depending on the web server configuration
it can happen that you get lots of false positives which you will have to
analyze manually.

With all that in mind I would not solely depend on the results of these
tools. I prefer a mixed approach: Manual hacking, source code and
configuration inspection, scanning and interview. Depending on the class of
problem I choose the most efficient approach. 

There are other things to write about these tools but I spare you the
details. If you have further questions feel free to ask.

Kind regards
Jan P. Monsch

Subject: [Owasp-switzerland] Question about WebApp Scanner

Hello Switzerland

I am interested to learn about web application scanners. Did you use one
of those? Are they worth the money (do they know AJAX etc)? Where could I
learn more about them (do you have any good links to reviews)?

Thanks for your help.

Regards,
Adrian
