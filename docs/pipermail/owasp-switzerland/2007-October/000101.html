Hi Adrian,
unfortunately I don't had the possibility to test the newest version of
any of the big commercial WebAppSec scanners out there yet so I can't
give my own feedback on them here but perhaps one of the following links
could help you:

Jordan Wiens did a quiet good job on reviewing the most popular
WebAppSec scanners out there. Perhaps you'll find something interesting
there:
<A HREF="http://www.networkcomputing.com/rollingreviews/Web-Applications-Scanners/">http://www.networkcomputing.com/rollingreviews/Web-Applications-Scanners/</A>

The &quot;Web Application Security Consortium&quot; (WASC) has recently started a
project called &quot;Web Application Security Scanner Evaluation Criteria&quot;
but nothing is released yet. I think this might become a very good
resource for information like you're looking for in the near future:
<A HREF="http://webappsec.org/projects/wassec/">http://webappsec.org/projects/wassec/</A>

Just as an additional hint, Acunetix has released a free XSS scanner
which you can use but AFAIK it has no JavaScript or as you asked for,
&quot;AJAX-Support&quot;:
<A HREF="http://www.acunetix.com/cross-site-scripting/scanner.htm">http://www.acunetix.com/cross-site-scripting/scanner.htm</A>

- From my point of view it really depends on your needs, which scanner is
the one you should use for your work but I also fully agree with Jan (&quot;I
prefer a mixed approach: Manual hacking, source code and configuration
inspection, scanning and interview.&quot;).

Btw. perhaps you should ask such a question also to the OWASP Testing ML
(<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing</A>) because there
are much more WebAppSec pentesters and also some scanner developers :)

Regards,
Sven
