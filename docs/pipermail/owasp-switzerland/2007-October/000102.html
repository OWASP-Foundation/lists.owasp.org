<PRE>Hi,

I recently had the chance to go to a Gartner Conference, where they
also talked about this subject.

They believe that AppSec Scanners are a strategic &quot;must do&quot; for
companies, as the bad guys will have the same tools and you don't want
to end wit a low hanging fruit not been found by yourself.
They believe that you can have less skilled persons using these tools,
I persoanlly am not convinced of that, when you consider reading the
reports also part of the game.
They difference between &quot;dynamic testing&quot; =&gt; scanning given
applications from outside (eg AppScan) and &quot;static testing&quot; =&gt;
scanning source code or even binaries (eg Fortify). Static testing
tools should be integrated in developer environments (eg Eclipse).

Regarding quality they claim that all tools are currently not mature,
so basically it does not matter which one you chose.

Last but not least they point out that Application Security should be
considered as responsibility of the developers, well aware that this
would be the ideal situation.
Therefore, also scanning for vulnerabilities should be done by the
developers, the security guys should only verify that the right tools
and experience is in place.

Interesting food for thought...

Regards,
Thomas
