Hi everyone,
it's extremely late to officially announce it but there will be an OWASP Switzerland Meeting this Tuesday (17.12.2013). I'm very happy, that Credit Suisse is offering a room in Oerlikon. We will meet at around 17:45 because the doors will close at 18:00. The address is Hagenholzstrasse 20/22 in 8050 Z?rich (CS Towers, a few minutes from the Oerlikon train station). If you already know, that you will join us but can't make it on time, please let me know in advance.

For the content - this year ends in just about two weeks so what would be better than to exchange our experience and stories on the current state of AppSec globally and also in Switzerland, especially about what happened during the year and what (if so) has changed. Last but not least we might even be able to look into the crystal ball and discuss some possible upcoming challenges we're going to face as individuals and a community in the AppSec year 2014.

As we only have a maximum of 16 seats available, it's *mandatory* to register by using the Doodle poll: http://doodle.com/eh8tacxguim93g65

... and as usual the meeting is open to everyone interested :)

Best regards and I hope to see many of you at the meeting,
Sven

Hi all

Just a quick reminder from my side: We will gather at 17:45 in front of the entrance. Don't be late. But... if you have to, give me a call: +41792795005 :-). Some seats are still available and rumours buzzing that there will be beer!

Cheers
Marco (helping to organize meetings)
