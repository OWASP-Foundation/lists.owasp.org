<PRE>Hi everyone
We&#8217;ve found a solution for the next OWASP Switzerland meeting, taking place on August 19th 2015. Thanks to Rob we will be hosted by Swisscom in the center of Zurich (Pfingstweidstrasse 51, 8005 Z&#252;rich / <A HREF="https://goo.gl/maps/dsZQc">https://goo.gl/maps/dsZQc</A>). Doors will be open at 17:30 and we will start at 18:00. If you&#8217;d like to join, please reserve your seat here: <A HREF="http://doodle.com/rmaifrfu4q3pqxav">http://doodle.com/rmaifrfu4q3pqxav</A>


Now for the content of the meeting:
We&#8217;ll try something new as nobody offered to give a full presentation. This OWASP Switzerland meeting will have to form of a small BarCamp (<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp</A>). That means everyone can bring a presentation which doesn&#8217;t have to be rocket science nor does it have to be even 10 minutes long or feature a fancy slide deck. If you ever wanted to share something AppSec related but can&#8217;t fill a full 45min presentation with it, now&#8217;s your chance. No registration for your talk/presentation/demo/&#8230; is necessary but if it takes more than 15min I would be interested in knowing about it before the meeting so I can make sure we&#8217;ll have enough time.


For the food aka. dinner we&#8217;ll be spontaneous as we don&#8217;t know at all how many presentations we&#8217;ll have and therefor when the meeting will come to an end :)


I hope to see all of you on August 19th and I&#8217;m looking forward to many different and interesting topics that will be presented.


PS: As usual the meeting is open to everyone and free of charge. So please don&#8217;t hesitate to share this invitation with anyone who might be interested in joining.


regards,
Sven
