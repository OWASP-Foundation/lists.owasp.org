Hi everyone,
as promised, this year we'd like to plan further ahead and so I'd like to announce the OWASP Switzerland meeting dates for 2013:

Tuesday, June 18th 2013
Tuesday, August 20th 2013
Tuesday, October 22th 2013
Tuesday, December 17th  2013

The meetings will start at 18:30 and take place in Zurich. The exact locations will be communicated as soon as we have them. I highly recommend you open your calendar right now and mark the dates :)

Lately a lot of people joined our Xing group. Please keep in mind, that this mailinglist is our main communication channel and last minute changes might not get announced through other channels like Xing, Facebook or Twitter.

Btw. don't forget to add the topics you'd like to talk or just hear more about at our local chapter meetings into the public list we've set up at http://bit.ly/ZpR0lZ

Best regards,
Sven

Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] Swiss Cyberstorm is looking for helping hands
	on June 13
Message-ID: <20130514153322.GB24926@elias>

Hi there,

The Swiss Cyberstorm conference 2013 will take place in Lucerne
on June 13.

https://www.swisscyberstorm.com

If you are interested to come, but you would prefer a free ticket,
we have a deal for you: We are looking for a couple of additional
helpers with the administration and logistics on site.
This will not keep you busy all the time and you will thus
have the opportunity to follow some of the talks - and to
get in touch with many participants and speakers. Add a
party in the evening on top of that.

If you are interested, then please get in touch with me.

Best,

Christian Folini
