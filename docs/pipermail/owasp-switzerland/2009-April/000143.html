<PRE>Hi all,

Swiss Cyber Storm II is coming soon! We have currently 200+ registered
participants. We are doing all we can for a educational and cool event.
Potentially we are running out of space. However, the overflow room (no
talks) will give wargame participants the chance to have a spot for
solving wargame puzzles without speeches and talks. All talks are held
in the auditorium of the University of Applied Science, Rapperswil. If
you are interested in the talks (easy &amp; advanced) or if you don't feel
disturbed by the talks, go to the auditorium. The talks are for the
public (easy level) and for the professionals (advanced = geek level).
There is interesting stuff for almost anyone.

And yes; we have our wargame concept in german/english version now.
Please read the wargame concept PDF under &quot;Wargames&quot; if you feel like
solving the puzzles. You need the information to be prepared!

Web Application related wargames:
- SSL Web Attack
- JavaScript Malware Analysis
- Surf Jacking
- SQL Injection
- Flash Hacking
- Applet Hacking
- ActiveX Hacking
- Cross-site Scripting
- Cross-site Request Forgery
- URL Redirection Attack

We are looking forward to seeing you!
