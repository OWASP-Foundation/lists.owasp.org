Space is limited.





* When:

Tuesday, June 7th 2016

Starting at 18:00

Doors at 17:30





* What (presentation):

&quot;The Tale of a Fameless but Widespread Vulnerability&quot; by Veit Hailperin
(Scip)


Two key components account for finding vulnerabilities of a certain class:
awareness of the vulnerability and ease of finding the vulnerability.
Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) vulnerabilities are not mentioned in the
de facto standard for public attention - the OWASP Top 10. Additionally
there is no publicly available tool to facilitate finding XSSI. The impact
reaches from leaking personal information stored, circumvention of
token-based protection to complete compromise of accounts. XSSI
vulnerabilities are fairly wide spread and the lack of detection increases
the risk of each XSSI. In this talk I am going to demonstrate how to find
XSSI, exploit XSSI and also how to protect against XSSI exploitation.

Pfingstweidstrasse 51

8005 Z&#252;rich

Rob
