Dear Mr. Ouhioun,
job advertisements are *not* allowed without prior discussion with the 
chapter leader (in this case me). Especially we don't accept recruiters 
on the list. If a company is looking for an AppSec professional in 
Switzerland, we're happy to talk to them and help finding the right 
people for the job.

Your client can contact me directly if interested but don't send out any 
other job ads.

Best regards,
Sven
