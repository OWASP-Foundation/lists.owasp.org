## What ##

We will have two presentations:

- - Will there be an IT Risk Management 2.0?
(Dr. Luke O'Connor, IT Risk Manager &amp; author of the No Tricks blog)

Many companies have for the last decade or so been applying some type of
risk-based approach for managing  their IT environments, and possibly
for supporting IT decision-making. There is a prolonged, and at times
heated, debate in  the IT community as to whether these risk-based
approaches have materially improved IT systems to perform their intended
business functions. In short, does IT management yield to the principles
of risk? There is a perception that IT Risk is fading away, not because
it has clearly failed but rather because it has not provided a magical
recipe to our IT ills. The effort of IT professionals seem better served
elsewhere, say in IT compliance, which has more defined business
benefits. Perhaps we  should just cut our losses at IT Risk Management
1.0 - thanks, but no thanks.

In this talk I will give my views on why IT Risk Management has not
lived up to its expectations, whether those expectations were
reasonable, and what the future might hold.

- - GlastopfNG - A web attack honeypot
(Sven Vetsch, Leader of the OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter)

GlastopfNG is a honeypot specialized in simulating a vulnerable web
server/application to become a target of automated and even manual
attacks. Instead of trying to block these attacks GlastopfNG tries to
get as much information as possible about the attacker and the used
attack itself. This gathered information can then be used in different
ways to protect real applications in the future against such attacks and
also to create statistics which can be used in research projects. This
presentation will give an introduction on why we need a tool like this,
how it works and how we can use the gathered information to make
statistics, help ISP customers or even steal a running botnet to DDoS
your evil neighbor.

Speaker bio: Sven aka. Disenchant is working as a senior security expert
and tester at Dreamlab Technologies in Bern with a main focus on web
technologies. He also leads the OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter and is a
board member of the ISSS (Information Security Society Switzerland).

## What to do now ##

Please add yourself to the following Doodle poll to let us know in
advance, how many people we have to expect.

If you would have dinner after the meeting, just add &quot;(d)&quot; to your name
to let me know if we have to reserve some tables.

Beste regards and see you next week,
Sven
