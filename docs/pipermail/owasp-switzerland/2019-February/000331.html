<PRE>Sorry everyone for the inconvenience/spam.
Various OWASP mailing lists are currently experiencing an increased amount of spam messages but we're working on it.

Have a great day

</I>&gt;<i> Hi!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you may have noticed, I sent you an email from your account.
</I>&gt;<i> This means that I have full access to your account.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been watching you for a few months now.
</I>&gt;<i> The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.
</I>&gt;<i> Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device.
</I>&gt;<i> This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why your antivirus did not detect malware?
</I>&gt;<i> Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched.
</I>&gt;<i> With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks.
</I>&gt;<i> I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to prevent this,
</I>&gt;<i> transfer the amount of $788 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: &quot;Buy Bitcoin&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1GoWy5yMzh3XXBiYxLU9tKCBMgibpznGio
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never hear me again.
</I>&gt;<i> I give you 48 hours to pay.
</I>&gt;<i> I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not make any mistakes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards!
