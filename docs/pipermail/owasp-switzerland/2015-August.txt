Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] Next OWASP Meeting (August 19th 2015)
Message-ID: <1438777050982.a7489@Nodemailer>

Hi everyone
We?ve found a solution for the next OWASP Switzerland meeting, taking place on August 19th 2015. Thanks to Rob we will be hosted by Swisscom in the center of Zurich (Pfingstweidstrasse 51, 8005 Z?rich / https://goo.gl/maps/dsZQc). Doors will be open at 17:30 and we will start at 18:00. If you?d like to join, please reserve your seat here: http://doodle.com/rmaifrfu4q3pqxav


Now for the content of the meeting:
We?ll try something new as nobody offered to give a full presentation. This OWASP Switzerland meeting will have to form of a small BarCamp (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp). That means everyone can bring a presentation which doesn?t have to be rocket science nor does it have to be even 10 minutes long or feature a fancy slide deck. If you ever wanted to share something AppSec related but can?t fill a full 45min presentation with it, now?s your chance. No registration for your talk/presentation/demo/? is necessary but if it takes more than 15min I would be interested in knowing about it before the meeting so I can make sure we?ll have enough time.


For the food aka. dinner we?ll be spontaneous as we don?t know at all how many presentations we?ll have and therefor when the meeting will come to an end :)


I hope to see all of you on August 19th and I?m looking forward to many different and interesting topics that will be presented.


PS: As usual the meeting is open to everyone and free of charge. So please don?t hesitate to share this invitation with anyone who might be interested in joining.


regards,
Sven
