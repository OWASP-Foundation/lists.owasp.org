<PRE>Hi everyone,
I'd like to invite you to next week's OWASP Switzerland Meeting, taking place on June 18th, 2013 18:30

DSwiss again offered a meeting room (thanks very much :) so we will meet at:

DSwiss AG
Badenerstrasse 281
CH-8003 Zurich

To know how many people we can expect, please fill in the Doodle poll we've created. If you'd also like to join the dinner after the meeting (most likely Italian food), it's *mandatory* to register through the poll before June 17th.

Topic of the meeting: &quot;JavaScript Security Issues&quot;

As usual it will be an open meeting and as nobody yet contacted me to give a presentation about the topic it will be again an open discussion and I'm looking forward to it to be just as interesting as the last one we had two months ago about security tools. Myself I hope to find the time to prepare a small demo of the custom JavaScript tracing mechanisms I sometimes use to analyze JavaScript code. If you also have something to show (doesn't need to be rocket science) or just a question you'd like to ask the crowd, please don't hesitate to bring it with you to the meeting.

Best regards,
Sven
