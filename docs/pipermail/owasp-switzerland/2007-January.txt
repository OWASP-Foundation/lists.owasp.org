Hi list members,
I'm very sorry about that but I've to cancel the OWASP Switzerland Local
Chapter Meeting which was planned for the next Thursday (11.01.2007).

The reason for that is, that Sandro didn't get an answer yet of the
people which are responsible for the room but a big thankyou to Sandro
for his engagement.

I hope this was the last time, we have to reschedule our meeting.

Now I'll try to manage that situation about the room with Sandro and
inform you as soon as we have some news.

Again, I'm very sorry about that.

Regards,
Sven

Hi list members,
I'm very happy to announce the first OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter
meeting after the kickoff we had in November.

Date:
12. February 2007

Time:
18:30

Where:
Zurich Financial Services
Mythenquai 20 / Zurich

We first meet at the main reception where Tobias Christen will meet us
and bring us to the meeting room, so please try to be on time :)

Who:
Everyone is welcome, so if you know someone who could be interested in
participate, ask him/her to come too :)

What:
- - Tweakfest
Give you an overview over an event called Tweakfest which I already
posted to the mailinglist. I've some good news for you there ;)

- - Presentation by Sven Vetsch
I'll do a presentation about a webapplication security related topic if
it's possible to prepare myself for that because I've got holidays
during the next week but shouldn't be a problem because I'm looking
forward to hold one of my "old" presentations which is still really
interesting I think.

- - Talking about the future of our Local Chapter
On the kickoff we talked about what everyone's goal is in the OWASP
Switzerland Local Chapter and now I think it's time to discuss about how
we can reach these goals.

This is just an overview of what I think would be
needed/fun/interesting, so feel free to bring your own ideas with you
and of course during the meeting we're absolutely free to change the
"program" anyway.

Last but not least, special thanks to Tobias Christen for organizing the
meeting room.

Looking forward to see all of you on the 12.02 :)

Regards,
Sven
