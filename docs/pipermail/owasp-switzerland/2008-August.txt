Hi everyone,
unfortunately I actually just get one offer for having a talk during our
next OWASP Meeting in Switzerland. Perhaps the reason for this where the
summer holidays most of you hopefully had. So please, if you have
something you can show the others, talk about or if you've got other
ideas, just let me know because we need at least one more presentation
or something similar to make the next meeting take place.

Keep in mind that our Local Chapter just can exist through your support.

Regards,
Sven

Hello Sven,

I am sorry but I didn't get the info for the next
meeting, when would it happen?

About the presentations, what would you need?
On my side, I eat "secure development" from breakfast
'til diner but I actually have no idea about what might
interest the other chapter members.

I don't know if I am the only one but there might be
other people in the chapter who feel in a similar position.

Best regards,
Antonio

Hi  Sven

How about an XML hands-on lab?

Theorie...
- Introduction In the use of web service In B2B environments and
backend integration
- Introduction into XML, DTD and XML Schema
- Shows attacks against XML generator and XML parser.
- Presents how the Xerces parsers can be hardened to prevent these attacks

Hands-on labs include excercises for...
- XML Injection
- XML URL enumeration
- XML directore traversal
- XML port scanning

What attendees should bring...
- Laptop
- Patch cable or WLAN card
- Firefox or Max's Backtrack

What the talk is not about...
- XML security standards and protocols (e.g. SAML)

I would be able to hold the presentation at nearly any day after Sun Sept 7th.

Regards,
Cyrill

Hi everyone,
the next OWASP meeting in Switzerland will take place on the 8.
September 2008. Sorry for not opening a doodle voting pool to find a
good date as usual but I had to fix this because of the speakers
possible time slots.

The meeting will take place in Zurich but I'm actually in the process of
organizing a meeting place.

Talks will be:
- - Quality of services for web applications (Hands-On Workshop)
- - XML Security (Hands-On Workshop)

And there will be a information slot about:
- - ISC2/Application security

If you're looking to come, it would be great if you could add yourself
to the following voting pool, just to let me know about how many people
we'll be there.
