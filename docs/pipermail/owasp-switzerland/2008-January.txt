Hi Sven,

Thanks for organizing the chapter meetings. My survey answers are:

1 b
2 e (I think 1x/quarter would be good.)
3 b
4 a (Although I don't know what the topic would be.)
5 d
6 I don't have any specific recommendations, but anything that I could use to get a few or our developers to come would be welcome.

Cheers,
John
