Hi everyone,
as you hopefully know, next Tuesday (8. February 2011) an OWASP Meeting
in Zurich was planned. Unfortunately we did not find a second speaker
beside of Kevin and so I decided to cancel the meeting.

Anyway, there will still be the DEFCON Beer on Tuesday (BoT) starting at
18:00 and I'll be there. Would be great to see also some OWASP guys.
More information on the BoT can be found here:
http://www.defcon-switzerland.org/

Sorry and best regards,
Sven

Hi OWASP Switzerland members

We invite you and others interested to join the Security Lunch "Cloud
Storage Security" on Feb 10, 12:00 - 14:00 in Zurich.

Luzius Meisser, CTO of cloud storage system provider Wuala, will explain how
they implemented provably secure storage by using elaborate cryptographic
techniques that combine client side strong data encryption with the
reliability of cloud storage.

This event is organized by the Information Security Society Switzerland
(ISSS) and there's no entrance fee. Sign up is required such that we can
preorder your lunch menu, which is paid by each participant directly to the
restaurant. The talk will be in German.

Event details and sign-up:

Best Regards,

Dr. Thomas D?bendorfer
President, ISSS
