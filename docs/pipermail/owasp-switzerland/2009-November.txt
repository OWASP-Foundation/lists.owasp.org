Dear Listers,

Last Saturday, Dave Wichers announced the first release candidate
for a highly anticipated OWASP project release: The OWASP Top 10 2010.

The Top 10 2010 describes the ten most critical risks commonly found
in vulnerable web applications. It describes what these risks consist of,
but also their corresponding threats, attack vectors, detection and corrective
measures and their impact.

For those used to the previous release (2007), the new release includes 2
changes in the list, which now consists of:

- A1: Injection
- A2: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
- A3: Broken Authentication and Session Management
- A4: Insecure Direct Object References
- A5: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- A6: Security Misconfiguration
- A7: Failure to Restrict URL Access
- A8:  Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards
- A9: Insecure Cryptographic Storage
- A10: Insufficient Transport Layer Protection

The 2010 release also shows a shift in the methodology, which now highly
focuses on a more risk-based approach.

While still in RC1 state, reading of this document is highly recommended and
as I hope, any discussion is welcomed on the OWASP-lists.

Best regards,

Antonio Fontes
