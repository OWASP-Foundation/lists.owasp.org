Hi list members,
in my mail from the 20.11.2006 I wrote, about an event in Zurich called
Tweakfest [1]. Yesterday, Patrick and me had a very interesting meeting
with the main organiser of this event. He's very interested in have
there a speech about the OWASP.

This is very cool for the whole OWASP and of course also for our Local
Chapter. It's a good chance to present what the OWASP is and at the same
time invite the people there to join our Local Chapter.

This are very great news I think and I'm sure that we're on the right
way to become an active OWASP Chapter here in Switzerland.

PS: We should discuss about that a bit more at the next meeting (see my
next mail).


Have a nice weekend :)


Regards,
Sven

Hi list members,
it's nearly one month ago since the kickoff meeting of our chapter, so I
think it's time for the next one. Because in the next few weeks there's
Christmas, New Year and every company is in a stressful time anyway, I
think we'll meet in January again.

If we do so, it would be very nice if someone can prepare himself for a
presentation, workshop or something else for the next meeting. If
someone is interested in doing that, please let me know :)

For a better organisation of the meetings I think we should have a
monthly meeting cycle, like the most other Local Chapters seems to have.
What do you think about the first day "X" (Monday, Thuesday, ...) of
each month to start the new month with something interesting? I've set
up a doodle voting pool [1] again so you can vote for the days which
would be ok for you (the voting pool will be active for two weeks
starting today). The starting time of the meetings would be about 19:00
I guess and then we can meet for about 2 or 3 hours which means that
we'll finish between 21:00 and 22:00 so (hopefully) everyone should be
able to come home and get enough sleep for the next day.

If someone have other ideas about feature meetings (also other ideas
abut the meeting cycle), please don't hesitate to send them to the list.

Hi list members,
as you (hopefully) see, now you get the two mails I've sent to the list.
This means, that the mailinglist works again and so you can post to it
as usual.

FYI: Here's the response I've got from Larry which is the guy who's
responsible for the technical infrastructur of the OWASP:

Sven,

This would be possible if the queue was to get stuck. I reset the queue
and you should receive those emails and any others you may have missed
in the next few hours.

Thanks

Sorry again for the time, the ML was offline.

Sven

Hi list members,
as I wrote in my mail from the 10.12.2006 [1] I've set up a voting pool
and it was now open for two weeks.

Unfortunately there were only three votes and I don't know why the
others didn't vote. Now the voting has finished and so I'll take the
result of these three votes which means for all of us:

The OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter will meet in the future every first
Thursday of each month and the meeting will take place in Zurich because
of another voting pool we had.


So, the next meeting should take place on the 4th of January but I think
many of you will be in Holidays then so I think we should move it for
this time to the second Thursday of January which is the 11.01.2007 and
the starting time will be 19:00.

When Sandro can reserve a room again for this meeting I think everything
should be fine.

@ Sandro
Please let the others and me know if you can get a room for this date
again or not.

As usual if there are any problems with something, don't hesitate to
contact me :)

PS: If nobody wants to do a presentation/workshop/... at the next
meeting I can bring one of my "old" presentations :)


Wish you all a happy new Year.


Regards,
Sven
