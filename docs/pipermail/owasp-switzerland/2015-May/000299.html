* What (presentation):
&quot;XSLT Processing Security and Server Side Request Forgeries&quot; by Roland Bischofberger and Emanuel Duss


Abstract:
An XSLT processor is a piece of software for manipulating XML files or
transforming them into other file formats. These XSLT processors are
very feature rich, which makes them interessting in the context of
information security. For example it is possible to include other files
or even run commands. These processors enable you also to perform so
called Server Side Request Forgeries (SSRF). SSRF is a technique which
triggers a request on the vulnerable host. So it is possible for an
attacker to access remote machines which are not directly available for
the attacker.
In a student project at the Hochschule f&#252;r Technik Rapperswil (HSR), we
did some testing on vulnerabilities of XSLT processors and the ability
to use them for SSRF. In our talk we will present the test results and
show a live demonstration. You will see which processor is vulerable
against which vulnerabilities and what a developer can do to use them
safely.
