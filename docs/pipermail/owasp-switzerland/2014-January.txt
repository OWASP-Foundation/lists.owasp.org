Hi all,

Currently I am trying to complete our past meetings wiki page 
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Switzerland#tab=Past_Meetings). To make 
our wiki more interesting, I have already adapted its composition and 
added the slides from Sven and Alexandre (a big thank you to the two of 
you). If you do have or know about other presentations (or just the name 
of a person who has been talking at a specific date) please let me know.
Additionally, I will try to add future slides to this page and inform 
about it on Facebook (and maybe also on twitter).
Thank you for your help in advance.

Regards and a late happy new year,
Rob

Hi All

Representatives from OWASP were due to give secure code training at the
upcoming RSA conference. However, in view of the alleged links between
RSA and the NSA, a big debate took place on the OWASP leader mailing
list. In the end, OWASP decided to pull  out of the training.

Hi everyone,
just to make things clear for the ones who didn't follow the whole debate that was going on:

If it would have been only for the RSA/NSA story (true or not) OWASP would have delivered the training as the majority of the involved OWASP members decided that the benefit for the people  who will learn about secure development is higher rated than making a statement agains something we don't have full proof of. After this was nearly decided as a final result, Eoin sent a mail [1] to the leader list that changed everything. RSA apparently tried to restrict OWASP on where else we could deliver such a training and requested a public excuse from Eoin for a tweet he made. It was then decided, that such requests are completely against the openness OWASP stands for and therefor resulted in Eoin and Jim pulling out of the RSA conference.

Currently OWASP tries to find another venue so people interested in the free secure development training would still be able to attend.

S-SDLC ? Ready for Clouds? (by Robert Schneider, Swisscom IT Services AG)
Intellectual Property Scan, Code Review, Vulnerability Scanning and Stress & Volume Testing
Many companies have it (somehow) and numerous are planning to implement one ? a Secure Software Development Life Cycle (S-SDLC). As Swisscom is building a new Cloud, the whole S-SDLC had to be reconsidered to match the new challenges. In this presentation I would like to give you an overview of the four fundamental phases that we plan to implement in our new S-SDLC (Intellectual Property Scan, Code Review, Vulnerability Scanning and Stress & Volume Testing) as well as an idea of what these phases are meant to do. Additionally, I would like to give you an idea of what possible candidates (i.e. tools) could be of interest for you and where we see the biggest pitfalls so far. As this is a considerable topic, I hope that you bring with you many questions, answers as well as your own experiences to share with each other.

Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] Zurich Subcontracting opportunity
Message-ID: <ECF20250-935F-44CF-85A2-D370581743CC@hp.com>

Hello OWASP Schweiz!

I come to you from Fortify, the static analysis company and a part of Hewlett-Packard software.

I have an opportunity coming up in a few months, for approximately 60 days on-site work in Zurich, assessing a number of applications with Fortify SCA.

Good candidates will speak good business German, will be legal to work in Switzerland, and will be well qualified Fortify SCA consultants.  And that means:
 - Prior development experience, in at least two development languages, AND (
 - Prior experience with static analysis or manual code review for security vulnerabilities; OR
 - Strong interest in application security and in deconstructing technical systems )

Thanks for reading my spam :)  Please contact me via email if you believe you are a suitable candidate.

Doug
