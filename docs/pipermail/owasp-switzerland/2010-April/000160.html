<PRE>Hello List

This is a follow-up to the talk I gave at the OWASP chapter meeting on 
April 12th in Zurich where I briefly outlined some strategic OWASP projects.

On April 19th, OWASP officially released the &quot;OWASP Top 10 for 2010&quot; 
list of Application Security Risks.
This list can be found at:

    *      <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project</A>

OWASP wants to raise awareness of the Top 10 as widely as possible. As 
part of this effort, I have volunteered to visit organisations (e.g. 
companies, universities) in Switzerland to give a short talk on the 
subject. The talk would be of interest to anyone involved in the 
application security lifecycle (developers). It would take less than one 
hour, and is free.

Interested? Please get in touch with any questions or to arrange a time. 
For those in the Z&#252;rich area, I am already booked to give this talk in 
the city on Tuesday 11th May around midday, so would be happy to drop by 
your company that morning or late afternoon--let me know.

Thanks

Alexis FitzGerald

/A bit about me:/
I have worked for a good number of years in the application security 
sector in Dublin, Ireland - and continue to do so, thanks to the wonders 
of the Internet.  My wife and I recently moved to Beatenberg, BE, which 
is why I want to become involved in OWASP Switzerland.
