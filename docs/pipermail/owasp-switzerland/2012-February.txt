Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] OWASP Meeting - 14. February 2012
Message-ID: <4F2AA4C1.4040408@owasp.org>

Hi everyone,
I hereby like to invite you to the next OWASP Switzerland Meeting.

This time we decided to not strictly focus on web related security
issues, as OWASP covers all application security related areas.

* What:
"Analysis of the RSA Security Breach" by Gianni Gnesa

Several posts have been written and several talks have been given
about the RSA Security Breach, but none of these posts or talks have
ever explained in detail the attack. This talk will analyze each part
of the attack, from the malicious excel file to the 0day used to
install a backdoor into an RSA employee's PC. Finally, I will give
some recommendations on how to protect your IT infrastructure and
minimize the impact of 0days.

Gianni Gnesa is a security researcher who works for Ptrace Security, a
Swiss-based company dedicate to providing information security
solutions.

If someone else can offer an additional short talk 5-30min, please let
me (Sven) know.

* When:
14th February 2012
Starting at 17:00

* Where:
Rheinfelder Bierhalle
Niederdorfstrasse 76
8001 Z?rich
(http://bit.ly/pl8KZp)

Please *don't* use the main entrance. There's a small door to the right
which leads to a room upstairs.

* Who:
As usual, all of our meetings are open to everyone and it's free of
charge. Still we would kindly ask you to add yourself (no real name
needed) to the following Doodle so we know how many attendees to expect.

Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] XSS & CSRF: Practical exploitation of
	post-authentication vulnerabilities in web applications
Message-ID: <003c01cce254$9f325d30$dd971790$@htbridge.ch>

Hello,

 

2 weeks ago, we have published a technical article regarding the
exploitation of a few vulnerabilities that we have disclosed last year.
Indeed, these alerts have been criticized by a self-proclaimed security
expert in US who thought it was only ?design features?, thus spreading
misinformation among unaware people. We therefore decided to shed light on
this story and explain people that our alerts really dealt with true
vulnerabilities, and that it is in their interest do apply patches.

 

This technical article has been written by our head of R&D, who was one of
the first author of Web Applications Attacks book, and it will hopefully
rise awareness by demonstrating that post-authentication vulnerabilities are
quite often underestimated in the IT Security field. It has been published
by Pentest Magazine, and the teaser is available for free on their website.
As suggested by Sven VETSCH, I thought that OWASP?s readers would have been
interested by this article
 So please feel free to share this knowledge.

Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] SANS Mentoring Zurich
Message-ID: <4F4B8BB4.8010507@owasp.org>

Hi everyone,
I'd like to announce, that there will be a SANS class (504 Hacker
Techniques, Exploits & Incident Handling) in the Zurich area in April
and OWASP Members will get a 10% discount.

At http://www.sans.org/mentor/details.php?nid=27061 or in the attached
flyer you'll find more information about the class. If you'd like to
attend, please contact Luis Rocha (luiscrocha _at_ gmail.com) to get
your discount code.

HINT: If you're not an OWASP Member yet but want to attend the class,
you should definitely join OWASP as the yearly membership fee is less
than the discount you get as a member :)
