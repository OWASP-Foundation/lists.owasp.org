Hi everyone,
we're still looking for at least one speaker for the next OWASP
Switzerland Meeting on the 14th June. We already have one talk but it's
not yet completely confirmed and I'd like to to have at least one talk.

If you have anything AppSec related to present or know someone who has,
please let me know.

Best regards,
Sven

Hi everyone,
as we unfortunately still don't have a speaker for the next OWASP
Switzerland Meeting, I'd like to try something new: Lightning Talks.

The concept is simple: If you have anything AppSec related to share,
independent if it's about a tool you like, a metric, a paper, research,
or whatever, you'll have around *10min* to present it to the crowd. This
way, also people who don't have a topic which fits into a normal
presentation slot will have a chance to talk.

If you have something to talk about, please either enter your name and
presentation title at http://techup.ch/111/owasp-switzerland-meeting
(only for people with a Twitter account) or send me a short mail with
the mentioned information.

Best regards,
Sven
