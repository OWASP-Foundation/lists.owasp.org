Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] Don't trust the DOM: Breaking XSS mitigations
	via Script Gadgets
Message-ID: <5bc04ab0.1c69fb81.597cb.1bb6@mx.google.com>

Hi folks!
We offer you the opportunity to enjoy and benefit from the upcoming Google Research Talk in the field of Web Security.


It is MANDATORY to register for the event via Googles official registration form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsz_d6Hsq8tDFlWuyK8I2ZYlavN7B62eU1dccZ1cgg0EATnQ/viewform


Cross-Site Scripting is a constant problem of the Web platform. Over the years many techniques have been introduced to prevent or mitigate XSS. Most of these techniques, thereby, focus on script tags and event handlers. HTML sanitizers, for example, aim at removing potentially dangerous tags and attributes. Another example is the Content Security Policy, which forbids inline event handlers and aims at white listing of legitimate scripts.

In this talk, we present a novel Web hacking technique that enables an attacker to circumvent most XSS mitigations. In order to do so, the attacker abuses so-called script gadgets. A script gadget Is a legitimate piece of JavaScript in a page that reads elements from the DOM via selectors and processes them in a way that results in script execution. To abuse a script gadget, the attacker injects a benign looking element into the page that matches the gadget's selector. Subsequently, the gadget selects the benign-looking element and executes attacker-controlled scripts. As the initially injected element is benign it passes HTML sanitizers and security policies. The XSS only surfaces when the gadget mistakenly elevates the privileges of the element.

In this talk, we will demonstrate that these gadgets are present in almost all modern JavaScript libraries, APIs and applications. We will present several case studies and real-world examples that demonstrate that many mitigation techniques are not suited for modern applications. As a result, we argue that the Web should start focusing more on preventive mechanisms instead of mitigations.

Speaker:
Sebastian Lekies is a senior software engineer and a web security researcher at Google. He is specializing in client-side web application security and automated web application security testing. At Google, Sebastian is a Tech Lead of the web security scanning and the security inventory teams. Before joining Google, Sebastian was part of SAP?s Security Research team, where he conducted academic research in the area of client-side Web application security. He is regularly speaking at academic and non-academic security conferences such as BlackHat US/EU/Asia, OWASP AppSec EU, DeepSec, Usenix Security, CCS, and many more.

Agenda:
17:30 - Doors will open
18:00 - Start

Who:
As usual, all our meetings are open to everyone and free of charge.

Afterwards:

Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] Swiss Cyber Strom - 30.10.2018 in Bern
Message-ID: <5bc790bd.1c69fb81.9ef4.76bb@mx.google.com>

Hi folks,
On the 30th October 2018 the next Swiss Cyber Strom conference is going to happen in Bern, Switzerland. 
Teaser:
It?s all about trust?at Swiss Cyber Storm 2018! Our keynote speaker, the renowned Canadian author and privacy activist Cory Doctorow, will present us his view on trust. J?r?my Matos will explain how social engineers manipulate smartphone contacts to gain the trust of their victims. And world-famous E-Health expert Marie Moe will tell us her story how she had to learn to trust the code that runs her pace maker. Check out our schedule for a variety of talks on trust and other real world security problems:?www.swisscyberstorm.com/schedule/
If you are thinking about attending, but do not like to check the whole schedule, here are some talks that could be of interest for an OWASP interested person like you are:
? Marie Moe: Security of EHealth / IoT
? Ivan Risti?: Erfahrungen mit SSL Labs und Ausblick auf Hardenize
? Nick Sullivan von Cloudflare: Wie neue Standards im Web die Sicherheit beeinflussen (Multicast CDNs, HTTP/2, etc.)
? Katherine Jarmul: Neuer Angriffsvektor auf Machine Learning: Wie man von den fertigen Modellen wieder zur?ck auf die Trainingsdaten rechnen kann.
As a community partner, OWASP Switzerland may help you out with a 10% discount. Simply use the code ?OWASP? for this.
Looking forward to meeting some of you there.
Best,
Rob
