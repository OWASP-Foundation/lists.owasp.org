Hi everyone,
it's amazing to see, that already 35 people have registered for the
OWASP Meeting next week :)

Unfortunately I have to announce, that we can't take more registrations
because the meeting location is already overbooked and Tobias is doing
his best to organize enough chairs.

If you want to attend the meeting but aren't registered yet, let me know
directly by mail so I can inform you if any seat becomes free and if
someone can't make it to the meeting *please* also let me know asap.

Best regards,
Sven

Hallo Sven

Muss leider meine Anmeldung f?r den Montag zur?ckziehen. Sonst bin ich 
ein Kopf k?rzer.. Meine Regierung hat den Montag schon anders verplant.

W?nsche trotzdem viel Spass am Montag.. Dienstag werde ich 
voraussichtlich in ZH sein am BoT.

Gruess, M?nu

Subject: [Owasp-switzerland] OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter - Updates
Message-ID: <4BCC9F11.5030803@disenchant.ch>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hi everyone,
one week ago we had our last OWASP meeting in Zurich and it was a great
success with more people than we had ever before at a meeting. Thanks to
all of you who made this possible.

To make the future meetings even better and to get more attendees, there
are two updates I'd like to inform you about:

- - From now on, Tobias Christen will assist me in leading the OWASP
Switzerland Local Chapter. Our long time goal here is to build a small
board of about 2-3 people who are responsible for our chapter.

- - We're actually preparing a Local Chapter survey with a few questions
to hear from you what we need to improve and also what you like at the
meetings. I'll send out another mail as soon as it's online. (don't
worry, it will take only about 5-10 minutes to participate)

Best regards and thanks for your support,
Sven

Hi everyone,
as announced, Tobias and I prepared a small survey to improve the
quality of our OWASP Local Chapter Meetings.

You can find the survey at:
http://tinyurl.com/owasp-ch-survey

It will take only about 5 minutes and I'm asking all of you to
participate in the survey. We're especially interested in your feedback
at the bottom of it.

Thanks for your support and best regards,
Sven

Subject: [Owasp-switzerland] OWASP Switzerland - Top 10 for 2010 Talk
Message-ID: <4BD549E4.6050909@iol.ie>

Hello List

This is a follow-up to the talk I gave at the OWASP chapter meeting on 
April 12th in Zurich where I briefly outlined some strategic OWASP projects.

On April 19th, OWASP officially released the "OWASP Top 10 for 2010" 
list of Application Security Risks.
This list can be found at:

    *      http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project

OWASP wants to raise awareness of the Top 10 as widely as possible. As 
part of this effort, I have volunteered to visit organisations (e.g. 
companies, universities) in Switzerland to give a short talk on the 
subject. The talk would be of interest to anyone involved in the 
application security lifecycle (developers). It would take less than one 
hour, and is free.

Interested? Please get in touch with any questions or to arrange a time. 
For those in the Z?rich area, I am already booked to give this talk in 
the city on Tuesday 11th May around midday, so would be happy to drop by 
your company that morning or late afternoon--let me know.

Thanks

Alexis FitzGerald

/A bit about me:/
I have worked for a good number of years in the application security 
sector in Dublin, Ireland - and continue to do so, thanks to the wonders 
of the Internet.  My wife and I recently moved to Beatenberg, BE, which 
is why I want to become involved in OWASP Switzerland.
