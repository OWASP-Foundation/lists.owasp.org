Hi everyone,
I'd like to announce, that we now have found a speaker for our next meeting on April 9th (http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-switzerland/2014-March/000270.html). Dobin Rutishauser of Compass Security stepped in and will give a presentation on a very interesting and in my opinion much underrated topic - SSL/TLS.

Title:
"SSL/TLS jungle - bringing light into the cipher forest"

Abstract:
"The protocols SSL and TLS are widely used to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over insecure networks. As every implementation of crypto algorithms, they come in different versions, and can contain a multitude of errors, faults and configuration options. This talk will shed some light into SSL/TLS basics, and will discuss topics like the secure configuration of the TLS/SSL stack regarding to attacks like BEAST or PRISM, what the impact of Perfect Forward Secrecy is or why nobody should use RC4."


PS: If you haven't done so already, please don't forget to register for the meeting at http://doodle.com/c6sbg6yya498cuwy

Best regards,
Sven

Just to let everyone know: There are no seats left for the meeting. So if you just fill in your name and didn't select the meeting option (or only the "& Dinner"), there's unfortunately no seat reserved for you at the meeting. I just wanted to make this clear, as I'm now seeing people filling in their names without selecting an option. Of course you can still join the dinner but a registration is mandatory too.

Best regards,
Sven
