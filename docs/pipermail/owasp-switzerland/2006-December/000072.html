(The following mail was already sent yesterday but it seems that not
everyone / or nobody on the ML received it, that's why I send it again)

Hi list members,
it's nearly one month ago since the kickoff meeting of our chapter, so I
think it's time for the next one. Because in the next few weeks there's
Christmas, New Year and every company is in a stressful time anyway, I
think we'll meet in January again.

If we do so, it would be very nice if someone can prepare himself for a
presentation, workshop or something else for the next meeting. If
someone is interested in doing that, please let me know :)

For a better organisation of the meetings I think we should have a
monthly meeting cycle, like the most other Local Chapters seems to have.
What do you think about the first day &quot;X&quot; (Monday, Thuesday, ...) of
each month to start the new month with something interesting? I've set
up a doodle voting pool [1] again so you can vote for the days which
would be ok for you (the voting pool will be active for two weeks
starting today). The starting time of the meetings would be about 19:00
I guess and then we can meet for about 2 or 3 hours which means that
we'll finish between 21:00 and 22:00 so (hopefully) everyone should be
able to come home and get enough sleep for the next day.

If someone have other ideas about feature meetings (also other ideas
abut the meeting cycle), please don't hesitate to send them to the list.
