Hi list members,
as I wrote in my mail from the 10.12.2006 [1] I've set up a voting pool
and it was now open for two weeks.

Unfortunately there were only three votes and I don't know why the
others didn't vote. Now the voting has finished and so I'll take the
result of these three votes which means for all of us:

The OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter will meet in the future every first
Thursday of each month and the meeting will take place in Zurich because
of another voting pool we had.


So, the next meeting should take place on the 4th of January but I think
many of you will be in Holidays then so I think we should move it for
this time to the second Thursday of January which is the 11.01.2007 and
the starting time will be 19:00.

When Sandro can reserve a room again for this meeting I think everything
should be fine.

@ Sandro
Please let the others and me know if you can get a room for this date
again or not.

As usual if there are any problems with something, don't hesitate to
contact me :)

PS: If nobody wants to do a presentation/workshop/... at the next
meeting I can bring one of my &quot;old&quot; presentations :)


Wish you all a happy new Year.


Regards,
Sven
