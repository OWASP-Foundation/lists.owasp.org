Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] OWASP Switzerland Reboot - Summary
Message-ID: <EBEF4396-026F-41C8-97A5-2AD436099031@owasp.org>

Hi everyone,
I'd like to deliver a short summary of the OWASP Switzerland Reboot meeting, that was held on March 12th 2013 in Zurich.

First of all, thanks to everyone who showed up. It was great to have >10 people joining in to discuss the future of OWASP Switzerland. One if not the most important point we discussed was, that we want to go back to the bi-monthly meeting we once had. The content of the meeting on the other hand will be more flexible as we plan to not only invite speakers to give a presentation but also to have discussions about the AppSec related questions that bother us. This of course doesn't mean, that you shouldn't contact me (Sven) if you have something interesting to present to the attendees. So how will this discussion thing work? Very simple. You can find a Google spreadsheet at http://bit.ly/ZpR0lZ where you can fill in what topics you'd like OWASP Switzerland to choose for the meetings. For every month we will then choose one topic and have an open but (slightly) moderated discussion about it and perhaps we even find someone who can give a short presentation related to the topic to get the discussion started. Will this work? We don't know until we try but we all agreed, that it would be a waste to not use those meetings to learn as much from each other as possible. Something else we decided was, that the main audience will be security people and we're ok with it but of course, developers, managers and everybody else is highly welcome to join at any time.

Some more information about future meetings:
The meetings will take place every second month (next one on April 9th 2013) and most likely only in Zurich but we're open for Bern if enough people say so. Starting time for meetings will if nothing else is written in the announcement on this mailinglist 18:30 and after the "official" part, we will have dinner at a place nearby (reservation will be necessary). This also means, that we won't combine future meetings with the DEFCON Switzerland Beer on Tuesday (BoT) anymore. The reason for this is, that the overlap between the two groups was just too small in the past and it somewhat kills the possible discussions after presentations etc. when people who didn't attend the presentation walk in five minutes after it has ended.

And as a side note if you have to convince your colleagues or even yourself to join our meetings: We'll try our best to provide free beer during every meeting ;)

This were more or less the most important things we talked about and decided during the reboot meeting. If there are any questions, don't hesitate to contact me and also don't forget to put your topics/questions into the spreadsheet i mentioned (http://bit.ly/ZpR0lZ).

Best regards,
Sven

Hi everyone, hallo OWASP-Kollegen/innen in der Schweiz,

we are pleased to invite you to a new project: 'Top 10 Developer Edition'.
I am sorry but the initial version will be in German. We will take care to
make a migration to other languages easy.

Wir freuen uns, ein neues Projekt vorzustellen:
          'OWASP Top 10 f?r Entwickler'

Beim OWASP Day 2012 in M?nchen entstand die Idee, eine Version der OWASP
Top 10 f?r Entwickler zu erstellen. Sie soll die Top 10 mit Beispielen aus
anderen OWASP-Projekten (z.B. den Cheat-Sheets), dem BSI etc anreichern und
es Entwicklern noch einfacher machen, die Top 10 umzusetzen. Das Dokument
soll f?r Schulungen und als Nachschlagewerk geeignet sein.

Geplanter Inhalt:

   -  Problem verstehen (aus OWASP Top 10 2010 - German PDF, 'Master' f?r
   das Dokument, gleiches Aussehen wie das englische Top_10_2010-Wiki (gepl:
   Top_10_2013)), ggf. etwas mehr Platz f?r Erkl?rungen als in der
   Original-Version.
   -  wie programmiere ich richtig (mit Quelltext-Beispiel(en) (zun?chst
   Java, weitere Sprachen sind vorbereitet)),
   -  wo finde ich mehr Infos => Cheat Sheets, BSI: IT-Grundschutz Baustein
   Webanwendungen' etc.


Mehr Infos/Additional Information:
Projektbeschreibung/Project Info:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_10_fuer_Entwickler
Erste Seiten gibt es auch schon, z.B.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Germany/Projekte/Top_10_fuer_Entwickler/A1_Injection

Wir suchen Leute, die Lust & Zeit haben mitzumachen, oder uns einfach
Beispiele, gute oder schlechte Erfahrungen ?ber 'Umsetzungshilfen', wie den
Cheat-Sheets, ESAPI etc zusenden. Auch ?ber Reviewpartner w?rden wir uns
sehr freuen.

Alle an dem Projekt Interessierten bitte ich, sich auf der
Mailingliste* *anzumelden:
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp_top_10_fuer_entwickler

Viele Gr??e / kind regards / Amit?s

Hi everyone,
I'd like to invite you to the next OWASP Switzerland Meeting, taking place on April 9th 2013, 18:30

DSwiss offered a meeting room (thanks very much :) so we will meet at:

DSwiss AG
Badenerstrasse 281
CH-8003 Zurich

To know how many people we can expect, please fill in the Doodle poll we've created. If you'd also like to join the dinner after the meeting (most likely Italian food), it's *mandatory* to register through the poll before April 8th.
http://doodle.com/z45czdfb3bxbfhf7


So what will the content of the meeting be? I shamelessly just took the first idea submitted to our topic list (fill in your topic ideas at http://bit.ly/ZpR0lZ). In all meetings starting with this one, we'll do a short voting to decide which will be the topic for the meeting two months later.

Topic of the meeting: Tools (not) to use

All of us are probably using several OWASP and non-OWASP tools for appsec tasks. However there are almost certainly some tools which more of us use and therefore others should know about. Maybe there exist also some tools that we all heard about but never tried ? but another one already did and can share his experience. In addition we might also talk about what features do you (dis)like about a tool and/or do you have some magic tricks/hints for one of the tools.

The whole thing will be done in form of an open discussion (let's give it a try and see how it works). In addition, if you can give a 5-10min presentation/demonstration about your favorite tool or a special hidden feature, please let me know in advance so we can make sure that we integrate it into the meeting.

PS: Free beer will be available ;)

Happy easter and best regards,
Sven
