Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] OWASP Meeting TOMORROW
Message-ID: <3E02CD59-BA5B-4A5D-8E16-1961AD89583E@owasp.org>

Hi everyone,
I know it's last minute but I really wasn't able to do this earlier: Tomorrow the next OWASP Switzerland Meeting is planned. Rather than a normal meeting, we'll just have dinner and have the discussions right there. The topic during dinner will be "Real-World experiences in developer security/awareness training". I hope some of you are also interested in sharing their experiences.

Dinner will be at 18:00 (if you arrive some minutes earlier/later - no problem). If you'd like to join, please register at http://doodle.com/mht8gkb6ak7yaqpp before August 20th 2013 12:00. I'll reserve an Italian restaurant not too far from the Zurich mainstation. I'll announce the details tomorrow on this mailing list.

Best regards,
Sven
