* Call for Papers
----------------------------------------------------------------

The SECURWARE 2007 (International Conference on Emerging Security Information
Systems and Technologies) is an event covering related topics on theory and
practice on security, cryptography, secure protocols, trust, privacy,
confidentiality, vulnerability, intrusion detection and other areas related to
low enforcement, security data mining, malware models, etc.

Security, defined for ensuring protected communication among terminals and user
applications across public and private networks, is the core for guaranteeing
confidentiality, privacy, and data protection. Security affects business and
individuals, raises the business risk, and requires a corporate and individual
culture. In the open business space offered by Internet, it is a need to
improve defences against hackers, disgruntled employees, and commercial rivals.
There is a required balance between the effort and resources spent on security
versus security achievements. Some vulnerability can be addressed using the
rule of 80:20, meaning 80% of the vulnerabilities can be addressed for 20% of
the costs. Other technical aspects are related to the communication speed
versus complex and time consuming cryptography/security mechanisms and
protocols.

As a multi-track event, SECURWARE 2007 will serve as a forum for researchers
from the academia and the industry, professionals, standard developers, policy
makers and practitioners to exchange ideas. The topics could be on techniques
and applications, best practices, awareness and experiences as well as future
trends and needs (both in research and practices) related to all aspects of
information security, security systems and technologies.
 
We welcome technical papers presenting research and practical results, position
papers addressing the pros and cons of specific proposals, such as those being
discussed in the standard fora or in industry consortia, survey papers
addressing the key problems and solutions on any of the above topics short
papers on work in progress, and panel proposals.

The topics suggested by the conference can be discussed in term of concepts,
state of the art, standards, implementations, running experiments and
applications. Authors are invited to submit complete unpublished papers, which
are not under review in any other conference or journal in the following, but
not limited topic areas. Industrial presentations are not subject to these
constraints. Tutorials on specific related topics and panels on challenging
areas are encouraged.  

* Technical marketing/business/positioning presentations
----------------------------------------------------------------
The conference initiates a series of business, technical marketing, and
positioning presentations on the same topics. Speakers must submit a 10-12
slide deck presentations with substantial notes accompanying the slides, in the
.ppt format (.pdf-ed). The slide deck will be published in the conference's CD
collection, together with the regular papers. Please send your presentations to
petre at iaria.org and lourdes at disca.upv.es.

* Tutorials
----------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorials provide overviews of current high interest topics. Proposals can be
for half or full day tutorials. Please send your proposals to petre at iaria.org
and lourdes at disca.upv.es.

* Panel proposals
----------------------------------------------------------------
The organizers encourage scientists and industry leaders to organize dedicated
panels dealing with controversial and challenging topics and paradigms. Panel
moderators are asked to identify their guests and manage that their appropriate
talk supports timely reach our deadlines. Moderators must specifically submit an
official proposal, indicating their background, panelist names, their
affiliation, the topic of the panel, as well as short biographies. Contact
petre at iaria.org and lourdes at disca.upv.es.

* Workshop proposals 
----------------------------------------------------------------
We welcome workshop proposals on issues complementary to the topics of this
conference. Your requests should be forwarded to petre at iaria.org and
lourdes at disca.upv.es

Subject: [Owasp-switzerland] Invitation - Breach Security Cocktail Party in
	Milan
Message-ID: <464068C0.3030407@disenchant.ch>

Hi everyone,
most of you might already know that from the 15.-17. Mai the AppSec
Conference will take place in Milan. I've just get an invitation by Ofer
Shezaf who's the CTO of Breach Security and also the chair of the OWASP
Israel Local Chapter to a cocktail party. He also asked me to send the
invitation to the OWASP ML in Switzerland too, to invite other people
who will be in Milan.

The invitation's attached to this mail and if some of you will be there,
let me know so that we can have a beer or a cocktail together :)

Regards,
Sven

Hi list members,
as I've already announced a few times, we'll have two talks at the
Tweakfest 2007 (http://tweakfest.ch) in Zurich. The event will take
place from 24. to 26. Mai - so it's this week.

For the people who are interested, the two OWASP talks on Friday 25. Mai
are for free for you. You can find all information about the talks here:
http://tweakfest.ch/festival/2007/program/program_de.php?id=workshop?2

The first talk is for free anyway and the second one normally needs a
"Professional Ticket". If you'd like to come please drop me a mail so
that I know who will be there. If there are any problems you can also
call me on my mobile under +41 (0)79 466 37 08.

Hope to see you at the Tweakfest :)

Regards,
Sven
