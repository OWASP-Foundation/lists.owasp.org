Hello Switzerland

I am interested to learn about web application scanners. Did you use one
of those? Are they worth the money (do they know AJAX etc)? Where could I
learn more about them (do you have any good links to reviews)?

Thanks for your help.

Regards,
Adrian

Hi Adrian

These tools are good for finding low hanging fruits, like known problematic
URLs and simple variants of XSS and SQL-Injection.

But they often fail on web applications with wizards or where correct data
has to be filled in to advance within the application. Also difficult to
detect is SQL injection in cases where there is no database SQL error
message displayed. Authorization issues and business logic flaws in
applications are also hard to detect, because they depend on data which must
semantically be correct. 

I have personally used Paros Proxy (Open Source) and N-Stealth (Commercial).
Although Paros is not very advanced it helps you not to forget test cases
and allows you to scan large sites for XSS bugs. If a bug is found you have
full access to the request which triggered the problem. So reproducing an
issue is simple.

I haven't seen the newest version of N-Stealth lately but when I was testing
with it I have rarely found a severe issue with it. It is a tool which
blindly tests known URLs of admin consoles and the like. Another issue is
that it won't show you the exact request which triggered the problem. So
reproducing an issue can be difficult. Based on my experience I would not
buy it anymore.

You should also keep in mind that depending on the web server configuration
it can happen that you get lots of false positives which you will have to
analyze manually.

With all that in mind I would not solely depend on the results of these
tools. I prefer a mixed approach: Manual hacking, source code and
configuration inspection, scanning and interview. Depending on the class of
problem I choose the most efficient approach. 

There are other things to write about these tools but I spare you the
details. If you have further questions feel free to ask.

Kind regards
Jan P. Monsch

Hi Adrian,
unfortunately I don't had the possibility to test the newest version of
any of the big commercial WebAppSec scanners out there yet so I can't
give my own feedback on them here but perhaps one of the following links
could help you:

Jordan Wiens did a quiet good job on reviewing the most popular
WebAppSec scanners out there. Perhaps you'll find something interesting
there:
http://www.networkcomputing.com/rollingreviews/Web-Applications-Scanners/

The "Web Application Security Consortium" (WASC) has recently started a
project called "Web Application Security Scanner Evaluation Criteria"
but nothing is released yet. I think this might become a very good
resource for information like you're looking for in the near future:
http://webappsec.org/projects/wassec/

Just as an additional hint, Acunetix has released a free XSS scanner
which you can use but AFAIK it has no JavaScript or as you asked for,
"AJAX-Support":
http://www.acunetix.com/cross-site-scripting/scanner.htm

- From my point of view it really depends on your needs, which scanner is
the one you should use for your work but I also fully agree with Jan ("I
prefer a mixed approach: Manual hacking, source code and configuration
inspection, scanning and interview.").

Btw. perhaps you should ask such a question also to the OWASP Testing ML
(https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing) because there
are much more WebAppSec pentesters and also some scanner developers :)

Regards,
Sven

Hi,

I recently had the chance to go to a Gartner Conference, where they
also talked about this subject.

They believe that AppSec Scanners are a strategic "must do" for
companies, as the bad guys will have the same tools and you don't want
to end wit a low hanging fruit not been found by yourself.
They believe that you can have less skilled persons using these tools,
I persoanlly am not convinced of that, when you consider reading the
reports also part of the game.
They difference between "dynamic testing" => scanning given
applications from outside (eg AppScan) and "static testing" =>
scanning source code or even binaries (eg Fortify). Static testing
tools should be integrated in developer environments (eg Eclipse).

Regarding quality they claim that all tools are currently not mature,
so basically it does not matter which one you chose.

Last but not least they point out that Application Security should be
considered as responsibility of the developers, well aware that this
would be the ideal situation.
Therefore, also scanning for vulnerabilities should be done by the
developers, the security guys should only verify that the right tools
and experience is in place.

Interesting food for thought...

Regards,
Thomas

Hi,

That's interesting. I as well don't think that these tools can be used by
less skilled operators. An operator of these tools has to make sure that the
tool is configured correctly. E.g. some sites require an authentication
cookie to access data. When this cookie is not embedded in the test requests
the scanner will not come beyond the authentication check and will therefore
not see the actual site. And oh wonder: No issues are found and the site is
considered secure. That's very dangerous. In the end it means that an
operator has to know quite a lot about how web applications work and how
they are deployed.

This year I was at Blackhat Training with Dinis Cruz. During the course he
talked about static analysis of the code with tools from Once Labs and
Fortify. (Just to keep the record strait Dinis consults Once Labs to improve
their tool). He says that these tools are helpful to find possible
vulnerabilities in large volumes of code which he then exploits manually
during testing. As far as I have seen he is also practicing the mixed
testing approach and uses the tools to automate the boring parts of testing.

Kind regards
Jan P. Monsch

Hi Adrian,
I've just seen, that Jordan Wiens wrote a "Rolling Review Wrap-up" of
his webappsec scanner review:
