Hello List

I attended the Information Security Society Switzerland (ISSS) in Z?rich 
last week.

Prof. Dr. Hartmut Pohl. Prof. Pohl, CEO of softScheck gave an overview 
of their Rapid in-Depth Analysis (RiDA) Secure Development Lifecycle 
methodology.
Because I put OWASP in the registration form I got a free lunch. Who 
says there's "no such thing as a free lunch"?

I did a short review of the event. It's at:

Hi

The Swiss #days security and risk conference is just a few weeks away
(November 5/6) and offers 25 highly technical talks:
https://www.hashdays.ch/schedule.html#conference_day1

Certainly a hot topic of this year's conference is mobile security. We
have a set of expert speakers who will cover Android (Nicolas Seriot),
iPhone (Jesse Burns) as well as GSM security (Karsten Nohl/Harald
Welte). Apart from that we have a great talk from Alexander Kornbrust
on default database security and another one from Ertunga Arsal in
regard to SAP ABAP security. Last but not least, Max Moser will talk
about updated results to his research into the SuisseID.

Tickets for the conference are still available for the regular price
until October 21. Registrations are taken here:

#days also offers pre-conference technical workshops and management
sessions (November 3/4). See our homepage for details:

Best regards,
Jan for the #days organization committee
