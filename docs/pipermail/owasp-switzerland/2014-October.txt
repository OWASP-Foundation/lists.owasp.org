Hi there,

Looks like the date of the next meeting has been moved - instead of October 21st, the Wiki page now states it's Tuesday 6.11.2014. This date doesn't exist, was Tuesday 4th of November or Thursday 6th of November meant?

Cheers

Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] Date confusion for next meeting
Message-ID: <654B965F-D942-43B5-9009-7C27D56E45E5@owasp.org>

Hi everyone,
sorry for the confusion regarding the date of the next OWASP meeting. As we didn't want to interfere with the Swiss Cyber Storm conference (especially as our speaker is in the conference committee) we moved the date - unfortunately I didn't think about the fact, that we should check the new date against other security events as well. Sorry :(

To make this short:
* There won't be an OWASP Meeting on October 21th 2014
* There won't be an OWASP Meeting on November 6th 2014
* I'll check with the speaker and the location provider to find a new date that doesn't interfere  with other security events (if possible).

Expect more information regarding the next OWASP meeting very soon.

regards,
Sven

Message-ID: <215331D6-BA6C-4C03-84F1-5D26EFFD7FEC@owasp.org>

Hi everyone,
I'd like to invite you to our next OWASP Switzerland meeting on November 12th 2014. If you want to attend, please make sure to register for the event (http://doodle.com/qvmqh8txgcapewf7) as the space is *limited* to 30 attendees.

* When:
Wednesday, November 12th 2014
Starting at 18:00
Doors at 17:30

* What (presentation):
"Living on the Edge. Advanced ModSecurity to Save Your Ass" by Christian Folini
Abstract: In an ideal world, applications would be secure and developers would know what a secure flag on a cookie means. But in an ideal world, there would not be any attackers. In the real world, applications are obscure, developers do not know what a cookie is and they are generally unaware their application uses http at all. More often, there is no documentation and no surviving developer who knows an application, nobody fixes bugs, nobody has a working support contract and nobody has any interest to solve problems throughly. So ModSecurity comes in as the tool of choice to enhance, patch and secure your online application. I'll show you how. And I promise I will not bore you with SQLInjection defense.

In addition, we'll get a short tour of Open Systems Mission Control Operations by their CEO Martin Bosshardt.

* Where:
Open Systems AG
R?ffelstrasse 29
8045 Zurich
