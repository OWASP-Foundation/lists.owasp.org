Hi list members,
I'm very happy to announce the first OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter
meeting after the kickoff we had in November.

Date:
12. February 2007

Time:
18:30

Where:
Zurich Financial Services
Mythenquai 20 / Zurich

We first meet at the main reception where Tobias Christen will meet us
and bring us to the meeting room, so please try to be on time :)

Who:
Everyone is welcome, so if you know someone who could be interested in
participate, ask him/her to come too :)

What:
- - Tweakfest
Give you an overview over an event called Tweakfest which I already
posted to the mailinglist. I've some good news for you there ;)

- - Presentation by Sven Vetsch
I'll do a presentation about a webapplication security related topic if
it's possible to prepare myself for that because I've got holidays
during the next week but shouldn't be a problem because I'm looking
forward to hold one of my &quot;old&quot; presentations which is still really
interesting I think.

- - Talking about the future of our Local Chapter
On the kickoff we talked about what everyone's goal is in the OWASP
Switzerland Local Chapter and now I think it's time to discuss about how
we can reach these goals.

This is just an overview of what I think would be
needed/fun/interesting, so feel free to bring your own ideas with you
and of course during the meeting we're absolutely free to change the
&quot;program&quot; anyway.

Last but not least, special thanks to Tobias Christen for organizing the
meeting room.

Looking forward to see all of you on the 12.02 :)

Regards,
Sven
