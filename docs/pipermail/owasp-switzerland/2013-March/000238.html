<PRE>Hi everyone,
I'd like to deliver a short summary of the OWASP Switzerland Reboot meeting, that was held on March 12th 2013 in Zurich.

First of all, thanks to everyone who showed up. It was great to have &gt;10 people joining in to discuss the future of OWASP Switzerland. One if not the most important point we discussed was, that we want to go back to the bi-monthly meeting we once had. The content of the meeting on the other hand will be more flexible as we plan to not only invite speakers to give a presentation but also to have discussions about the AppSec related questions that bother us. This of course doesn't mean, that you shouldn't contact me (Sven) if you have something interesting to present to the attendees. So how will this discussion thing work? Very simple. You can find a Google spreadsheet at <A HREF="http://bit.ly/ZpR0lZ">http://bit.ly/ZpR0lZ</A> where you can fill in what topics you'd like OWASP Switzerland to choose for the meetings. For every month we will then choose one topic and have an open but (slightly) moderated discussion about it and perhaps we even find someone who can give a short presentation related to the topic to get the discussion started. Will this work? We don't know until we try but we all agreed, that it would be a waste to not use those meetings to learn as much from each other as possible. Something else we decided was, that the main audience will be security people and we're ok with it but of course, developers, managers and everybody else is highly welcome to join at any time.

Some more information about future meetings:
The meetings will take place every second month (next one on April 9th 2013) and most likely only in Zurich but we're open for Bern if enough people say so. Starting time for meetings will if nothing else is written in the announcement on this mailinglist 18:30 and after the &quot;official&quot; part, we will have dinner at a place nearby (reservation will be necessary). This also means, that we won't combine future meetings with the DEFCON Switzerland Beer on Tuesday (BoT) anymore. The reason for this is, that the overlap between the two groups was just too small in the past and it somewhat kills the possible discussions after presentations etc. when people who didn't attend the presentation walk in five minutes after it has ended.

And as a side note if you have to convince your colleagues or even yourself to join our meetings: We'll try our best to provide free beer during every meeting ;)

This were more or less the most important things we talked about and decided during the reboot meeting. If there are any questions, don't hesitate to contact me and also don't forget to put your topics/questions into the spreadsheet i mentioned (<A HREF="http://bit.ly/ZpR0lZ">http://bit.ly/ZpR0lZ</A>).

Best regards,
Sven
