Hello all

(This email is kept in english. Further mails could be in german when we
can be sure that every subscriber can understand the german language.)

Now that we are a few more I will try this again:

Please let me introduce myself. I am Adrian, working currently as
a Software Developer in Berne. Before that employment I was working as
CSO, Software Architect and as a Security Consultant. At OWASP I am one of
the
Editors for the Guide v2 and I am running this chapter.

Please everybody just drop a quick note of introduction as well. We will
then move on to find a date and place for a first chapter meeting. Ideas
and suggestions for locations and dates are welcome.

Regards,
Adrian

Hi all

First let me say that i'm glad there's a new local chapter
to be formed in Switzerland.

I'm co-founder and CEO of basis06 AG, a small software
& integration company located in Berne.

Software quality is an important issue in our daily work
and measures of application security belong to this, of course.

But nobody's perfect :-) and I'd be glad to join, share ideas,
contribute and learn.

Berne as a location for a meeting sounds good to me ;-)
But I'm flexible - also what's concerning the date.

Regards,
Reto

Hi all,

my name is Lars Rudolff. I am currently working with the In-Co GmbH located
in Leinfelden-Echterdingen (close to Stuttgart, Germany). I am responsible
for the security of our own Web Applications, which includes Application
design and Code Review. In May I will start working with the Secaron AG
located in Hallbergmoos (close to Munich, Germany). There I will be working
as a Security Consultant (Web Portals).
I already took part in the first meeting of the Germany chapter and hope to
be able to join the Switzerland Chapter as well. Since Munich is quite far
away I would prefer a location in the North (e.g. Zurich) and an Friday
afternoon/evening.

Hope to see you all soon,

Lars

Hi,

I'm Victor Fieldhouse and I work on the secure web-application environment 
of UBS in Z?rich. We've been implementing the OWASP principles for the last 
year or so, at the infrastructure level. We're also trying to get OWASP 
promoted in the developer guidelines.

I'm english but I've been here for 10 years so I have no problems with 
german or even z?rit??tsch. I'd prefer to meet in Z?rich but Bern and Basel 
are not too far away.

Bye for now,
Victor

Hi everyone, 

I am Antonio Fontes, freelancer in communication & information
management. Web-based information security is among my priority 
channels and I am convinced that a lot of risk-taking occurs during
application development processes. 

I regularly try to apply the OWASP methodology in my consultancy
projects as in my own ones (I currently work on an corporate blog
engine in Dotnet, if someone wants to see, just ask).

I am based in Geneva and I speak mainly english & french, but also 
german when it gets really compulsory ;) I guess that, as many of you
seem to be living on the german part, the meeting wouldn't happen 
near Geneva so I'd propose to meet in Bern.

See you all, soon maybe!
