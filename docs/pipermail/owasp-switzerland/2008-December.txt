Hi everyone,
our OWASP Local Chapter here in Switzerland is still alive, even if it
doesn't look like it at the moment. I really hope, to have more time for
the OWASP in 2009 but I'm also rely on your support.

Below, you'll find, what I'd like to achieve in 2009 with our local
chapter. Please let me know if you've got additional ideas or feedback:

- - Finding good speakers for all of our meetings. If you think you have
something interesting to tell/show us or know somebody who has, just let
me know.

- - More educational organizations like universities should become part of
us, because I think there are much opportunities on both sides.

- - We really should have a "regular" meeting cycle and not what we're
actually have, even if it's thought to be on a regular base.

- - Getting one or more "room sponsors" who can directly reserve rooms for
at least our four meetings in 2009. This could perhaps be something,
where the mentioned educational organizations can help us.

- - Getting some sponsors for our local chapter. We don't need companies
which spend thousands of swiss francs on the OWASP but for example if
one of us gives a speech at a conference in Switzerland on an OWASP
related topic, we should be able to support him with for example paying
the traveling costs, printing a T-Shirt or what else is needed. The
OWASP Foundation also built something like a money pool, where also our
local chapter should have access to but as more we can do on our own, as
easier it will be to organize it.


I wish all of you merry Christmas, a happy new year and hopefully a few
days of relaxing holidays :)

Regards,
Sven
