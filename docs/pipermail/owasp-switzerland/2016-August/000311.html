<PRE>Hi everyone,

I&#8217;d like to invite you to our next OWASP Switzerland meeting, taking place
on October 4, 2016. If you want to attend, please make sure to register for
the event through Meetup:
*<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/OWASPSwitzerland/events/233496754/">http://www.meetup.com/OWASPSwitzerland/events/233496754/</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/OWASPSwitzerland/events/233496754/">http://www.meetup.com/OWASPSwitzerland/events/233496754/</A>&gt;*

Space is limited.



* When:

Tuesday, October 4, 2016

Starting at 18:00

Doors at 17:30



* What: &quot;Bug Bounty programs in Switzerland?&quot; by Florian Badertscher
(Swisscom)


Talk:

For over a year now Swisscom runs its own Bug Bounty program and has chosen
to follow a different approach than many of the other well-known programs.
Learn what it takes to set up the program, keep it running in a highly
diverse environment and deal with the different needs and limitations from
a Telco, ISP and IT Services perspective. We will share insights into the
program and the real value it delivers to the company, in addition to the
vulnerabilities you learn about.


Discussion:

You are a critical thinker (who ideal (him-)herself has reported findings
to some kind of &quot;bug bounty program&quot;), a penetration tester, some coloured
hat or simply interested in this topic? Then please attend our next meeting
and bring along your questions, thoughts and own experiences with
responsible disclosure programs.

Flo is looking forward to discussions around questions like:

+ What are your concrete requirements / expectations to a bug bounty
program, what are your experiences participating in these?

+ How does your responsible disclosure program work (if there is one)?

+ What pitfalls did you step in?

+ What are your experiences with companies like Hackerone or Bugcrowd?
