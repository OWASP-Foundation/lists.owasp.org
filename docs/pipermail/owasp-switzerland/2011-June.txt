Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter Meeting 14.
	June 2011 Updates
Message-ID: <4DF4B051.8010906@owasp.org>

Hi everyone,
as you hopefully have in your agenda, in two days on the 14. June 2011
there will be an OWASP Meeting in Zurich.

The Meeting details:
Tue, June 14th at 16:00
Niederdorfstrasse 76, 8001 Z?rich
(Map: http://bit.ly/jrWRpd)

For now we have two talks:

* Pascal Buchbinder
Automatic CRL updates for the Apache Web server

* Sven Vetsch
OWASP Updates and perhaps I can also prepare some slides about one or
two actual OWASP projects.

If you spontaneously think that you can also give a short presentation,
bring your slides and you'll get a speaker slot :)

Hope to see you all on Tuesday,
Sven

Hi everyone,
even if it's quite late to announce it:

I've just received the slides from Tobias Gondrom (Chair of IETF Web
Security WG) from his talk "New Standards and upcoming Technologies in
Browser Security" which he presented at the OWASP AppSecEu in Dublin
last week. I'll present his talk today at our local chapter meeting!

See you all later,
Sven
