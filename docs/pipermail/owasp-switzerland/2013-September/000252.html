<PRE>Hi all

A few months ago we had the idea of switching locations every now and then to get closer to the people interested in OWASP. I'm helping Sven to organize locations for our OWASP chapter meetings in the Zurich area. As you can probably imagine, it's not easy to find something suitable for free. The basic idea is that we bring these free meetings and the knowledge or curiosity of the participants to various organizations (non-/commercial) and in turn get a location for a few hours. We could still use a choice of some more locations... :-) We already found something for December, but if we find something for the October meeting, that would be awesome!

==&gt;If you or your employer are interested in hosting one of our meetings and have a meeting room/area that may serve 10-30 people, please get in contact with me! &lt;==


If you need something more suitable to forward to your boss, take this:
-----------
I'm helping Swiss OWASP chapter&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Switzerland">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Switzerland</A>&gt; leader Sven Vetsch in finding locations where we can hold one of our chapter meetings. As you might know, OWASP&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP</A>&gt; is an international non-profit organization dedicated to Application Security. Our current meeting cycle runs every two months. These meetings are open to the public, no membership required. A few months ago, we came up with the idea to switch between different locations in the Zurich area, with the main target to reach (mainly) IT people from different sectors and roles. These meetings are held in various forms, sometimes it's just an open discussion, but most of the time somebody will present a topic which will then intensively be discussed among the participants. It is important to note that we are not only searching to attract IT Security professionals but also to get more software developers and other IT professionals as well as generally in security interested persons that are concerned about the security of their software. Meetings last usually for 2 hours, followed by beers in a restaurant or bar (or on site, sometimes offered by the location sponsors).

These meetings usually attract 10-25 people, depending on the topics discussed. It is pretty hard to find free locations in Zurich, but I believe that if we can spread the word that there's something to learn for free, we will be able to find a location sponsor that has colleagues, employees and friends around that want to join one of this free events. We hope that this will be a win-win situation for both the location sponsor and the participants of Swiss OWASP meetings.

In general, would you be able and willing to organize a location? If you see any possibility, I'd like to get in touch with you regarding one of the future dates when our next OWASP meetings will be (sort of flexible). Even if you don't see a possibility for one of these dates, we might keep in touch to organize a future meeting. If you know anything about other free locations in Zurich, I'd greatly appreciate your hint. Thank you very much in advance for your consideration, and hopefully to talk on the phone soon!
