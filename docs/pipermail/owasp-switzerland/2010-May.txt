Hi everyone,
thanks to everyone who participated in our survey. Now I'd like to give
you a short overview of the results and their impact:

- - Why do you participate in OWASP meetings?
Over 50% of you said, that you're most interested in Networking. This
means, that we will try to reserve some time at the meetings to get to
know each other and talk about application security and everything else
you want.

- - What kind of presentation do you want to see?
Until now, we didn't had a focus on presentation topics but according to
your wishes, we will especially (but no exclusively) look for
presentations within the following topics:
  - Security testing
  - Secure development
  - Hacking
  - Secure Architectures

- - How many meetings per year should we offer?, What would be the optimal
time to start the OWASP meetings?, Where should the meetings take place?
You voted and we try to make it possible: 4 times a year an OWASP
Meeting with 2 presentations starting around 17:00 in Zurich. Perhaps we
will also organize one of the meetings in Bern because it seems that
quiet a lot of people would like an alternating location.

- - Are you interested in having a dinner together after the meetings?
It seems that we have to reserve a big part of a restaurant next time to
get some good food :)

- - Do you have anything else you want to tell us or any feedback?
Thanks to all your valuable feedback and the support. I think that most
of the requests in the feedback match to what we want to accomplish now
according to the survey results.


Best regards,
Sven

Hi everyone,
there are some good news on OWASP Switzerland which I want to share with
you:

- - Antonio Fontes who's leading the OWASP Geneva chapter is now also a
member of the board with the function "Representative of OWASP Geneva".
This will allow us to better operate in the whole country and not only
in the German speaking part of it.

- - We have our own domain. You can now reach our OWASP wiki page over
http://owasp.ch which makes it a lot easier to remember and to tell
people about it. Thanks to Antonio for that.

- - I updated our wiki page with some additional information and I'm
looking forward to also publish presentations etc. after future meetings
there. Remember: http://owasp.ch :)

- - Tobias and me are actually planning an OWASP Meeting for the end of
June. We're quiet late for that but we're looking forward to make it
happen and to be able to inform you early enough about the presentations
and everything else.

Best regards,
Sven
