Hi list members,
in exactly one week the OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter meeting will
take place.

Here you have a short overview of the facts:

_When_
11th November 2006 from 10am to 1pm

_Where_
UBS Sport Centre Guggach
K?ferholzstrasse 40
8057 Z?rich

More infos on the UBS website:
http://www.ubs.com/1/g/conference_centers/guggach.html

Map:
http://map.search.ch/zuerich/kaeferholzstr.-40

_What_
It seems that at least the following topics will be part of the meeting;
- - Who is who?
- - What is the OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter at the moment?
- - What should the OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter be?
- - Future meetings

And of course I hope that there will be also some small talk and such stuff.

I think (and hope) it will be a very open meeting and not one of them in
which we must have a checklist for what we like to talk about :)

_Who_
You can have a look on the voting to see who at least said that he will
be able to come but the "event" is open to everyone.

Here's the link to the voting:
http://www.doodle.ch/dpusY5BC9bqi


So, now I'm looking forward to see you next Saturday and wish you a nice
weekend :)


Regards,
Sven

Hash: SHA1

Hi list members,
as you know today was the Kickoff-Meeting of the OWASP Switzerland Local
Chapter. I really think it was a good start :)

As I said at the meeting, I'll send you a list of the Firefox Extensions
I'm using for auditing webapplications and security related stuff. So
here it is:

Add & Edit Cookies - Cookies Editor:
http://addneditcookies.mozdev.org/

cookieculler:
http://cookieculler.mozdev.org/

DOM Inspector:
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/inspector/

greasemonkey:
http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/

XForms Buddy:
http://beaufour.dk/index.php?sec=misc&pagename=xforms

Web Developer Extension:
http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/

User Agent Switcher Extension:
http://chrispederick.com/work/useragentswitcher/

tamperdata:
http://tamperdata.mozdev.org/

LiveHTTPHeaders:
http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/


So, that's it :)

Of course I'm never using all these Extensions during an audit but if
you've installed these, you can do most of the known attacks on
webapplications independent what you're going to test.

If you have any question to one or more of these tools, don't hesitate
to ask :)

Have a nice weekend.

Regards,
Sven

Hi list members,
as we discussed at today's meeting I asked Adrian if he's still not able
to have the lead because of having not enough time and offering to take
over the lead myself. Adrian wrote back to me very fast and said that he
still have too much other things to do, so he can't really do his job as
a leader of this local chapter. Ha also said that for him it's ok when I
taking that job.

So, I think everything should be clear and of course if someone don't
want that I becoming the new leader I'm open to discussing about that
but in the meeting it looked like it's ok for everyone who was there :)

Wish you all a nice weekend.

Regards,
Sven

Hi list members,
we now have to decide, what comes next for the OWASP Switzerland Local
Chapter.

- ---------------------------------------------------------

1.)
First, I would like to ask everyone on the list who's still alive and
would be active in any way related to this Chapter, to send a short
introduction of his person to the list and it would also be nice if the
people who already did that, at least send a link, pointing to their
mail with the introduction in it, so that we know that they're still
here. This would be very important, because it seems to me, to be the
only way to see who's really willing to be part of the chapter and who's
only registered to the mailinglist. If you have any problems with
sharing informations about you to the whole world please send at least a
mail to me so that I know that you're interested in the Chapter. If
everyone do that I know how many active members that we have at the
moment and not only how many people are on the mailing list. On the
other hand we can see who's who even if not everyone was at the kickoff.

2.)
As we decided at the Kickoff meeting, it would be very cool if we can do
some knowledge transfer in form of presentations and/or workshops. If I
remember it right, it would be better if we can do it on a evening
during the week for most of the people which were at the kickoff. What's
the meaning of the others, when would it be ok for you to do such things
or meetings in general? As soon as I've got this information I'll set up
a voting pool with some dates.

3.)
There was also the idea to do a meeting in Berne or at least in this
region because it seems that a few people come from around there and
could be that they can't come to Zurich only for a meeting.

I've set up a voting pool at doodle which you can reach under
http://www.doodle.ch/dpSV7QTXpF4e to find out if Berne would be better
but if it's ok for most of the people, there is still the question about
a meeting place. If someone can offer a room in/around Berne please
contact me.

- ---------------------------------------------------------

FYI: I get now the admin-password and so on for managing this mailing
list, edited our the wiki page
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Switzerland) and introduced myself to
the other chapter leaders. So now I officially started my job as leader
of the OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter and if you have any questions,
ideas or something else, don't hesitate to contact me.

PS: Of course I'll send an introduction of myself too, but I'll put it
in a separate mail ;)

Regards,
Sven

Thanks Sven (and Sandro) for taking the initiative on the last meeting and 
breathing new life into the swiss chapter.

My intro is still at 
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-switzerland/2005-March/000048.html. 
This should also be a warning to others that the OWASP mail archive is online.

At the meeting I promised to provide links to a couple of security-related 
lists in the Zurich area ...

zog-security: 
<http://zog.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/zog-security>http://zog.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/zog-security

The goal of this list is to create an open forum for IT security staff and 
consultants in and around Switzerland, to meet and discuss issues relevant 
to the field.
Please feel free to share this URL with anyone working in information 
security, or simply interested in IT security-related topics.
ZISC: https://lists.inf.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/zisc-announcements
This is a moderated, low-traffic mailing list for announcements related to 
the Zurich Information Security Center (ZISC).

So, here's my introduction :)

My name is Sven Vetsch and I'm working for a security company called
Dreamlab Technologies Ltd. (http://dreamlab.net/) which you can find in
the capital city of Switzerland; in Berne. In this company I'm doing
many different things like security analyses, auditing and also
consulting services for our customers, but my main interest is in the
topic of webapplication security where I'm doing research and playing
around with all that kind of stuff for about three years now in a very
intensive way and at the same time it's also one of my hobbies.
So, now I also should answer the standard question: "Why did you join
the OWASP?" The answer is quiet simple, because for my it was important
to find some other people which are also interested in webapp security
and so I found my way to the OWASP. After that, I read the guide and
started to have a look at the projects because at least since I'm doing
professional webapplication security audits, it's very important for my
to have some tools and with tools I don't think only about the
applications like Webscarab and so on, I also learned how I can use all
the information in the guide and the other "paper stuff" for my daily
work and so the OWASP became very important to me.

So, if you have some future questions about me or the OWASP Switzerland
Local Chapter, don't hesitate to ask me or you can also visit my Blog at
www.disenchant.ch for getting some more information.

Regards,
Sven

Hello from Geneva,

My name is Christian ALT and I'm a network security consultant with Telecom
and Logistics Associates. My major activities are with firewalls and VPNs
installations. Below you'll find a link to my description:

http://www.tla.ch/TLA/TLAabout-en.htm

Additionally I do programming in Java and as such the security of web
services interest me. I'm new to owasp and I just discover that you meet
from time to time. This is great and of course if you could meet in Geneva
this would be perfect.

Bern is OK and I should be able to make it from time to time. By the way I
can also speak swiss-german.

Bye for now,

My name is Patrick Grieshaber, im living in Switzerland,
nearby Zurich and i'm working in Zug. I am a 19 years young computer
scientist, working for the Siemens Building&Technologies. Actually, at
this time i'm still in training. Some months ago i worked one year as
a system technician in a Microsoft Windows based network ? gained some
Linux experience in my spare time. Actually i'm working as an
application developer for the
Siemens HVP, contributing a 30 headed Team of engineer and developer.
The current tasks i have to complete are about using vb.net Framework
v2.0 or C++ based on Linux to create or extend already existing tools.

My knowledge and experience on operating systems is dedicated to:

*Linux/*nix
**Gentoo
**FreeBSD
**Debian
*Windows 2000/XP/2003 Server

But i must mention that Linux is absolutely my preferred operating
system. I like it because its free, secure, small, fast, comfortable and
very free configurable.
Additional i like the concept of net installation cd's and repair
possibilities like Gentoo allows it.

In my spare time, i develop websites or test new white papers and their
described techniques (eg SQL injection).

You shall find some more information about me on: http://www.m4tix.net/

Patrick

 Hello all,

 though not living in Switzerland, I am interested in the activities of the
Owasp Swiss chapter - I am living in Lyon (fr), so it is not so far away.
 I am a PhD student working about security and the OSGi platform. I have
recently begun to be active in the frame of the OWASP Java Project.
 for those who are interested in more details, you can have a look at my home
page (ok, it partly in french, but all resources are in english):
http://www.rzo.free.fr/
 Relative to meeting, I must own up that coming to Zurich for an informal
meeting is not so easy (just 8 hours of car, and not sure that my boss will pay
me a plane ticket). But if something is going on in Geneva or Lausanne, I will
be pleased to join you.

 I do not speak swiss-german very good, as you can guess. However, I have spent
sufficient time in Germany to get at least the second half of der Z?richer
Sprache.

best regards,

Pierre Parrend

Hi list members,
I've got some news for you.

As those of you which where at the kickoff might remember, Patrick told
us something about an event called Tweakfest (http://www.tweakfest.ch/)
which will taking place in Zurich from 24-26 May 2007. Patrick talked
now to the guy which is responsible for this event and it seems like
he's really interested in get some inputs from the OWASP Switzerland
Local Chapter. Because he'd like to have some basic infos as soon as
possible, we have to discuss this on the mailinglist unfortunately.
Please give your comments and also ask questions if you have some.

Because the OWASP isn't very popular at all in Switzerland yet, this
would be a great chance to promote it and of course our Local Chapter.
For doing that, I think we have at least the following possibilities:

1.) We can hold a presentation about the OWASP, it goals and also what
we're planning to do related to it in Switzerland.

2.) We can hold a technical presentation in which we show the importance
of (web)application security to the folks there and give them some hints
that there exists an OWASP which they can/should join ;)

3.) We can do a workshop, for example on how to use the OWASP tools or
the Firefox extenstions I wrote a mail about after the kickoff.

So, discussion is open for everyone. Me I'm preferring option 1. and of
course if you have an option 4. or 5. please let the others know :)

PS: For me, it should be possible to hold a presentation or doing a
workshop I think. Someone else?

Regards,
Sven

Dear Swiss OWASP members,

Following the good example of Alessandro Moretti I would like to take the 
opportunity to introduce myself to the OWASP members.

My name is Tobias Christen. After having worked in SBV&UBS in the late 
nineties in the area of architecture and security I moved for 6 years to 
Finland where I served as R&D Manager and CTO of a security software 
company (Stonesoft). Now I'm back in Switzerland, working for Zurich 
Financial Services in the area of Security Architecture and IT Risk 
Strategy. We are currently developing new standards for secure application 
development (as a chapter to the security architecture handbook).

I will be glad to support the Swiss OWASP where ever possible and look 
forward to interesting discussions and sessions.

Best regards

Hi all,


Following Alessandro Moretti (for who I am actually working:-)) - I'd
like to take the chance to write up a short intro on me as well.

I am working in UBS Investment Bank in Zurich within the IT Security
Risk Management department, more specifically I am part of the global IT
security risk assessment team. I joined UBS about two years ago after I
have been writing a diploma thesis at Novartis Pharma AG in Basel. There
I have been working within the Global IT Security department where I
wrote my thesis on "Application Level Security Management" - to finish
my study at the FH Konstanz in Germany. There I first got in touch with
OWASP and basically based my thesis on an analysis along these
vulnerabilities within web apps(on which I have focussed in the thesis)
and on possible countermeasures mapped against preventive (along the
SDLC like secure coding examples, developer education, utilisation of
source code scanners etc) and also protective security controls (web app
firewalls and host-based IPS)

Based on this I have joined UBS IB and began with doing risk
assessments, technical consulting with IT stakeholders such as
developers, architects, project managers and also have been writing a
technical standard for secure web app development within UBS IB, which
again uses OWASP as one important input source to determine appropriate
app layer security controls.

I think that's it for the moment - hopefully I will meet some of you at
one of the upcoming CH chapter meetings (if there will be some...)

Bregs,
-Mic

Hi list members,
nice to see some more activity on this ML :)

In the mail I've sent out on the Tue Nov 14 12:49 2006 [1] I linked a
voting pool at doodle.ch for the next meeting. That pool was now online
for the last two weeks what I think should be enough. And the winner of
the voting seems to be Zurich. This means that also the next meeting
will take place there. If someone of the people around Geneva, Berne or
somewhere else can offer a room we can discus again about future meetings.

In another mail I've sent to the list [2] I asked for your comments
about the so called "Tweakfest". Because we have to give them a feedback
as soon as possible and I didn't get any responses of someone I would
like to present them the ideas I wrote about in my mail and get their
opinion. Then we can talk about the details on the next meeting which
I'll announce on the list after I have some more information from the
Tweakfest guys.
