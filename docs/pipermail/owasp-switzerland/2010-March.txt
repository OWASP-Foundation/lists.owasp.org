Hi everyone,
at least for me it's sometimes quiet hard to see who really are the
people interested in the OWASP in Switzerland. This is why I created a
group at Xing where everyone who's interested can join.

http://www.xing.com/group-52491.3202da

Please: Discuss as much as possible on the mailinglist and *don't* use
Xing as a communication platform because of there are people who aren't
on Xing and perhaps also people who have accounts but don't want to join
the group.

PS: Don't forget about the voting for the next meeting date at:

Best regards,
Sven

The meeting will be located in the office of DSwiss:

It's possible, that we have to change the meeting location because we're
already quiet a lot people. If that happens, I'll inform you also over
this mailinglist.

I've already sent all other information to this list and it can be found
in the archive at:
