Hi everyone,
I hope you all had a great start into the new year. Like last year, we?re planning on having six OWASP Switzerland meetings during the year. I tried to find some good dates without interfering with other security events but before we fix them I?d like you to let me know if I missed any relevant conflicts.

The following are *not* final dates yet:
* February 18th, 2015
* April 14th, 2015
* June 17th, 2015
* August 18th, 2015
* October 14th, 2015
* December 15th, 2015

I?ll make changes to the dates based on feedback I?m receiving from you by the end of this week. Afterwards I?ll publish the final dates.

PS: As usual we?re looking for speakers and location providers :)

regards,
Sven

Hi everyone,
we have a speaker (Michele Spagnuolo, Google) for our next OWASP Switzerland Meeting. What?s still missing is a venue. So if anyone could provide a meeting space in Zurich for 20-30 people on February 18th 2015, that would be great. Please contact me if you can help out.


thanks,
Sven

Hi everyone,
I?d like to invite you to our next OWASP Switzerland meeting on February 18th 2015. If you want to attend, please make sure to register for the event with your *full name* through http://doodle.com/xa6fxpqnv7mq52hy. Space is limited to 30 attendees.


* When:
Wednesday, February 18th 2015
Starting at 18:00
Doors at 17:30


* What (presentation):
"Abusing JSONP with Rosetta Flash" by Michele Spagnuolo, Google


Abstract:
Michele will present an exploitation technique that involves crafting charset-restricted Flash SWF files in order to abuse JSONP endpoints and allow Cross Site Request Forgery attacks against domains hosting JSONP endpoints, bypassing the Same Origin Policy.


With this attack it is possible to make a victim perform arbitrary requests to the domain with the JSONP endpoint and exfiltrate potentially sensitive data, not limited to JSONP responses, to an attacker-controlled site.


High profile Google domains, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo!, eBay, Mail.ru, Flickr, Baidu, Instagram, Tumblr and Olark have had or still have vulnerable JSONP endpoints at the time of writing. Popular web development framework Ruby on Rails and MediaWiki also addressed this vulnerability.


Rosetta Flash leverages zlib, Huffman encoding and ADLER32 checksum bruteforcing to convert any SWF file to an equivalent one composed of only alphanumeric characters, so that it can be passed as a JSONP callback and then reflected by the endpoint, effectively hosting the Flash file on the vulnerable domain. We use ad-hoc Huffman encoders in order to map non-allowed bytes to allowed ones. Naturally, since we are mapping a wider charset to a more restrictive one, this is not a real compression, but an inflation: we are, in a way, using Huffman as a Rosetta stone.


Rosetta Flash has been nominated for a Pwnie Award and won an Internet Bug Bounty by HackerOne.
