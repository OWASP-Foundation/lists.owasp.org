solving application security issues in the "real world" and provide them
a venue where they can share their experiences with others.

I want to thank Tom Brennan at OWASP for putting this Member benefit
together for us.  I apologize for sending you this email before phoning
you, but I did not have your phone number.

Hi everyone,
unfortunately it's some time ago since the last OWASP Local Chapter
Meeting because I had (and still have) much things to handle at the
moment, including my holidays ;)

Anyway, I want to ask you for content for the next meeting. I already
got some inputs from different people but I'm not sure how up to date
these offers are. If you think you have something interesting to talk
about or to show, which is in any way related to application security,
please ping me and we can discuss possible dates for the meeting, which
will then become public to the others for the usual final voting.

Thanks in advance for your support :)

Regards,
Sven
