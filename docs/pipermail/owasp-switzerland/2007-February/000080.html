* Call for Papers
----------------------------------------------------------------
Making networks and systems robust must consider the need for reduced CAPEX
(fewer network elements and less space required) as well as reduced OPEX (lower
power consumption, less boxes to manage, fewer issues with software versions,
configurations, spares, etc.). At a large scale, all these aspects must be
considered in the design phase and appropriate maintenance plans must be in
place to avoid.
The International Conference on Global Defense and Business Continuity (ICGD&amp;BC
2007) initiates a series of industrial/academic events dedicated to systems
protection and business continuity. It brings into the picture resiliency,
redundancy, emergency, and disaster recovery together with the chief topics
business continuity, disaster recovery, risk analysis, trust, digital rights,
and biometrics.
Current practice for engineering carrier grade IP networks suggests n-redundancy
schema. From the operational perspective, complications are involved with
multiple n-box PoP. It is not guaranteed that this n-redundancy provides the
desired 99.999% uptime. Two complementary solutions promote (i) high
availability, which enables network-wide protection by providing fast recovery
from faults that may occur in any part of the network, and (ii) non-stop
routing. Theory on robustness stays behind the attempts for improving system
reliability with regard to emergency services and containing the damage through
disaster prevention, diagnosis and recovery.
Highly reliable emergency communications are required by public safety and
disaster relief agencies to perform recovery operations or associated with
disasters or serious network events. Future advanced network development and
evolution should take into consideration these requirements through solutions:

    * Identification of suitable technologies, i.e., narrowband and broadband
aspects,
    * Interoperability and interworking between emergency communications
capabilities and public networks,
    * Preferential access to communications resources capabilities,
applications, and facilities,
    * Preferential use of remaining operational resources.

The conference covers a large spectrum of topics related to global defense and
business continuity technologies. Topics are clustered into specialized tracks
treating about business continuity, risk assessment, privacy, digital rights
and biometrics techniques. 
The conference has the following specialized tracks:
BUSINESS: Business continuity
RISK: Risk assessment
DISASTER: Emergency services and disaster recovery
TRUST: Privacy and trust in pervasive communications   
RIGHT: Digital rights management
BIOTEC: Biometric techniques
           
We welcome technical papers presenting research and practical results, position
papers addressing the pros and cons of specific proposals, such as those being
discussed in the standard fora or in industry consortia, survey papers
addressing the key problems and solutions on any of the above topics short
papers on work in progress, and panel proposals.
The topics suggested by the conference can be discussed in term of concepts,
state of the art, standards, implementations, running experiments and
applications. Authors are invited to submit complete unpublished papers, which
are not under review in any other conference or journal in the following, but
not limited topic areas.
Industrial presentations are not subject to these constraints. We expect short
and long presentations that express industrial position and status.  
Tutorials on specific related topics and panels on challenging areas are
encouraged.  

* Technical marketing/business/positioning presentations
----------------------------------------------------------------
The conference initiates a series of business, technical marketing, and
positioning presentations on the same topics. Speakers must submit a 10-12
slide deck presentations with substantial notes accompanying the slides, in the
.ppt format (.pdf-ed). The slide deck will be published in the conference\u2019s
CD collection, together with the regular papers. Please send your presentations
to <A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-switzerland">petre at iaria.org.</A>


* Tutorials
----------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorials provide overviews of current high interest topics. Proposals can be
for half or full day tutorials. Please send your proposals to <A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-switzerland">petre at iaria.org</A>


* Panel proposals:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The organizers encourage scientists and industry leaders to organize dedicated
panels dealing with controversial and challenging topics and paradigms. Panel
moderators are asked to identify their guests and manage that their appropriate
talk supports timely reach our deadlines. Moderators must specifically submit an
official proposal, indicating their background, panelist names, their
affiliation, the topic of the panel, as well as short biographies. For more
information, <A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-switzerland">petre at iaria.org</A>


* Workshop proposals
----------------------------------------------------------------
We welcome workshop proposals on issues complementary to the topics of this
conference. Your requests should be forwarded to <A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-switzerland">petre at iaria.org</A> .
