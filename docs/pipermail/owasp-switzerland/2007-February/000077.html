Hi list members,
I'm very happy to confirm my talk at the next OWASP Switzerland Local
Chapter meeting at the 12. February 2007. During my holiday last week, I
had some time to think about what exactly I can show to you and
yesterday I had some hours left in which I did a nearly complete
revision of my presentation about XSS-Worms and this new presentation
I'm going show you on the next meeting.

I don't know if all of you already heard about XSS-Worms and because of
that, there's something for everyone I think. It starts with some basics
on cross side scripting at all and ends with countermeasures against
this kind of worms. As a little special, there's also a completely new
part, which's AFAIK never discussed since now, it's about how to use
this kind of worms from an attackers point of view, how to control it
and I'll show you why XSS-Worms are much more dangerous than most of the
&quot;experts&quot; think.

Regards,
Sven
