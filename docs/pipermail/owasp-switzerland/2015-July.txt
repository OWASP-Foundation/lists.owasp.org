Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] Next OWASP Meeting (Speaker and Location!?)
Message-ID: <1438169152765.2b3aa69e@Nodemailer>

Hi everyone
Once again we?re having no speaker and no location for the next OWASP meeting which is planned to take place on August 19th 2015. If you can provide either of those two things, please get in touch with me as soon as possible. If we don?t get those two things, we?ll have to cancel the August meeting :(


thank you for your support,
Sven
