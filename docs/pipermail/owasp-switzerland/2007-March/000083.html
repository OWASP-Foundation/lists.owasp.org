Hi everyone,
following you'll find the (hopefully) final information about the
already announced next OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter Meeting and a
&quot;Swiss Security Dinner&quot; afterwards.

Date and time:
26. April 2007
Meeting 17:00-19:00
Dinner 19:00-??:??

There was a voting pool to find the date which's best for most of the
interested people. The voting's finished now to find the date but if you
would like to attend to the meeting and the dinner, please also give
your vote to the 26. April 2007 because of the reservation in the
restaurant. The voting pool will be closed on the 16. April 2007 and if
you decide to come later then this date, please send me a mail directly.

Here's the voting pool:

Where (Meeting):
Zurich Financial Services
Mythenquai 2 / Zurich

<A HREF="http://map.search.ch/zuerich/mythenquai-2">http://map.search.ch/zuerich/mythenquai-2</A>


Where (Dinner):
This is not fixed yet because it's still able to register through the
voting pool but I think it would be an Italian Restaurant because there
everyone should find something he/she likes.


Who:
As at all of our meetings, everyone is welcome, so if you know someone
who could also be interested in participate, ask him/her to come too :)


What (Meeting):
There will be a presentation about risk metrics by Dr. Brian Chess
which's the CTO and founder of Fortify Software (<A HREF="http://fortify.com/">http://fortify.com/</A>).
I'm really looking forward to his talk because I already had a look on
his presentation slides and it's interesting stuff. Before and after the
presentation there would be some smalltalk or discussions I think and
especially after, we can also go somewhere to have an appetizer before
the dinner.


Remember that it's important, that *anyone* who would like to come votes
on the voting pool because we should know how many people attending to
the meeting and especially the dinner for do the reservation.

If there are any further questions, don't hesitate to ask :)

Regards,
Sven
