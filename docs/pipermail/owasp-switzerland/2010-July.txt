Subject: [Owasp-switzerland] #days extended CFP deadline and workshop
	announcements
Message-ID: <AANLkTilz5-GXb7bpeKam6ZDZ4PB5UG7MirSGraCZ___2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

#days the Swiss conference for security, extends its call for
papers (CfP) deadline until July 25th 2010. For details regarding the
submission guidelines see:
https://www.hashdays.ch/call-for-papers.html

Furthermore, we herewith proudly announce our #days workshops:
1) "Protecting from GSM attacks with Harald Welte, Karsten Nohl and
David Burgess:
This two-day workshop revisits the basics of GSM, SS7, and OTA before
discussing their control and trust mechanics. It will become apparent
that technology providers and attackers can invade GSM users' location
and communication privacy in multiple ways. The workshop is targeted
at GSM users concerned with the confidentiality of their information
and location. The class provides technical and organizational
protection strategies for minimizing the attack surface and mitigating
the risks of the telecommunication infrastructure.

2) Exploit Laboratory with Saumil Shah:
The workshop brings you an action packed class teaching the art of
exploitation from scratch. We start with an insight into system
architecture, process execution, operating systems and error
conditions. We then accelerate to using debuggers, reproducing
reliable error conditions and exploit writing. Most of the class time
is spent working on exercises that cover both the Linux and Windows,
illustrating stack overflows, heap overflows and memory overwrites.
The class is delivered in a down-to-earth, learn-by-example
methodology.

The early bird for both workshops lasts until July 25th, 2010. For
details and registration see:

Best regards,
The #days organization committee
