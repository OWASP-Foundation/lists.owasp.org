Subject: [Owasp-switzerland] Chapter Lead Wanted
Message-ID: <20060828225034.2d776ae5@localhost.localdomain>

Hello all

To revitalise this chapter I am looking for a Chapter Lead who is
interested (and willing) to take over the lead for the OWASP Switzerland
Chapter.

What does this mean to be chapter lead? You would be required to organise
some meetings where other chapter members could have a beer and talk with
each other. You could organise speeches and demos (or coordinate others
doing so) and do whatever is good to keep the chapter running and healthy.

Please also see this link for further details:

<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Rules>

I would very much welcome if somebody would step up and take over the
chapter lead for I think the whole topic of web application security in
Switzerland could need some fresh air and a few good events for the
specialists.

If you are interested or know somebody who could be, please drop me a
note.

Regards,
Adrian

Message-ID: <44DB4A37.8060603@owasp.org>

Attention OWASP Community,

OWASP is moving all of our mailing lists off of SourceForge and onto our
own infrastructure. We?re making this move to allow for better control
over the mail infrastructure and to address some service problems we?ve
been experiencing. Your account will be moved automatically, and you
don?t need to take any action. However, you may want to set your spam
filter to allow messages from the new lists. All OWASP email lists will
come from @lists.owasp.org. All OWASP lists can be found at
http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo

Thank you for your continued support of OWASP.

--OWASP
