Subject: [Owasp-switzerland] Chapter Survey - Results
Message-ID: <47AF2A3E.20805@disenchant.ch>

Hi everyone,
I've finally got the results of the chapter survey for last year (2007), 
you'll find them in the attached PDF document.

A few words about the results:
As you can see in the PDF, the meeting cycle seems to be perfect as it 
is for most people and also the content is what the attendees want to 
have. For Question 6, which was "What would you recommend to make our 
chapter meetings more interesting for you?", the answer was mostly that 
we should do more workshops and/or hands-on stuff. I really like this 
idea and I'll try to organize more of them for future meetings.

Special thanks to everyone who participated in the survey :)

Regards,
Sven
