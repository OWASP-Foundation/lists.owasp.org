Hi everyone,
I just would like to point out, that we already have 24 attendees registered for the meeting on February 19th 2014. This is great but also means, that only 4 seats remain. If you'd like to join the meeting you shouldn't wait any longer to reserve your seat (http://doodle.com/aa8822cp5qfkpu3z).

Regards,
Sven

> Many companies have it (somehow) and numerous are planning to implement one ? a Secure Software Development Life Cycle (S-SDLC). As Swisscom is building a new Cloud, the whole S-SDLC had to be reconsidered to match the new challenges. In this presentation I would like to give you an overview of the four fundamental phases that we plan to implement in our new S-SDLC (Intellectual Property Scan, Code Review, Vulnerability Scanning and Stress & Volume Testing) as well as an idea of what these phases are meant to do. Additionally, I would like to give you an idea of what possible candidates (i.e. tools) could be of interest for you and where we see the biggest pitfalls so far. As this is a considerable topic, I hope that you bring with you many questions, answers as well as your own experiences to share with each other.
