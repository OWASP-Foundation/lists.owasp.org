<PRE>Hi folks!
We offer you the opportunity to enjoy and benefit from the upcoming Google Research Talk in the field of Web Security.


It is MANDATORY to register for the event via Googles official registration form: <A HREF="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsz_d6Hsq8tDFlWuyK8I2ZYlavN7B62eU1dccZ1cgg0EATnQ/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsz_d6Hsq8tDFlWuyK8I2ZYlavN7B62eU1dccZ1cgg0EATnQ/viewform</A>


Cross-Site Scripting is a constant problem of the Web platform. Over the years many techniques have been introduced to prevent or mitigate XSS. Most of these techniques, thereby, focus on script tags and event handlers. HTML sanitizers, for example, aim at removing potentially dangerous tags and attributes. Another example is the Content Security Policy, which forbids inline event handlers and aims at white listing of legitimate scripts.

In this talk, we present a novel Web hacking technique that enables an attacker to circumvent most XSS mitigations. In order to do so, the attacker abuses so-called script gadgets. A script gadget Is a legitimate piece of JavaScript in a page that reads elements from the DOM via selectors and processes them in a way that results in script execution. To abuse a script gadget, the attacker injects a benign looking element into the page that matches the gadget's selector. Subsequently, the gadget selects the benign-looking element and executes attacker-controlled scripts. As the initially injected element is benign it passes HTML sanitizers and security policies. The XSS only surfaces when the gadget mistakenly elevates the privileges of the element.

In this talk, we will demonstrate that these gadgets are present in almost all modern JavaScript libraries, APIs and applications. We will present several case studies and real-world examples that demonstrate that many mitigation techniques are not suited for modern applications. As a result, we argue that the Web should start focusing more on preventive mechanisms instead of mitigations.

Speaker:
Sebastian Lekies is a senior software engineer and a web security researcher at Google. He is specializing in client-side web application security and automated web application security testing. At Google, Sebastian is a Tech Lead of the web security scanning and the security inventory teams. Before joining Google, Sebastian was part of SAP&#8217;s Security Research team, where he conducted academic research in the area of client-side Web application security. He is regularly speaking at academic and non-academic security conferences such as BlackHat US/EU/Asia, OWASP AppSec EU, DeepSec, Usenix Security, CCS, and many more.

Agenda:
17:30 - Doors will open
18:00 - Start

Who:
As usual, all our meetings are open to everyone and free of charge.

Afterwards:
Food and drinks will be provided before and after the talk.
