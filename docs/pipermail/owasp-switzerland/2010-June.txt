Hi everyone,
unfortunately, we couldn't arrange a meeting before the summer holidays.
Anyway, we would like to define the date for our next OWASP Meeting in
Zurich which will take place at the end of August or the beginning of
September. Please vote here for your favorite Dates:

We will have at least two speakers:
- - Luke O'Connor who will talk about something in the area of "Managing
risks versus care for security baselines".
- - I (Sven) will present the results of my bachelor thesis, where I
developed a web attack honeypot.

More information about the presentations etc. will follow.

Best regards and enjoy the sun,
Sven
