>> "Living on the Edge. Advanced ModSecurity to Save Your Ass" by Christian Folini
>> Abstract: In an ideal world, applications would be secure and developers would know what a secure flag on a cookie means. But in an ideal world, there would not be any attackers. In the real world, applications are obscure, developers do not know what a cookie is and they are generally unaware their application uses http at all. More often, there is no documentation and no surviving developer who knows an application, nobody fixes bugs, nobody has a working support contract and nobody has any interest to solve problems throughly. So ModSecurity comes in as the tool of choice to enhance, patch and secure your online application. I'll show you how. And I promise I will not bore you with SQLInjection defense.

Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] Links to presentation, summary,
	more stuff and a good joke
Message-ID: <20141123132834.GA5311@elias>

Hi there,

Thanks again for attending my ModSecurity presentation in such big
numbers in Zurich the other day. I really liked the discussion after the
talk: It makes a lot of sense before you commit yourself to a tool like
ModSec. Bloody useful but one hell of a steep learning curve and a lot
of pain when maintaining your ruleset.

There are a few resources, I would like to share with you:
 - A summary of the presentation and the discussion:
   http://www.netnea.com/cms/2014/11/18/summary-of-modsecurity-talk-owasp-ch/
 - The presentation itself:
   http://www.christian-folini.ch/pub/owasp-ch-folini-nov-2014.pdf
 - The modsec-positive-stats.rb script:
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apache-Labor/labor/master/labor-06/modsec-positive-stats.rb

The script is quite easy to use. You pipe a file full of Anomaly Scores
into the script.  Each line is a request. Incoming and Outgoing score
are separated by a semicolon.

I have written two additional blogposts since our talk. You can reach them
via my website at http://www.christian-folini.ch. 

One is about an admin.ch sponsored convention about cyber risks in Berne
this week. Eweline Widmer-Schlumpf opened the conference and explained
upcoming cyber risks as follows:
Fridges can now order milk for you. That's usually seen as convenient. 
The problem starts when the milk orders a fridge for you.

Best regards!

Message-ID: <41F43EDF-01C3-42AD-B19D-4D6A752DA3C7@owasp.org>

Hi everyone,
as those of you who joined our last OWASP Meeting already know, the December meeting will be a bit special. There won?t be any big presentations but we?ll meet somewhere in Zurich to have a cheese fondue and talk about what happened in 2014 appsec wise. The fondue dinner will take place on December 10th, 2014 and a reservation till December 3rd, 2014 EOD is *mandatory*. You can register at http://doodle.com/ump72ns8kev85zhk and I hope many of you find the time to have a fun and relaxed dinner to close the year. The exact time and place will be communicated on the mailinglist as soon as I?ve made the reservation after the registration has been closed.

The dinner is as every OWASP meeting open to everyone and free of charge. Food and drinks will be paid by everyone individually.

regards,
Sven
