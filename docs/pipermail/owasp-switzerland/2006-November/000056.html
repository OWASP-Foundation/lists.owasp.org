Hi list members,
we now have to decide, what comes next for the OWASP Switzerland Local
Chapter.

- ---------------------------------------------------------

1.)
First, I would like to ask everyone on the list who's still alive and
would be active in any way related to this Chapter, to send a short
introduction of his person to the list and it would also be nice if the
people who already did that, at least send a link, pointing to their
mail with the introduction in it, so that we know that they're still
here. This would be very important, because it seems to me, to be the
only way to see who's really willing to be part of the chapter and who's
only registered to the mailinglist. If you have any problems with
sharing informations about you to the whole world please send at least a
mail to me so that I know that you're interested in the Chapter. If
everyone do that I know how many active members that we have at the
moment and not only how many people are on the mailing list. On the
other hand we can see who's who even if not everyone was at the kickoff.

2.)
As we decided at the Kickoff meeting, it would be very cool if we can do
some knowledge transfer in form of presentations and/or workshops. If I
remember it right, it would be better if we can do it on a evening
during the week for most of the people which were at the kickoff. What's
the meaning of the others, when would it be ok for you to do such things
or meetings in general? As soon as I've got this information I'll set up
a voting pool with some dates.

3.)
There was also the idea to do a meeting in Berne or at least in this
region because it seems that a few people come from around there and
could be that they can't come to Zurich only for a meeting.

I've set up a voting pool at doodle which you can reach under
<A HREF="http://www.doodle.ch/dpSV7QTXpF4e">http://www.doodle.ch/dpSV7QTXpF4e</A> to find out if Berne would be better
but if it's ok for most of the people, there is still the question about
a meeting place. If someone can offer a room in/around Berne please
contact me.

- ---------------------------------------------------------

FYI: I get now the admin-password and so on for managing this mailing
list, edited our the wiki page
(<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Switzerland">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Switzerland</A>) and introduced myself to
the other chapter leaders. So now I officially started my job as leader
of the OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter and if you have any questions,
ideas or something else, don't hesitate to contact me.

PS: Of course I'll send an introduction of myself too, but I'll put it
in a separate mail ;)

Regards,
Sven
