Hi list members,
as we discussed at today's meeting I asked Adrian if he's still not able
to have the lead because of having not enough time and offering to take
over the lead myself. Adrian wrote back to me very fast and said that he
still have too much other things to do, so he can't really do his job as
a leader of this local chapter. Ha also said that for him it's ok when I
taking that job.

So, I think everything should be clear and of course if someone don't
want that I becoming the new leader I'm open to discussing about that
but in the meeting it looked like it's ok for everyone who was there :)

Wish you all a nice weekend.

Regards,
Sven
