<PRE>Hi all,


Following Alessandro Moretti (for who I am actually working:-)) - I'd
like to take the chance to write up a short intro on me as well.

I am working in UBS Investment Bank in Zurich within the IT Security
Risk Management department, more specifically I am part of the global IT
security risk assessment team. I joined UBS about two years ago after I
have been writing a diploma thesis at Novartis Pharma AG in Basel. There
I have been working within the Global IT Security department where I
wrote my thesis on &quot;Application Level Security Management&quot; - to finish
my study at the FH Konstanz in Germany. There I first got in touch with
OWASP and basically based my thesis on an analysis along these
vulnerabilities within web apps(on which I have focussed in the thesis)
and on possible countermeasures mapped against preventive (along the
SDLC like secure coding examples, developer education, utilisation of
source code scanners etc) and also protective security controls (web app
firewalls and host-based IPS)

Based on this I have joined UBS IB and began with doing risk
assessments, technical consulting with IT stakeholders such as
developers, architects, project managers and also have been writing a
technical standard for secure web app development within UBS IB, which
again uses OWASP as one important input source to determine appropriate
app layer security controls.

I think that's it for the moment - hopefully I will meet some of you at
one of the upcoming CH chapter meetings (if there will be some...)

Bregs,
-Mic
