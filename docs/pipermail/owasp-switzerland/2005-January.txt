Hello all

(This email is kept in english. Further mails could be in german when we
can be sure that every subscriber can understand the german language.)

Please let me introduce myself. I am Adrian Wiesmann, working currently as
a Software Developer in Berne. Before that employment I was working as
CSO, Software Architect and as a Security Consultant. At OWASP I am the
Editor for the Guide v2 and I am running this chapter.

Please everybody just drop a quick note of introduction as well. We will
then move on to find a date and place for a first chapter meeting. Ideas
and suggestions for locations and dates are welcome.

Regards,
Adrian

Have a nice weekend,

Dear Colleague,

OWASP is proud to announce its second Application Security Conference to
be held April 9-10 near London. The OWASP AppSec Europe 2005 Conference is
just a short 3 months away and since there's limited seating, be sure to
register early to reserve your seat and support the not-for-profit OWASP
Foundation. Check out the OWASP website at
http://www.owasp.org/conferences.html for all the emerging details.

You'll hear great speakers like:

 - Denis Verdon (Head of CISG, Fidelity National Financial)
 - Dr. Charles Pfleeger (Author of Security in Computing)
 - Jeff Williams (OWASP Chair and CEO, Aspect Security)
 - Dinis Cruz (Leader of the OWASP .NET project)
 - Rogan Dawes (Author of WebScarab)
 - Ivan Ristic (Author of ModSecurity)
 - David Raphael (Java and .NET Security)
 - Arian Evans (Session Management and Testing Tools)

AppSec Europe 2005 is April 9-10 at Royal Holloway, University of London
--
home of one of the best InfoSec programs in Europe and featured in the Da
Vinci Code. OWASP's AppSec conferences are dedicated to real-world
application security issues and solutions. You'll learn all aspects of
application security, including people, process, and technology
perspectives.

You'll hear presentations on topics like:

  - OWASP Status, Direction, and new Projects
  - Web Application Testing Tools and Techniques
  - Code Reviews
  - Application Security in Large Organizations
  - .NET, Java, and LAMP Security
  - Web Application Intrusion Detection
  - Software Security Metrics
  - Lessons Learned in the Trenches

There will also be panel discussions on the important issues led by
corporate application security practitioners. We will post a full agenda
as soon as it is finalized. By participating you'll have a direct
opportunity to help shape and influence the direction of OWASP in 2005.

REGISTRATION DETAILS: As a not-for-profit we have been able to keep the
cost to ?150 (or $280) per seat which is significantly less than what most
conferences cost.

You can register for the conference using PayPal (preferred) using the
following email address conference-nyc at owasp.org.  We also have a direct
link to Paypal via the OWASP Website at www.owasp.org.  Alternatively, you
can register by sending a check in USD made payable to the OWASP
