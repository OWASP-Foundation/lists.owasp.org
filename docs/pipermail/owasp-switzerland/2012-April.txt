Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] *NO* OWASP Meeting today
Message-ID: <4F840824.2090902@owasp.org>

Hi everyone,
just to make sure nobody travels to Zurich to attend an OWASP meeting
today: *Today's OWASP Switzerland Meeting has to be canceled*

The reason for this is, that I just had too much things to do during the
last weeks especially because my job change.

Anyway, there's still the DEFCON Beer on Tuesday (BoT) starting 18:30.
Hope to see all of you there.

Best regards,
Sven
