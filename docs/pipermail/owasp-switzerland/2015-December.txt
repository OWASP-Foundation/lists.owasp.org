"Top X OAuth 2 Hacks" by Antonio Sanso (Adobe):


The Web Authorization (OAuth) protocol allows a user to grant a third-party Web site or application access to the user's protected resources, without necessarily revealing their long-term credentials, or even their identity.


As the web grows, more and more sites rely on distributed services and cloud computing or a third-party application utilizing APIs from multiple services.
OAuth 2 is widely used from major internet players (as Google, Facebook, Twitter) in order to secure their (also REST) APIs.


This talk will introduce the OAuth 2 framework and it will show security pitfalls and common implementation mistakes.

Hi everyone
Good news! I?ve just been informed that we can make up to 20 more seats available for next week?s OWASP Switzerland meeting (http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-switzerland/2015-December/000304.html). So if you would like to join but haven?t yet registered yourself at http://doodle.com/poll/r6hsx7bgmy9vun59 please do it now.

Also, please find below the Abstract for Pascal Buchbinder?s presentation "Reliable log data transfer: about syslog, logstash and log data signing?:  
Collecting and processing log data has never been so easy as it is today. However, there are still some implementation details to consider in order to ensure that you don't lose any data. Choosing the wrong approach might cause loss of data just in the moment when you need the data most. This short field report shows you the implementation using either rsyslog or logstash for the transport and also shows how log message signatures ensure that detect if anything get lost.

See you all next week,  
Sven
