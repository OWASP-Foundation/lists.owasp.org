There won?t be any big presentations but we?ll meet somewhere in Zurich to have a cheese fondue and talk about what happened in 2014 appsec wise. The fondue dinner will take place on December 10th, 2014 and a reservation till December 3rd, 2014 EOD is *mandatory*. You can register at http://doodle.com/ump72ns8kev85zhk and I hope many of you find the time to have a fun and relaxed dinner to close the year. The exact time and place will be communicated on the mailinglist as soon as I?ve made the reservation after the registration has been closed.
