Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] OWASP Switzerland Reboot
Message-ID: <AE8F7EF8-0843-4153-BCD3-5AB436F41347@owasp.org>

Hi everyone,
I guess I don't have to explain to anyone, that OWASP Switzerland is at the moment not what it should be. According to the OWASP Foundation Chapter Rules, we would even be considered an inactive chapter. At the moment it's mainly me (not) organizing the OWASP meetings in Switzerland which also includes reserving a location, find speakers and so on. Especially as I founded Redguard AG in 2012 I wasn't able to put the needed effort into our local chapter. So we can either let our chapter die *or* we do a reboot - the second option is definitely my favorite.

It would be great to have a meeting with the people who will be able to spend some of their time to support OWASP Switzerland (there are also small tasks). If you want to become an active part of the chapter, please fill in the following Doodle with your availability for such a meeting:

Thanks to everyone for your support and I really hope this time we can get the (O)WASP to fly in Switzerland.

Best regards,
Sven
