Subject: [OWASP-Switzerland] Static source code analysis tools: any feedback
 from the field you would like to share?
Message-ID: <4E4FD885.4010409@owasp.org>



Hi,

I am looking for feedback experience "from the field" regarding the use
of static source code analysis tools in a security context, whether
applied to web applications or not.

Any insights, advice, best or worse practices you would like to share
with the OWASP list are welcomed.

(For those willing to remain anonymous -> just send me a private reply
and I will reforward your message to the list with the sender
information stripped from the message)

Regards,
Antonio
