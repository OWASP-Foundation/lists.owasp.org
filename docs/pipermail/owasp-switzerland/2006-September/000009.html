<PRE>Hello all

Good to see that this mailing list gets some attention lately. Please let
me add a few thoughts and some administrative notes to the general
discussion:

I suggest to get things started on an easy pace. A chapter needs much
work. Not only to get it started but also to keep the momentum once things
begin to roll. So start slowly and keep your energy (and enthusiasm) and
don't loose your breath right at the beginning. Which in other words means
that I propose to start with a meeting where everybody learns to know the
others, where we can drink a beer (or two) and have a chat. Element of
such a meeting could be to formulate ideas and plans on how to proceed
afterwards: how often to meet (2-5 times / year, probably during IEX and
other expos), where to meet (changing cities), who will organise the next
meeting and what to do during the next meetings (workshops, talks,
drinkies, etc).

About the topic &quot;member or not member of OWASP&quot;: Don't overrate the thing
called &quot;membership&quot;. When I started with OWASP it was more important to
contribute than to pay a fee (actually there was none :) ). Things changed
since I stopped my work as editor for the Guide. But I guess it is still
valid to say that an Open Source project like OWASP needs every fine
contributor it can get. So no stress concerning the membership. (It's an
other story when talking about companies leeching all the stuff created by
the project without giving anything back, of course.)

And then some administrative concern: Please don't start the habit of
replying to everybody and to the list as well. If you answer a mail to the
mailinglist, everybody on the list will get a copy. There is no need to
send an additional copy to some of the list members. Such an additional
recepient will get two copies which is annoying for the recepient and
completely silly.

Regards,
Adrian
