Good morning everyone,

&gt;<i> Which in other words means that I propose to start with a meeting here
</I>&gt;<i> everybody learns to know the others, where we can drink a beer (or
</I>&gt;<i> two) and have a chat. Element of such a meeting could be to formulate
</I>&gt;<i> ideas and plans on how to proceed afterwards: how often to meet (2-5
</I>&gt;<i> times / year, probably during IEX and other expos), where to meet
</I>&gt;<i> (changing cities), who will organise the next meeting and what to do
</I>&gt;<i> during the next meetings (workshops, talks, drinkies, etc).
</I>
Yes, sounds also nice and it maybe better to focus on the future of the
chapter and do some discussions than to start with talks and things like
that (of course it would be fine to do such next time).

So I think it would be fine if you Sandro could give some concrete dates
out when it would be possible to get the room you wrote. After this the
list members which are interested in a meeting can say which date would
be ok for them. From my point of view a saturday is predestinated for
that because most people don't work then an should have time especially
when the date is definite early enough.


Regards,
Sven
