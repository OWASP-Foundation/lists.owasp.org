Hi everybody,
the OWASP leaders try to launch the second global OWASP Day on the 1.
April 2008 -> "WebAppSec Is No Joke"

I think if it's possible, we should participate in this OWASP Day and
try to get some (media) attendance for OWASP and also for our Local
Chapter here in Switzerland. My idea would be, to have a normal meeting
but with more attendees and the talks should be more of a global view on
the topic of WebAppSec (Technical, Business, Legal, ...).

Because I've got many other things to do like all of you, I'll need some
help. For this time it would be a great, if you can inform me, if you've
got any good media contacts who would like to get an interview or print
an article, contacts to universities which can inform their students in
a mass mail or offer a big room (University of Zurich or ETH?). Also any
company is welcome which could be interested in this in any way.

We should also have some interesting talks there, so that it's worth to
come. Some of you already informed me, that you would like to give a
presentation during a meeting in the near future, so what's about an
OWASP Day talk? Just inform me, what you'd like to talk about and we'll
try to bring it into the OWASP Day in Switzerland.

Thanks in advance for your help :)

Sven

Hi again everyone,
just as a small additional information: The OWASP "Day" is now known as
the OWASP "Week" because it's not possible for every participating Local
Chapter to meet on the 1.April. This means, that we can also change the
date to another one in the same week, which gives us much more flexibility.

Regards,
Sven

Hi everyone,
I just wanted to let you all know, that the 1. April 2008 is now finally
fixed to be our OWASP Day in Switzerland, during the global OWASP Week
2008. We have got a room at the ETH Zurich and the meeting will be in
the evening, so that many people should be able to attend.

We'll have different interesting talks on WebAppSec as on our normal
meetings and I really hope, to see all of you there and that you do some
advertising for the event, even if you don't have that much information
yet. I'll send more information to the list as soon as I've got them.

Regards,
Sven
