* Call for Papers
----------------------------------------------------------------

The SECURWARE 2007 (International Conference on Emerging Security Information
Systems and Technologies) is an event covering related topics on theory and
practice on security, cryptography, secure protocols, trust, privacy,
confidentiality, vulnerability, intrusion detection and other areas related to
low enforcement, security data mining, malware models, etc.

Security, defined for ensuring protected communication among terminals and user
applications across public and private networks, is the core for guaranteeing
confidentiality, privacy, and data protection. Security affects business and
individuals, raises the business risk, and requires a corporate and individual
culture. In the open business space offered by Internet, it is a need to
improve defences against hackers, disgruntled employees, and commercial rivals.
There is a required balance between the effort and resources spent on security
versus security achievements. Some vulnerability can be addressed using the
rule of 80:20, meaning 80% of the vulnerabilities can be addressed for 20% of
the costs. Other technical aspects are related to the communication speed
versus complex and time consuming cryptography/security mechanisms and
protocols.

As a multi-track event, SECURWARE 2007 will serve as a forum for researchers
from the academia and the industry, professionals, standard developers, policy
makers and practitioners to exchange ideas. The topics could be on techniques
and applications, best practices, awareness and experiences as well as future
trends and needs (both in research and practices) related to all aspects of
information security, security systems and technologies.
 
We welcome technical papers presenting research and practical results, position
papers addressing the pros and cons of specific proposals, such as those being
discussed in the standard fora or in industry consortia, survey papers
addressing the key problems and solutions on any of the above topics short
papers on work in progress, and panel proposals.

The topics suggested by the conference can be discussed in term of concepts,
state of the art, standards, implementations, running experiments and
applications. Authors are invited to submit complete unpublished papers, which
are not under review in any other conference or journal in the following, but
not limited topic areas. Industrial presentations are not subject to these
constraints. Tutorials on specific related topics and panels on challenging
areas are encouraged.  

* Technical marketing/business/positioning presentations
----------------------------------------------------------------
The conference initiates a series of business, technical marketing, and
positioning presentations on the same topics. Speakers must submit a 10-12
slide deck presentations with substantial notes accompanying the slides, in the
.ppt format (.pdf-ed). The slide deck will be published in the conference's CD
collection, together with the regular papers. Please send your presentations to
petre at iaria.org and lourdes at disca.upv.es.

* Tutorials
----------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorials provide overviews of current high interest topics. Proposals can be
for half or full day tutorials. Please send your proposals to petre at iaria.org
and lourdes at disca.upv.es.

* Panel proposals
----------------------------------------------------------------
The organizers encourage scientists and industry leaders to organize dedicated
panels dealing with controversial and challenging topics and paradigms. Panel
moderators are asked to identify their guests and manage that their appropriate
talk supports timely reach our deadlines. Moderators must specifically submit an
official proposal, indicating their background, panelist names, their
affiliation, the topic of the panel, as well as short biographies. Contact
petre at iaria.org and lourdes at disca.upv.es.

* Workshop proposals 
----------------------------------------------------------------
We welcome workshop proposals on issues complementary to the topics of this
conference. Your requests should be forwarded to petre at iaria.org and
lourdes at disca.upv.es

Hi list members,
hope you remember my last mail with the final information about the next
OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter Meeting and the dinner afterwards. If
you don't know what I'm talking about just have a look at our OWASP
mailinglist archive:
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-switzerland/2007-March/000083.html

Now the voting pool is officially "closed" and I'm very happy, that 16
people have registered for the event.

If someone like to come but isn't registered yet, please get in direct
contact with me through e-mail.

Just as a small information for the attending people:
As you see in my last mail, the meeting starts at 17:00 and because of
you can't just walk into the building of the Zurich Financial Services
and go to the meeting room, *please* wait at the reception until someone
(in all probability Tobias Christen) will pick you up there and because
of this, please try to be on time.

If you've got any problems or questions, don't hesitate to call me on my
mobile: +41 (0)79 466 37 08
(I'm speaking (Swiss-)German and my English should also be good enough
to help you :P)

Regards and have a good week,
Sven

Hi everyone,
for those of you who weren't at the OWASP Switzerland Local Chapter
meeting on the 26. April 2007 and also as a review for the guys who
where there, here's a small summary:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

- - It was the third OWASP Meeting we had here in Switzerland and it was
the first time that we sent out the invitation also to others than the
people on our mailinglist. We where about 20 people at the meeting and
from my point of view this is a great success because after the
Kickoff-Meeting in November 2006 my goal was to have at least 20 people
at the meetings and of course I don't know how many of these people will
now come to every meeting in the future but it shows me, that it's not
that hard to get these 20 people and so I also think that after the
speeches at the Tweakfest and some more invitations our local chapter
really starting to be an event which's worth to join.

- - Once more I gave some new information about the Tweakfest:
We'll give there two speeches, the first one's about OWASP at all so
this will be an overview what it is and so on and this speech will be
done by myself. The second speech is more some kind of show because
Hans-Peter Waldegger and Pascal Buchbinder from United Security
Providers will talk about the OWASP Top 10 and they'll also show what
these vulnerabilities are about and how to prevent them in form of a
live demonstration. I'm really looking forward to the Tweakfest as it is
the first event where we try to show the OWASP to a bigger group of
people here in Switzerland.

- - The highlight of this meeting was of course the talk by Brian Chess
who's the CTO and co-founder of Fortify Software. He talked about risk
metrics, which I think is one of the most important topic in the
security field at all because it's the connection between technical
people like the security pentesters and the management. From my point of
view it was a great talk and as far as I know everyone else enjoyed it too.

- - After this official part, we went to an Italian restaurant nearby the
meeting location and had there some beers as an appetizer and after
that, we get a very good dinner. I really think this was an important
part for all of the attending people because we where able to do some
networking and also just to have a nice talk with people who working
also in the security field or who are very interested in this topic.

Last but not least, special thanks goes to Fortify Software for
sponsoring the dinner and the talk by Brian Chess and of course also to
the Zurich Financial Services for offering the great location.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------


Other information:

In the future I'll not cross posting all the information mails also to
the zog.net mailinglist, I'll only send the invitation for the meeting,
so if you want to stay informed about what's going on in the OWASP
Switzerland Local Chapter, please join our mailinglist:
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-switzerland
(don't worry, it's not a high traffic ML ;) )

Now I'm looking forward to the Appsec Conference in Milano and hope that
I'll see some of you there or at least see you at the next OWASP Meeting
here in Switzerland.

Wish you all a nice weekend and stay secure :)

Regards,
Sven
