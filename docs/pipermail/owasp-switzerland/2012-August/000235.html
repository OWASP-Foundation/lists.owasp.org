<PRE>Hi everyone,
as we had (again) the problem of not having any volunteers to give a talk at our OWASP Switzerland Meeting that was planned for 14th August 2012, we have to cancel it :(

I'm very sorry about that but we really *need your help*. Of course you will alway be allowed to just participate in the meetings as an attendee but we would love to have some more people providing a talk. We don't need highly sophisticated, latest research talks. If you want to talk about how your company implemented an SDL - you got yourself a slot. If you want to talk about your experience in using any OWASP material - you got yourself a slot... you get the point.

So please help us run this OWASP Local Chapter. If you'd like to give a talk or have any idea on how to improve the meetings, don't hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,
Sven
