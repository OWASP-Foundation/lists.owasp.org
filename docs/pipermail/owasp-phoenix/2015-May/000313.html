&gt;<i> Dear Owasp-phoenix Subscribers,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm excited to announce the next Phoenix OWASP chapter meeting, which will be held at UAT (Room #205) on Tuesday, May 05, 2015.  Please put this on your calendars and join us while we revive the chapter.  Let's keep the great momentum going since CactusCon; it was awesome seeing the community again.
</I>
All, 

I&#8217;m excited as well. I just recently joined the group and saw (and heard from someone else) that the status of the group was unknown, possibly defunct or getting there, so I&#8217;m happy to see some renewed energy from those interested. A brief introduction of myself &#8212; I&#8217;ve been a software developer for 23 years, and for the past 7 years, had a small mobile app development shop in Gilbert (Big Hill Software). In 2008 I founded the Phoenix iOS Developer Group and hosted it for two years &#8212; during which time we grew our group/list membership to over 700 and were getting around 40 people to monthly meetings around the time I handed off the reins. During that time the group got good attention / exposure from the AZ Republic, Phoenix Business Journal, and Apple themselves, as we were invited into 4 of their 5 area retail stores for demos and business workshops. All in all, that was a great ride, and it is a lot of fun to be with a user group where there&#8217;s interest and energy. 

As my career has landed me in the security area several times, I&#8217;m now ramping to begin offering security-related consulting and services, so I&#8217;ve been immersing myself in the local security community. I was at CactusCon and enjoyed it thoroughly. I am really looking forward to attending the meeting Tuesday and meeting anyone who attends. 

Cheers, 

Brad
