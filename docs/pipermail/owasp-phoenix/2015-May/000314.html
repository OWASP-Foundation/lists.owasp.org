<PRE>Hello Everyone,

Just a heads up that the meeting room has changed to room #136, which is
the auditorium, still at UAT. Details have been updated on the Chapter
Page: <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix.">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix.</A>

Andre - I hear you and I completely agree with the need to mixup the dates
&amp; possibly venues, so that folks with consistent scheduling &amp; location
conflicts can attend.  Unfortunately I won't be able to attend Cigital's
networking event this Thursday, but entertaining a 1st Thursdays networking
event sounds like a great idea.  Let me know how those discussions go and
if there is enough interest, we should take action to make the event
official.

Sincerely,
Joaquin Fuentes

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear Owasp-phoenix Subscribers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm excited to announce the next Phoenix OWASP chapter meeting, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be held at UAT (Room #205) on Tuesday, May 05, 2015.  Please put this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on your calendars and join us while we revive the chapter.  Let's keep the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> great momentum going since CactusCon; it was awesome seeing the community
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Joaquin and others,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tuesdays are going to be bad for me, including this week, and ultimately,
</I>&gt;<i> forever. Excited about reviving the chapter and hope to see other events,
</I>&gt;<i> or other days of the week where events will be switched to or planned for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few years ago when the chapter was AWESOME (thanks to Pete R, Andrew W,
</I>&gt;<i> etc), Skyler B couldn't attend on Tuesdays, which left a gap in our
</I>&gt;<i> community. If I do end up becoming a similar gap -- I hope that others rise
</I>&gt;<i> to the occasion and attend these excellent networking and learning
</I>&gt;<i> opportunities afforded to you by the OWASP community.

</I>&gt;<i>  Title: iOS App Attack and Defense (OWASP Mobile Top 10 Edition)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Presenter: Seth Law
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/nVisium/Swift.nV">https://github.com/nVisium/Swift.nV</A>).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See, now I'm really mad that I can't come with my Apple Watch. Had so many
</I>&gt;<i> questions about the WatchKit apps (watch-side) and extensions
</I>&gt;<i> (iDevice-side), especially around InterfaceController.swift,
</I>&gt;<i> awakeWithContext, labels, and image/table views. It makes me wonder if the
</I>&gt;<i> model presentation mode will be subject to UI redress attacks -- especially
</I>&gt;<i> with the rich Notification capabilities
</I>&gt;<i> (WKUserNotificationInterfaceController class). Curious if the flash is
</I>&gt;<i> encrypted since the App Groups allow files to pass between the devices.
</I>&gt;<i> Last, but not least, very curious about how the Apple Watch implements NFC,
</I>&gt;<i> EMV, and Apple Pay -- <A HREF="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/86352/140">http://security.stackexchange.com/a/86352/140</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have time later this week, I'll be at The Stockyards for an
</I>&gt;<i> open-networking event hosted by Cigital, Thursday, May 7th, starting at
</I>&gt;<i> 6PM. The address is 5009 E Washington St, Phoenix, 85034. If anyone shows,
</I>&gt;<i> then perhaps we can discuss hosting on-going, open-networking
</I>&gt;<i> professional's happy-hour OWASP events on first-of-the-month Thursdays
</I>&gt;<i> going forward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not trying to steal Joaquin's thunder, but I do like to stir up the pot
</I>&gt;<i> (and trying to leverage lessons learned from our past Phoenix OWASP
</I>&gt;<i> failings). OWASP Austin (at least when I lived there) did host two separate
</I>&gt;<i> events: one during the day (lunch 'n learn style) at a corporate HQ -- and
</I>&gt;<i> a separate, professional's happy-hour meetup at a local Irish bar. Any
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts or comments are welcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All my best,
</I>&gt;<i> Andre
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
