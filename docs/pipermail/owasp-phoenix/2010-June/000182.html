<PRE>All,

Just wanted to shoot out a reminder that tonight we have Rich Mogul from
Securosis back to speak with us!  If you can attend, this is going to be a
GREAT presentation.  Look forward to seeing you all then!

Details

Tuesday June 1st 2010 6:30 - 7:30 PM at University of Advancing Technology

Involuntary Case Studies in Data Breaches, Rich Mogull, Securosis

It's absolutely bass ackwards, but while the bad guys constantly share
details of their exploits, including techniques, when it comes to real
incidents, actual defenders rarely talk about what worked, and what didn't.
Our entire industry is built on anecdote and the few tidbits we can glean
from press reports. Thus we, as an industry, don't link means and methods to
actual security outcomes. Without this information we're like a bunch of
blindfolded wannabe ninjas trying to catch rounds from a machine gun with
our bare hands. In this session we'll name names as we build in-depth case
studies based on publicly available information, some of which isn't overly
public. We will combine these with the latest information from breach
reports released by incident response companies and the Dataloss Database.
The session will build a picture of how real breaches happen, which security
controls really work, and which compliance checkboxes are a complete and
total waste of time.

Drinks will be found afterword at Doc &amp; Eddies.

Doc &amp; Eddy's, 909 East Minton Drive, Tempe, AZ 85282-7021
