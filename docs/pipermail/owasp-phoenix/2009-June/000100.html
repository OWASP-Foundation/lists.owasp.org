<PRE>Please join the Phoenix Linux Users Group Security Team as we welcome
a guest presentation from Steven Kaplan covering FreeIPA.

BIO: Steven D Kaplan, MSCS, BSEE, CISSP
Waxman Associates, LLC

Mr. Kaplan has extensive experience in all areas of computer and
network security, from instructor to practitioner. His combined
problem solving, insights, innovations, programming and integration
techniques have saved companies (in some cases) millions of dollars in
fines avoided and achieved huge optimizations in their processes &#8211;
gains not strictly limited to computer security. He holds relevant
industry certifications, like the CISSP and IBM certifications for
Ethical Hacker and Security Consultant. Mr. Kaplan has done
significant amounts of software development to optimize his security
consulting effectiveness. This includes process automation, especially
related to collecting network security vulnerabilities, user ID
revalidation, and SOX compliance Some tools and programs are currently
in patent review.

Activities over the last 20 years cover both Federal Government (NSA)
INFOSEC experience and private sector work from all areas and
industries. Technological experience includes evaluation of Role Based
Access Control (RBAC) systems, Java software review (for
vulnerabilities), ethical hacking (EH) as well as design, evaluation,
certification and accreditation (C&amp;A) of security architectures and
infrastructures. Evaluated systems and networks of varied
architectures, including service-oriented architecture (SOA) for
security vulnerabilities and legislative requirements compliance.

Audit experience includes review for compliance to Sarbanes-Oxley and
HIPAA regulations, and the development of specialized software tools
and scripts to expedite compliance.

FreeIPA Discussion Abstract
Over the years, as a security practitioner, I have had to support the
forward progress and integration of user identity management systems.
Usually this goes in fits and starts, as companies try to migrate to
their best guess as to the where their technology should be so that
they can be compliant with legislative and fiduciary requirements.

While I have had to work with proprietary solustions, I have been on
the look for an open source program that would meet or exceed what
(expensive) solutions I had to deal with. FreeIPA, while in its
infancy, threatens to become the 800 pound gorilla in this area, being
the vehicle to which most modern identity manange systems can
integrates.

FreeIPA is an integrated security information management solution
combining Linux (Fedora), Fedora Directory Server, MIT Kerberos, NTP,
DNS. It consists of a web interface and command-line administration
tools. Currently it supports identity management with plans to support
policy and auditing management. <A HREF="http://freeipa.org">http://freeipa.org</A>

Discussion Overview:

&#183; Motivations, historical, experiential and legislative

&#183; Basic principles, CIA, IAAA, and Identity Management

&#183; What are features should a current IDM have? Does FreeIPA meet them?

&#183; Current release information, demonstration, install issues
