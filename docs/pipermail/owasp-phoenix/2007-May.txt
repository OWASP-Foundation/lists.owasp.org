As a heads-up for those interested, keep an eye on http://metabug.org/
for an upcoming presentation by Marcus Ranum toward the end of this
month. If things go as planned the presentation will be viewable live,
and questions from the peanut gallery may be submitted on
irc.freenode.net channel #metabug.

Happy Hacking!
