Hello Everyone,

 

I hope everyone had a great holiday and a happy New Years.  I am really

The next OWASP meeting is scheduled for Thursday, January 11th from

Agenda

 6:30 to 6:45 News & Introductions

 6:45 to 7:45 (1 hour): Data at Risk - Brian Christian

 

Data at Risk - Protecting Web Applications Throughout the Development Lifecycle
from Hackers 


In September 2006, Mitre released statistics revealing that Web application
security issues had claimed the top three spots for the most prevalent
vulnerabilities being discovered in open source and commercial software. As
evidenced by the growing number of corporate scandals that have occurred due
to confidential data being accessed via Web hacks, securing public and
private Web applications and Web services is now a top priority for many in
the application development lifecycle. 

 

This session will define what Web application security is and why it is
needed throughout the entire development lifecycle. We will discuss common
vulnerabilities in the Web application layer and why they are so easily
exploited. This session demonstrates how to defend against common attacks at
the Web application layer with examples covering Web application hacking
methods such as SQL Injection, Blind SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting
(XSS), Parameter Manipulation, etc. We will also review how compliance and
regulatory legislation such as PCI, GLBA, HIPAA, CASB 1386, and
Sarbanes-Oxley, etc. specifically relates to and affects Web application
security. Additionally, we will examine how security throughout the
development lifecycle is essential to the security of Web application code
and the protection of proprietary data.

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Comments welcome regarding Phoenix/Tools
Message-ID: <2fd9390e0701181903m2e28d238jc47d93ba705ed764@mail.gmail.com>

I put up a list of tools for web application security at:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix/Tools

This list is also linked off of the main page (the Phoenix OWASP main
page, not the OWASP main page).

I would sure like anybody to comment on the initial list, to see if I
missed your favorite or what not.  You can reply to me off-list if you
would rather keep it private.

I haven't included any command-line tools or footprinting tools yet
(e.g. googlegath, fierce, etc).  I do have gaps in other areas I'd
like to build on quite a bit more (web application honeypots,
operating system or library protection for browsers, and a bunch of
other topics).

Also exciting is that the first link is to the Alpha version of the
OWASP LiveCD ISO image for booting from CD.  I booted it in Vmware but
that's about it so far.  If you get it working for you and do
something interesting - post it here or create your own page about it!

Cheers,
Andre Gironda

Dre,

Awesome list! 

I have a bunch of web app security articles linked on a del.icio.us page
