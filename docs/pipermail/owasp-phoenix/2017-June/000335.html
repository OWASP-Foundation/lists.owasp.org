<PRE>Agreed, and done. A few years ago OWASP was all but defunct and Joaquin has lead the charge to resurrect it. As someone who has lead a sizable tech user group in the past, I can attest to the fact that while it may look trivial, it is a lot of hard work and very time consuming. I have really appreciated Joaquin&#8217;s efforts, and the quality of the meeting content. I&#8217;m already looking forward to July&#8217;s meet-up!&#160;

For those wanting to nominate &#8212; they ask for full name and email address..here is what I had:&#160;

Joaquin Fuentes

You don&#8217;t have to nominate for all categories, but they do require all nominations to be filled out, just put &#8220;NONE&#8221; in the ones you aren&#8217;t nominating for as fields are required.&#160;

Hi All - Joaquin has put a LOT of work into making the Phoenix OWASP Chapter a great experience.&#160; If you agree, please consider nominating Joaquin for a Waspy award here before June 30th:

Joaquin did NOT ask me to do this, but I visit a LOT of different ITSec meetings all over the US and Phoenix OWASP has been GREAT since Joaquin stepped up.
Please help me ensure Joaquin gets the recognition he deserves.
The deadline is June 30th, so please don't procrastinate.
Thanks!

Andy
