<PRE>*Mr. RFC is cold droppin' knowledge at AZSPF this evening!

Application Security for your Average InfoSec Professional*:  At the
November '09 AZSPF meeting we will discuss Application Security.


*What:* AZ Security Practitioners ' Forum
*When:* November 23, 2009 - 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM
*Where:*  University of Advancing Technology, Baseline &amp; I-10, Tempe
*Why:* It will be interesting.
*Presenter: *Andre Gironda
 *Topic:* Application Security for your Average InfoSec Professional
* This presentation will cover application security policy examples.
Should you have one and what goes into it? Once written, how do you go
about enacting the principles and controls behind an application
security policy? Let's talk about the best-path -- going from
application security illiterate to handling uncooperative developers,
messy source code, complex hardening &amp; coding standards, realtime
appsec monitoring/logging, and notoriously blackhat appsec
pen-testing.*
** *Bio:*
Andre Gironda is an independent security researcher involved mostly in
web application security projects. His contributions include work on
the OWASP Top Ten 2007, OWASP Podcast News team, and speaking
engagements at local OWASP events on topics ranging from verification
standards to problems with trusting the same-origin policy. Andre has
worked for a number of companies in risk management,
security-qa-developer, and network testing roles, including labs deep
within Cisco Systems as well as many years in an operations role at
eBay.
