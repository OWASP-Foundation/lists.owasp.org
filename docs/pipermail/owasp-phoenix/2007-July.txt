Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Thursday July 12 OWASP
Message-ID: <1184126447.6203.104.camel@suntzu>

We had both speakers for Thursdays meeting cancel due to unexpected
happenstance.

That's OK - OWASP is still happening!

Unless someone can pull another presentation out of their... hat, we
will meet at UAT for chapter business at the usual time, 6:30 PM, and
then head to...

Dos Gringos South Tempe Mexigrill
8000 S. Priest Rd
Tempe, AZ 85284
Ph: 480.753.4577
http://www.dosgringosaz.com/south_tempe_main.html

Tilted Kilt has been great, but with the new ownership came higher
prices, and shrunken order sizes. Not being a slave to tradition, it
seemed like a good reason to move our post-meeting social gathering. 

Looking forward to seeing you all!

-Adam

Just wanted to make everyone aware of something going on at OWASP at an
international level - what do you all think of moving the date of our
meeting in Sept a week up to coincide with this event?

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Live 0 : Day of Worldwide OWASP 1 day conferences
	on the topic	"Privacy in the 21st Century" : Thursday 6th Sep 2007
Message-ID: <1185312776.10442.37.camel@suntzu>

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Live_O

Our chapter is set to participate.


The topic of the event is "Privacy in the 21st Century", so all talks
should be related to it (we should be addressing the Web Application
side of Privacy (for example what happens to Privacy with SQL Injection,
XSS and issues like pdp's Snoop onto Them as they Snoop onto us)
      * The event will have 4 to 5 speaking slots (can be 30m if
        required)
      * All events are recommended to have the same panel discussion on
        the subject "What is the current state of Privacy on Web
        Application Security? and what should we be focusing on?").
        After the panel discussion, each local chapters is invited to
        create a summary of its conclusions for publishing on the OWASP
        website

Looking for volunteers to speak and for the panel discussion!

We will invite some local press so this is a good opportunity for some
web app sec exposure!

How many going to DEFCON or BlackHat?

I will be in LV during BlackHat but at DEFCON.

Anyone up for planning a Phoenix OWASP Get Together during the DEFCON
festivities, like maybe for dinner one of the nights?

Still looking for participants for OWASP-LIVE for Global Security Week!
If no one volunteers I'll pretend like you agreed to while drunk at
DEFCON. :>

Sept 15

I'm giving 3 talks about web app sec there - I'd like to see some of you
show up and do the same... 

...but don't sign up to talk there until you sign up to give a talk at
Live-O Phoenix. I'm working on getting the location locked down at which
point we can get it organized and turn it into a Phoenix web app sec
conference! 

I already am getting some other interesting speakers lined up.
