Security enthusiasts,

We're lucky enough to have another speaker from out-of-town again, speaking
on a very important topic in the industry.

See the details and RSVP on meetup.com:
https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Phoenix/events/255429881/

In this session, Marija will talk on the tech world from a woman?s point of
view, discussing how she got to where she is today, how Mentoring and
Passion are what really propel you forward, (along with helping you pay it
forward!), and of course, she?ll talk about Security.
