An account that was joined to my Google Apps account three years ago was
never removed by a company I contracted for.

The issue has been resolved (Google disabled the account).  My account has
the password regularly changed, of course!

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] OWASP Phoenix: Tomorrow's meeting
Message-ID: <CAANLsN9zjZrN6TPkPyYN+8rRR=_HHRj4G=oTR8LNv_m_ByDQPg@mail.gmail.com>

Just a friendly reminder, Ken Johnson will be speaking tomorrow on his
wxFramework project, a framework modeled after metasploit which helps
penetration testers with exploitation of web applications.

I would urge you SERIOUSLY to consider making this event and inviting as
many friends as you can get out for this.  If we can get lots of people in,
it will really help us reach out to others to come into our fine city.

Bio:

Ken Johnson is a Senior Application Security Consultant performing source
code
analysis and web application penetration testing. Ken is the primary
developer
of the Web Exploitation Framework (wXf) and contributes to various open
source application security projects. He has spoken at AppSec DC, OWASP
NoVA, Northern Virginia Hackers Association and is a contributor to the
Attack
Research team.

Abstract:

The project?s goal is to assist penetration testers in exploiting web
application
and web service weaknesses. Because exploitation of applications is rarely
point
and click and usually requires multiple steps, network exploitation
frameworks
often fall short of the goal. The framework is intended to assist attackers
along
their exploitation journey. During this talk we will preview the new
graphical
interface for the first time and demonstrate how it changes or enhances the
reasons you may wish to try wXf.

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Phoenix OWASP 11/1 [please read]
Message-ID: <CAANLsN_9-+sAkrUw58RNxyh5ohL8T-=LRBGqjwVBs_N16TM-RQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Super sorry for the late notice, but we've got a few points of order to
discuss for the meeting tomorrow.  First, we've been displaced.  UAT is
doing their annual tech forum, and we don't have the venue we normally do.
 We are moving this meeting, however, to a super awesome shiny new
location, Terra Lever, on mill avenue.  The address is: 425 South Mill Ave,
suite 201, Tempe, Arizona 85281.  This also means that beer afterwords will
also be down-town somewhere decided at the meeting.  Same time (6:30 pm) to
start.

Second point of order is that we have a great talk lined up for the next
meeting.  Scott White is going to talk on application security practices,
beyond just the traditional views.   Scott always gives a great talk, so
seriously try and make this talk :-)

Finally, We are going to also spend some time in the beginning of the next
two meetings to showcase an overview of OWASP for the many new folks who've
just recently started to attend.  Please expect these next two meetings to
run a bit later than normal.

Scott's talk is defined as below.  Please email me or Pete if you have any
further questions.

Title:
Application Security: More Than Just Secure Coding Practices

Abstract:
>From a penetration tester's perspective, this presentation will examine a
holistic approach to managing application security since attack vectors are
not adequately mitigated using secure coding practices and traditional code
reviews.

Bio:
Scott is a Senior Information Security Engineer at Diebold, Inc., holding a
bachelors degree in computer science, a master's degree in network
security, and is well-respected in the information security industry. He
manages the global application security process ensuring that new and
existing applications conform to industry and secure coding best practices.
Additionally, he heads up offensive security efforts within Diebold,
continually testing its systems and associates through penetration tests,
product reviews, and social engineering exercises. He has held various past
positions in support, system administration, web development, penetration
testing, and application security for both public and private organizations
servicing clients in the government and commercial spaces. His experience
includes performing web application security assessments, internal,
external, and physical penetration tests, source code reviews, social
engineering, and developer training. With over 5 years working directly
with information security and over 10 years programming experience, he has
a thorough web application security understanding from both developer and
attacker viewpoints. He has spoken at Defcon, the world?s largest hacker?s
convention, and has also been called on by organizations such as the FBI
and Secret Service as a subject matter expert. He is the technical editor
for the popular book, "Metasploit The Penetration Tester's Guide".
