Enterprise Data Security and Encryption, Adrian Lane, Analyst/CTO -
Securosis:


Taking a pragmatic look at data security, we follow the progression of data
breaches and highlight some of the problems that most enterprises fail to
address, and then examine uses of encryption to address issues of data
security. We focus on the use of encryption inside, and outside, the
enterprise as a method to secure data from common attacks, breaches and
leaks.
 &#8226; Why they fail: A look at breaches and data security.
&#8226; Why encrypt data? Where to encrypt data? What are the pros and cons of
different solutions?
 &#8226; The weakest link: The need for a complete program.
&#8226; Encryption as part of the business process.



Bio:

Adrian is an Analyst/CTO with the security research firm Securosis. Adrian
brings over 22 years of industry experience to the Securosis team, much of
it at the executive level. Adrian specializes in database security, data
security, and software development. With experience at Ingres, Oracle, and
Unisys, he has extensive experience in the vendor community, but brings a
pragmatic perspective to selecting and deploying technologies having worked
on &quot;the other side&quot; as CIO in the finance vertical. Prior to joining
Securosis, Adrian served as the CTO/VP at companies such as IPLocks,
Touchpoint, CPMi and Transactor/Brodia. He has been invited to present at

systems at Stanford University.
