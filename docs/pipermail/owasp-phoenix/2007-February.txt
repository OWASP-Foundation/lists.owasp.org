Agenda

 6:30 to 6:45 News & Introductions

 6:45 to 7:45 (1 hour): Reflections on Trusting the Same-Origin Policy - and
other web+network trust issues - Andre Gironda, Independent Vulnerability
Assessor / Researcher


In computing, the same origin policy is an important security measure for
client-side scripting (mostly Javascript). It prevents a document or script
loaded from one "origin" from getting or setting properties of a document
from a different "origin". It was designed to protect browsers from
executing code from external websites, which could be malicious. 

 

XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities exploit trust shared between a user and a
website by circumventing the same-domain policy. DNS Pinning didn't pan out
exactly right, either. Can client-side scripting allow malicious code to get
into your browser history and cache? Can it enumerate what plugins you have
installed in your browser, or even programs you have installed to your
computer? Can it access and modify files on your local hard drive or other
connected filesystems? Can client-side scripts be used to access and control
everything you access online? Can it be used to scan and attack your
Intranet / local network? Does an attacker have to target you in order to
pull off one of these attacks successfully? If I turn off Javascript or use
NoScript, am I safe? What other trust relationships does the web application
n-Tier model break?

I am always looking for new speakers and topics so feel free to send me an
email if you're interested.   

 

 Thanks,
