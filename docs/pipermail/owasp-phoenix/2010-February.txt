Executrain isn't open today - so we're just going to meet at Taste of Topps!
I'm sure there will be no complaints ;)

Do you have people that want to speak at your chapter and you want to have a
democratic process to ensure that the topics are vendor agnostic and the
content is awesome?

Need to give kudos to the folks at  EASY CHAIR  http://www.easychair.org for
a FREE solution to this common chapter problem.

Step #1
Pick a few people at your local chapter that want to be the speaker police
(developers,industry people, vendors, education etc..) and give them that
role

Step #2
Set up EasyChair

Step #3
Add a link to your submission system on your chapter wiki  (Example
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/NYNJMetro see: HOW-TO)

Step #4
HAVE FUN stop stepping.. this allows your chapter to expand and gives others
a voice in your chapter to make it even BETTER!!

Disclaimer: Ok so we have 150+ people show up at meetings and speaker
submissions coming out of our ears.. but this is a cool solution to spread
the workload on picking content speakers.  I have to thank the guys in
Sweden for turning me on to EasyChair - thanks John!

~Brennan
