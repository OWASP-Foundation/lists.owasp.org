Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Initial OWASP Meeting
Message-ID: <003801c70505$0deb2c80$1200080a@DVDA>

Thank you all for helping to make the first OWASP meeting a success!  I am
always looking for topics and ideas for upcoming talks, I have a few listed
on the wiki (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix) but please update it
with any additional talks you would like to see.  If anyone would like to
talk at one of the upcoming meetings please send me an email.  Also, please
sign up for the chapter mailing list for future chapter communications.  I
will have the slides from the Google CodeSearch presentation up on the site
within the next day or so.

 

As for the next meeting, we are planning on having Brian Christian from SPI
Dynamics give a presentation on using a hybrid testing approach to identify
application vulnerabilities.  Below is Brian's bio and talk abstract:

 

Brian Christian 

Co-founder and Application Security Engineer

S.P.I. Dynamics, Inc.

 

Brian Christian is co-founder and an Application Security Engineer for SPI
Dynamics, the expert in Web application security assessment and testing.
Brian has over 11 years of experience in high tech positions within the
information technology industry with the last eight years of his career
focused exclusively in Internet security. His current role with SPI Dynamics
provides an ideal venue for his leadership and visionary capabilities. 

 

Brian's successful career includes key security positions at Lucent
Technologies, Security First Technologies and Internet Security Systems
(ISS). While at Security First, the first online banking company, Brian
helped to establish the baseline of Internet financial commerce and also
created security policies for several Web-based Internet banking sites
throughout America and Europe. While at ISS, Brian helped to create the
standard for the industry's first penetration and vulnerability assessment
models. Brian has spoken on the topic of Web application security at
numerous conferences including SANS, Infosec Canada, ISACA Audit Conference,
ISSA and ISACA Chapter Meetings, Infosecurity and CSI.

ABSTRACT: Taking a Hybrid Approach to Ensuring Your Web Application Code is
Secure

As Web application vulnerabilities skyrocketed over the past few years,
developers are beginning to take security very seriously. A new class of
products has emerged that enable developers to test the security of their
Web applications during implementation called source code analyzers. But
source code analysis tools prove to be only a partial solution because they
are only able to infer, or guess, what the actual system behavior will be,
and can only determine what security vulnerabilities might be possible in
the application. To increase the fidelity of security testing results,
developers should look to security testing products that feature a
combination of analysis techniques of source code analysis and more
practical approach called black box testing, also known as dynamic analysis.


 

This session discusses the difference between source code and black box
testing and how the combination, or hybrid analysis, produces the accurate
and reliable security information developers need to assess the security of
their code.

Thanks,
