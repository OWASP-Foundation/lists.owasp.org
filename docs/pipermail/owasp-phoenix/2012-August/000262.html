<PRE>I've been on ASU's Information Security team for several years and in my opinion it is a great place to work.

We have one junior level position open and one senior level. Although the senior position title says &quot;Architect&quot; it entails a full range of security related projects from proactive measures (vulnerability testing, network redesigns) to auditor-like stuff such as detective and preventive controls.

For an intro to some of our work see the Information Security web site <A HREF="http://getprotected.asu.edu/">http://getprotected.asu.edu/</A> or the University Technology Office site <A HREF="https://uto.asu.edu/">https://uto.asu.edu/</A>  (The UTO is the central IT organization for ASU, while departments also have their own IT teams.)

I cannot help you to the head of the line, however, so please use the links provided if you are interested. I don't want to clutter the OWASP email list, so I'd discourage reply-all type discussions.
