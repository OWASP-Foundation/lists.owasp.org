<PRE>Hi All - my name's Andy and I'm the Denver OWASP Chapter Leader and an
HP employee.  Our marketing team is setting up an event at Fleming's

Join us for lunch and an informative discussion about &quot;Top Security
Threats and Trends&quot; on Tuesday, June 19, 2012.

Fleming's Prime Steakhouse &amp; Wine Bar
June 19, 2012
11:30 am
6333 N. Scottsdale Road
Scottsdale, AZ 82520
(480) 596-8265

Enterprise organizations have been under security attacks for the past
decade, but security events in 2011 have created a ripple effect that
will be felt for years to come and will actually start to shift the
way we view security.  In the 2011 Cyber Security Risks Report, HP
Enterprise Security provides a broad view of the vulnerability threat
landscape, as well as in-depth research and analysis on security
attacks and trends. At this luncheon we will highlight the latest
threat trends and risks that enterprise organizations face today &#8211; and
to help prioritize mitigation strategies.
Join us for this informative luncheon and you will learn:
&#8226; Why a decline in vulnerabilities disclosed may lead to a false sense
of security
&#8226; How changing attack motivations are increasing security risks
&#8226; What the biggest risks to the enterprise were in 2011
All attendees will receive a link to download the &quot;2011 Cyber Security
Risk Report&quot;.
</PRE>
