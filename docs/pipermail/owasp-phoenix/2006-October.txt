Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] New Googledorking file and directory enumeration
	technique
Message-ID: <1160666283.5660.711.camel@localhost>

While messing around with the Google Webmaster tools I discovered a way
to use the new-ish Sitemap.xml spec to enumerate files and directories
due to lousy xml generating scripts which seem to be all over the place
these days.

Oh - welcome to Phoenix OWASP and check out the meeting location info if
you haven't seen it yet!  http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix

Best regards
Adam
