</I>&gt;<i>  *SharePoint Hacking - Advanced SharePoint Security Tools and Tips*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Speaker: *Francis Brown -Stach &amp; Liu
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft SharePoint products and technologies continue to grow in
</I>&gt;<i> popularity and have become the core foundation upon which many organizations
</I>&gt;<i> have built their web presence. Unfortunately, guidance concerning common
</I>&gt;<i> SharePoint security issues tends to be overly complex and often
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstood. Ultimately this results in insecurely configured and deployed
</I>&gt;<i> SharePoint instances in production environments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This demonstration rich presentation will cover our newly released
</I>&gt;<i> SharePoint hacking tools and techniques that security professionals can
</I>&gt;<i> easily use to identify and exploit common insecure configurations in
</I>&gt;<i> SharePoint applications. Some of the areas we&#8217;ll attempt to tackle are:
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; Identifying vulnerable SharePoint applications using public search
</I>&gt;<i> engines such as Google and Bing
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; Gaining unauthorized access to SharePoint administrative web interfaces
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; Exploiting holes in SharePoint site user permissions and inheritance
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; Illustrating the dangers of granting excessive access to normal user
</I>&gt;<i> accounts
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; Pillaging Active Directory via insecure SharePoint services
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; Attacking 3rd party plugins/code within SharePoint
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; And much more&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Bio:**
</I>&gt;<i> Francis Brown, CISA, CISSP, MCSE, is a Managing Partner at Stach &amp; Liu, a
</I>&gt;<i> security consulting firm providing IT security services to the Fortune 500
</I>&gt;<i> and global financial institutions as well as U.S. and foreign governments.
</I>&gt;<i> Before joining Stach &amp; Liu, Francis served as an IT Security Specialist with
</I>&gt;<i> the Global Risk Assessment team of Honeywell International where he
</I>&gt;<i> performed network and application penetration testing, product security
</I>&gt;<i> evaluations, incident response, and risk assessments of critical
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure. Prior to that, Francis was a consultant with the Ernst &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> Young Advanced Security Centers and conducted network, application,
</I>&gt;<i> wireless, and remote access penetration tests for Fortune 500 clients.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Francis has presented his research at leading conferences such as InfoSec
</I>&gt;<i> World, Black Hat USA, and DEFCON, and has been cited in numerous industry
</I>&gt;<i> and academic publications.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Francis holds a Bachelor of Science and Engineering from the University
</I>&gt;<i> of Pennsylvania with a major in Computer Science and Engineering and a minor
</I>&gt;<i> in Psychology. While at Penn, Francis taught operating system
</I>&gt;<i> implementation, C programming, and participated in DARPA-funded research
</I>&gt;<i> into advanced intrusion prevention system techniques.
