Enterprise Data Security and Encryption, Adrian Lane, Analyst/CTO -
Securosis:


Taking a pragmatic look at data security, we follow the progression of data
breaches and highlight some of the problems that most enterprises fail to
address, and then examine uses of encryption to address issues of data
security. We focus on the use of encryption inside, and outside, the
enterprise as a method to secure data from common attacks, breaches and
leaks.
 ? Why they fail: A look at breaches and data security.
? Why encrypt data? Where to encrypt data? What are the pros and cons of
different solutions?
 ? The weakest link: The need for a complete program.
? Encryption as part of the business process.
