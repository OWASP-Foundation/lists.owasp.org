Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Web App Developer Security Training in San Diego -
	Dec 3-7 - 3	Tracks
Message-ID: <1194844506.6281.19.camel@suntzu>

QuietMove has successfully taught our web application security training
to a large number of organizations in a private training format. Now,
for the for the first time, we're delivering this hands-on, lab-driven
training in a public forum.

This training will be conducted in North County, San Diego (think the
Sorrento Valley, La Jolla, Del Mar area). Lunch is included - sponsored
by Fortify Software. Significant discounts are available for friends of
Phoenix OWASP and other travelers. Group hotel rates and transportation
to/from the airport are being arranged.

The details are in my email signature - let me know if you would like
additional information.
We're also planning classes for Phoenix in Q1 2008. 

Best regards,
Adam
