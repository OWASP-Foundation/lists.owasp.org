Obfuscating Search Queries with Hayst.ac

David Huerta



Hayst.ac, is a browser userscript to obfuscate search queries with
machine-generated queries with the goal to be as close to indistinguishable
from the human generated ones as possible. This is ultimately to discourage
the use of search histories as a source of user profiling.



Bio:

After arriving in Arizona from the posh, cosmopolitan enclave of
southeastern Idaho, David founded the DeVry Linux User Group (DeLUG) in
2003, an originally student organization that drew members and activities
from the greater West Valley Free software community, including students at
GCC and ASU West.  He also serves on the board of directors for HeatSync
Labs, a hackerspace in Chandler.





OWASP O2 Platform

Dinis Cruz**





The O2 Platform is focused on automating application security knowledge and
workflows. It is specifically designed for developers and security
consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough source
code-driven application security reviews (blackbox + whitebox). In addition
to the manual findings created/discovered by security consultants, the OWASP
O2 Platform allows the easy consumption of results from multiple OWASP
 projects
and commercial scanning tools. This allows security consultants to find,
exploit and automate (via Unit Tests) security vulnerabilities usually
dismissed by the community as impossible to find/recreate. More importantly,
it provides security consultants a mechanism to: (a) &quot;talk&quot; with developers
(via UnitTest),  (b) give developers a way to replicate + &quot;check if it's
fixed&quot; the vulnerabilities reported and (c) engage in a two-way conversion
on the best way to fix/remediate those vulnerabilities. For more details see

ASP.NET/J2EE Application Security, Application Security audits and .NET
Security Curriculum Development.

For the past couple years Dinis has focused on the field of Static Source
Code Analysis and Dynamic Website Assessments (aka penetration testing), and
is the main developer of the OWASP O2 Platform which is an Open Source
project that is focused on 'Automating Security Consultants
Knowledge/Workflows' and 'Allowing non-security experts to access and

Platform the industry standard for consuming, instrumenting and data-sharing
between: the multiple WebAppSec tools, the Security consultants and the
final users (from management to developers).
