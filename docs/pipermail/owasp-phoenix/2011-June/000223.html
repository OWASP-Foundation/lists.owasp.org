<PRE>You have been invited to the following event.

Title: OWASP Phoenix Meeting
OWASP Phoenix invites you to it's June meeting!

Two speakers this month.



Tuesday June 7th 2011 6:30 - 7:30 PM at University of Advancing Technology.  
The meetings are always free, unfortunately the drinks aren't.

University of Advancing Technology 2625 W. BASELINE RD. TEMPE, AZ 85283



Obfuscating Search Queries with Hayst.ac

David Huerta



Hayst.ac, is a browser userscript to obfuscate search queries with  
machine-generated queries with the goal to be as close to indistinguishable  
from the human generated ones as possible. This is ultimately to discourage  
the use of search histories as a source of user profiling.



Bio:

After arriving in Arizona from the posh, cosmopolitan enclave of  
southeastern Idaho, David founded the DeVry Linux User Group (DeLUG) in  
2003, an originally student organization that drew members and activities  
from the greater West Valley Free software community, including students at  
GCC and ASU West.  He also serves on the board of directors for HeatSync  
Labs, a hackerspace in Chandler.





OWASP O2 Platform

Dinis Cruz





The O2 Platform is focused on automating application security knowledge and  
workflows. It is specifically designed for developers and security  
consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough source  
code-driven application security reviews (blackbox + whitebox). In addition  
to the manual findings created/discovered by security consultants, the  
OWASP O2 Platform allows the easy consumption of results from multiple  
OWASP  projects and commercial scanning tools. This allows security  
consultants to find, exploit and automate (via Unit Tests) security  
vulnerabilities usually dismissed by the community as impossible to  
find/recreate. More importantly, it provides security consultants a  
mechanism to: (a) &quot;talk&quot; with developers (via UnitTest),  (b) give  
developers a way to replicate + &quot;check if it's fixed&quot; the vulnerabilities  
reported and (c) engage in a two-way conversion on the best way to  
fix/remediate those vulnerabilities. For more details see

For the past couple years Dinis has focused on the field of Static Source  
Code Analysis and Dynamic Website Assessments (aka penetration testing),  
and is the main developer of the OWASP O2 Platform which is an Open Source  
project that is focused on 'Automating Security Consultants  
Knowledge/Workflows' and 'Allowing non-security experts to access and

Platform the industry standard for consuming, instrumenting and  
data-sharing between: the multiple WebAppSec tools, the Security  
consultants and the final users (from management to developers).
