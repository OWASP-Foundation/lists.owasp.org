</I>
I applaud such an effort. I'm no longer in Phoenix (a former chapter
leader of OWASP), but you will find some good resources from this
group!

&gt;<i> 1)      How to protect against SQL injection attacks.
</I>&quot;SQL Injection Attacks&quot; book by Justin Clarke.

&gt;<i> 2)      How to protect against cross-site scripting, injection and session riding.
</I>&quot;Seven Deadliest Web Attacks&quot; book by Mike Shema (First chapter on XSS)

&gt;<i> 3)      HTTP response splitting.
</I>We call this &quot;HTTP Header Injection&quot; now. The tool, Burp Suite
Professional is very good at finding these types of vulnerabilities
and only costs 165 British Pounds (GBP)

&gt;<i> 4)      Best web security practices using Javascript.
</I>&quot;Web 2.0 Security: Defending Ajax, RIA, and SOA&quot; book by Shreeraj Shah
(a bit outdated and there are few upcoming books that will cover this.
I also suggest &quot;Hacking Exposed Web 2.0&quot; perhaps)

&gt;<i> 5)      How to secure Flash objects and Java applets.
</I>&quot;Web Application Hacker's Handbook&quot; by Dafydd Stuttard; Marcus Pinto
-- this book also covers the HTTP Header Injection issues above
nicely, as well ;&gt; One of my personal favorites!

&gt;<i> 6)      Securing XML libraries.
</I>I'm not exactly sure about this question (what do you mean by
&quot;securing XML libraries&quot;?), but &quot;Hunting Security Bugs&quot; from Microsoft
Press covers a lot of XML security issues in-depth (as does the &quot;Web
2.0 Security&quot; books above

&gt;<i> 7)      Secure code from scanning software to acquire information from online websites.
</I>&quot;Secure Programming with Static Analysis&quot; by Brain Chess and Jacob West

&gt;<i> 8)      The inside scoop on what an auditor or hacker does and how they attempt to break the applications.
</I>
You'll have to ask me. &quot;Auditor&quot; is an incorrect word (and so is
&quot;hacker&quot;). Most people refer to these best as &quot;application security
consultants&quot; or &quot;appsec consultants&quot;.

I prefer to use the terminology &quot;application assessment&quot; or &quot;app
assessment&quot; instead of &quot;source code audit&quot; or &quot;penetration-test&quot; or
&quot;ethical hacking&quot;.

Good appsec consultants will perform threat-modeling (see the
Microsoft book with the same name) in order to provide adversarial
security testing. This involves using a tool such as Burp Suite
Professional (mentioned above) to walk the web app. After a walk,
&quot;insertion points&quot; are identified, which usually consist of URLs,
parameters, forms, queries, cookies, and HTTP headers. Some &quot;insertion
points&quot; need to be identified separately by using a web browser (note:
Burp Pro requires a web browser, so you're already using one) and
downloading Javascript or SWF files.

After using the web browser and Burp Suite Professional to identify
insertion points, a good appsec consultant will map the URLs to source
code through a process known as &quot;code traversal&quot;. This requires deep
knowledge of the target application, its source code architecture,
internal code flow, and the ability to perform both &quot;data flow
analysis&quot; and &quot;code flow analysis&quot;. I use two tools to do this: 1)
Source Insight, which is a code editor/viewer, and 2) OWASP
CodeCrawler, another code viewer that requires Visual Studio
Professional 2008. Source Insight is just over 200 US dollars
(although a 30-day trial is downloadable for free) and Visual Studio
Professional 2008 can be had for as little as 70 US dollars
(especially now that Visual Studio Professional 2010 is available).

It is required to have lots of books available in order to understand
all of the code intricacies -- I suggest subscriptions to
SafariBooksOnline, Books24x7, Kindle for PC, and Google Books (Google
Editions Book Store will be out soon, as well).

&gt;<i> The next dates that are available are June 2 or July 7 from 3:30 - 5pm at the ASU Tempe Campus. I'm pretty sure we can reimburse your parking but beyond that about all we can offer is our undying gratitude! :)
</I>
I might be available to come visit during those times. Perhaps Andrew
or Pete (the current OWASP chapter leaders) can look into
accommodating me through the OWASP chapter visit program?

Thanks and Good luck,
Andre
