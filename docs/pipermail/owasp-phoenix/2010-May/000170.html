Redefining &amp; Understanding Security Posture&quot;* *Andrew Wilson*, (me)


One of the unfortunate realities of any industry is buzzword bingo. We often
take terms and throw them around because they sound cool, but generally
without any actual or well understood meaning. Security posture is one of
those terms, that while rather popular, isn't really used in a well defined
and functional fashion

This presentation will help better outline:

   - What is posture &amp; why is it important
   - How can be used to gain advantage, how can it be used against people
   - How does that have valuable meaning as it relates to the security
   industry.


The meeting will be held at:

6:30 PM - 7:30 PM, for about 1 hour
University of Advancing Technology 2625 W. BASELINE RD. TEMPE, AZ 85283-1056


Drinks will be found afterword at Doc &amp; Eddies.

Doc &amp; Eddy's, 909 East Minton Drive, Tempe, AZ 85282-7021
