Message-ID: <cb9225660910061101q3b1ec523x95dc83e736b71262@mail.gmail.com>

Date:Tuesday, October 6, 2009
Time: 6:30pm - 7:30pm
Location: Executrain - WEST side of bldg
Street: 3600 E University Dr # A1400City/Town: Phoenix, AZ


Andre Gironda will be back in Phoenix to present some great information
about using OWASP resources to build an effective Application Security
lifecycle/program, followed by

SUNSEC Happy Hour at Casey Moore's, at 7:30!

Using ASVS with the Code Review Guide, Testing Guide, and Time Management

The OWASP Application Security Verification Standards, which defines four
levels of web application security verification, lays down a framework for
security architecture review. While the ASVS includes many requirements for
controls, it does not suggest which tools, techniques, timeline or
methodologies to utilize. The OWASP Code Review and Testing Guides provide
the technical practices and suggest or hint at tools, but also lack the
timeline and methodology necessary to complete an application
penetration-test or SDLC integration project for proper application security
hygiene.

This presentation will provide the 1000 foot view all the way down to the
nitty gritty details of how to perform ASVS activities using OWASP
resources, as well as some OWASP and non-OWASP tools (freeware or demoware).
Example timelines for typical ASVS activities, including reports, will be
discussed so that any sort of application security project can be scoped
properly, delivered on-time, and within budget.

Andre Gironda is an application security specialist with a global security
consulting firm providing IT security services to the Fortune 500 and
financial institutions as well as U.S. and foreign governments. Prior to his
current employment, Andre held a number of payment application security
positions in addition to working for the largest online auction website. He
is currently a leader for the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP),
where he co-produces the global OWASP News Pod

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Nov 3rd meeting
Message-ID: <cb9225660910121025s5ae29333w8aafb8795dc4652a@mail.gmail.com>

I will be sharing the research I did for my contribution to the upcoming
Cloud Security Alliance mega-whitepaper/online book about cloud security. I
wrote the section about cloud vulnerability management.

I will be sharing:

   - Cloud security best practices for web apps, for the entire software
   development life cycle
   - Specific application functionality for which the risks can be amplified
   by the cloud model
   - For cloud customers, how to identify the level of security of a
   provider, and pick the provider that has the level of security you need
   - For cloud providers, advice on vulnerability management

6:30 Nov 3rd at the usual spot - Executrain Phoenix, followed by SunSec at
Casey Moore's at 7:45.

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Phoenix Linux User Group Security Lab Moves to
	First Wednesday @ 18:00 at John C. Lincoln Hospital Cowden Center
Message-ID: <d4e0a6fd0910280919u34b1c5u4ed9996e22954d94@mail.gmail.com>

*Brian Fields (aka AZ Rune) *will be both hosting the November Phoenix Linux
User Group and providing our monthly presentation content next Wednesday at
the Cowden Center of (HIPAA Compliant) John C. Lincoln North Mountain
Hospital from 18:00 until 20:30.

Hackfests are semi-quarterly events that provide open encroachment using
Linux Distro based pentest and exploit tools.  Hackfests require
registration, presentations do not.  Presentations are held in public venues
on community based networks, and provide no avenue for lab testing of
security tools.

*Hackfests always need build engineers, IDS and forensic staff people with
abilities in Snort, puppet and Backtrack4, Samari, DVL and OWASP tools.   *
*
There is an open call for monthly presentations; contact
lisakachold at obnosis.com.*

The Cowden Center is located in the North Mountain Hospital Complex at 9202
N. 2nd Street, Phoenix Arizona 85020.
PLUG uses the Auditorium #180 since we generally have up to 40 students and
professionals attend.
The NEW DAY and time for our winter series is the First Wednesday of every
month starting at 18:00 until 20:30 to give everyone a chance to show up
late or come earlier.

Presentation materials are available online the day of the event if you
could not attend.
