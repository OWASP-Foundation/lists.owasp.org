<PRE>July 18 Meeting Jim Manico &quot; Top Ten Web Defenses&quot; NOTE: Special date and
location

*OWASP Phoenix invites you to it's July meeting!  Free and open to everyone.
*


Title: Top Ten Web Defenses We cannot &#8220;firewall&#8221; or &#8220;patch&#8221; our way to
secure websites. In the past, security professionals thought firewalls,
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), patching, and privacy policies were enough.
Today, however, these methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on
prominent, well-protected websites are occurring every day. Most every
organization in the world have something in common &#8211; they have had websites
compromised in some way. No company or industry is immune. Programmers need
to learn to build websites differently. This talk will review the top
coding techniques developers need to master in order to build a low-risk,
high-security web application.


BIO: Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security, a
web security firm. He authors and delivers developer security awareness
training for WhiteHat Security and has a background building software as a
developer and architect for over 20 years. Jim is also a global board
member for the OWASP foundation where he helps drive the strategic vision
for the organization. He manages and participates in several OWASP
projects, including the OWASP cheat sheet series and several additional
secure coding projects.
