 Top Ten Web Defenses

Jim Manico, VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security



Top Ten Web Defenses:
We cannot &#8220;firewall&#8221; or &#8220;patch&#8221; our way to secure websites. In the past,
security professionals thought firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
patching, and privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these
methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on prominent,
well-protected websites are occurring every day. Website developers must
learn to code in a secure fashion to have any chance of providing
organizations with proper defenses in the current threat-scape. The
session will provide specific tips and guidelines to make website code
both low risk and less vulnerable.


Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat
Security. Jim is also a global board member of OWASP, is the host of the
OWASP Podcast Series, is the committee chair of the OWASP Connections
Committee, is the project manager of the OWASP Cheatsheet series, and is
a significant contributor to several additional OWASP projects. Jim
provides secure coding and developer awareness training for WhiteHat
Security using his 8+ years of experience delivering developer-training
courses for SANS, Aspect Security and others. He brings 16 years of
database-driven Web software development and analysis experience to
WhiteHat and OWASP as well. Jim works on the beautiful island of Kauai,
Hawaii where he lives with his wife Tracey.


Happy Hour to follow!
