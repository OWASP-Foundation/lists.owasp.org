 MS SQL Injection - Start to Finish

Scott White


This presentation will be a live hacking session demonstrating
reconnaissance, identification, and exploitation of SQL injection with
Microsoft SQL Server as the back end database.  SQL injection will be
performed from start to finish, showing various techniques for obtaining
data, and even fully compromising servers.  Both basic and advanced
exploitation techniques will be explored.

TrustedSec.  He has presented to organizations such as OWASP, ISSA, ISACA,
FBI's Infragard, and others.  He has also spoken at Defcon, and has been
called upon by organizations such as the FBI and Secret Service as a
subject matter expert.  He is the technical reviewer for the popular book,
&quot;Metasploit: The Penetration Tester's Guide&quot;.  He holds a bachelors degree
in Computer Science and a master's degree in Network Security.  He has held
various past positions in support, system administration, web development,
penetration testing, and application security for both public and private
sectors with clients in both government and commercial spaces.  His
experience includes performing web application security assessments,
internal, external, and physical penetration tests, source code reviews,
social engineering, and web application security training.  With over 10
years of programming experience coupled with offensive security testing, he
has a thorough web application security understanding from both developer
and attacker perspectives.
