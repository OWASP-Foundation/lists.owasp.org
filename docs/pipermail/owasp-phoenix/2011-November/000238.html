<PRE>All,

Two quick updates:

   1. In case my last email was unclear, we are meeting tonight at Terra
   Lever.  Scott is presenting on application security practices.  Andre is
   going to give a brief intro to OWASP as well.
   2. Scott also wanted to announce he was giving away an autographed copy
   of the new metasploit book from no-starch.  It does not come with free
   hugs, but it's a cool and somewhat rare item none the less.

Parking on mill can be annoying, and terra lever isn't always as obvious as
it could be.  For navigation purposes, terra lever is on the 2nd level of
what I believe is a bank-- directly across the street from starbucks.
 There is only one starbucks on mill, so it should make an easy navigation
point.  I will hang outside to route people in as needed.

-Andrew

&gt;<i> All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Super sorry for the late notice, but we've got a few points of order to
</I>&gt;<i> discuss for the meeting tomorrow.  First, we've been displaced.  UAT is
</I>&gt;<i> doing their annual tech forum, and we don't have the venue we normally do.
</I>&gt;<i>  We are moving this meeting, however, to a super awesome shiny new
</I>&gt;<i> location, Terra Lever, on mill avenue.  The address is: 425 South Mill
</I>&gt;<i> Ave, suite 201, Tempe, Arizona 85281.  This also means that beer
</I>&gt;<i> afterwords will also be down-town somewhere decided at the meeting.  Same
</I>&gt;<i> time (6:30 pm) to start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second point of order is that we have a great talk lined up for the next
</I>&gt;<i> meeting.  Scott White is going to talk on application security practices,
</I>&gt;<i> beyond just the traditional views.   Scott always gives a great talk, so
</I>&gt;<i> seriously try and make this talk :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, We are going to also spend some time in the beginning of the next
</I>&gt;<i> two meetings to showcase an overview of OWASP for the many new folks who've
</I>&gt;<i> just recently started to attend.  Please expect these next two meetings to
</I>&gt;<i> run a bit later than normal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scott's talk is defined as below.  Please email me or Pete if you have any
</I>&gt;<i> further questions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Title:
</I>&gt;<i> Application Security: More Than Just Secure Coding Practices
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Abstract:
</I>&gt;<i> From a penetration tester's perspective, this presentation will examine a
</I>&gt;<i> holistic approach to managing application security since attack vectors are
</I>&gt;<i> not adequately mitigated using secure coding practices and traditional code
</I>&gt;<i> reviews.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bio:
</I>&gt;<i> Scott is a Senior Information Security Engineer at Diebold, Inc., holding
</I>&gt;<i> a bachelors degree in computer science, a master's degree in network
</I>&gt;<i> security, and is well-respected in the information security industry. He
</I>&gt;<i> manages the global application security process ensuring that new and
</I>&gt;<i> existing applications conform to industry and secure coding best practices.
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, he heads up offensive security efforts within Diebold,
</I>&gt;<i> continually testing its systems and associates through penetration tests,
</I>&gt;<i> product reviews, and social engineering exercises. He has held various past
</I>&gt;<i> positions in support, system administration, web development, penetration
</I>&gt;<i> testing, and application security for both public and private organizations
</I>&gt;<i> servicing clients in the government and commercial spaces. His experience
</I>&gt;<i> includes performing web application security assessments, internal,
</I>&gt;<i> external, and physical penetration tests, source code reviews, social
</I>&gt;<i> engineering, and developer training. With over 5 years working directly
</I>&gt;<i> with information security and over 10 years programming experience, he has
</I>&gt;<i> a thorough web application security understanding from both developer and
</I>&gt;<i> attacker viewpoints. He has spoken at Defcon, the world&#8217;s largest hacker&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> convention, and has also been called on by organizations such as the FBI
</I>&gt;<i> and Secret Service as a subject matter expert. He is the technical editor
</I>&gt;<i> for the popular book, &quot;Metasploit The Penetration Tester's Guide&quot;.
