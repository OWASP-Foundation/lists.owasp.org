Hey,

I'm coming back into town for a few weeks sept 8th-19th and was  
wondering if anyone from the Phoenix OWASP wanted to meet up for a  
beer or two.  I know its been awhile since I've been back in the area  
and was hoping to reconnect with everyone out there.

I've got a couple side projects going on right now and I'd love to get  
some feedback from people in the community about them.

Let me know...

- Jon Rose

Valley wants to pool out to where ever we decide to meet let me know.

Jon  it would be be great to meet up!

 We need to turn OWASP Phx into a group or board run effort, anyway.

If we make it at Dos Gringos Trailer Park at 6 PM we can catch the last hour
of their awesome and el cheapo happy hour. TK has kind of sucked since the
new owners took it over.

Guys, are you referring to the Dos Gringos in Tempe on University?  I'd
be interested in doing some networking but I won't recognize any faces.

Joaquin

Joaquin, the DOS Gringos location Adam referred to, Trailer Park, is right
down by University, though it is on 8th street in Tempe.

http://www.dosgringosaz.com/trailer_park_contact.html or better yet
 
http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1001+E.+8th+St.+Tempe,+AZ+8
5281&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=60.417788,94.746094&ie=UTF8&ll=33.420441,-1
11.924162&spn=0.003954,0.005783&t=h&z=18.

As to recognizing anyone, if you look at the street view of DOS Gringos in
Google Maps, that's Adam with the umbrella.

Hey guys,

I'll be wearing a green-stripped white collared shirt and probably be  
close to the bar.

Hey,

It was great seeing everyone last night at Dos Gringos!  Awesome  
catching up with all the Phoenix OWASP members and talking about the  
latest and greatest happenings in security.  I'm headed back to DC  
soon, but hopefully more regular meetings can start again to bring  
everyone together.

- Jon
