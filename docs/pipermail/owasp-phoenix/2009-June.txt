Thanks to everyone who came out last night - I enjoyed sharing with you some
of what I've learned recently about the gray area where SEO, hacking, and
fraud intersect.

Scott is probably going to present next month on HTTP protocol hacking, a
really cool topic.

Andrew is going to present in August on how to use Microsoft's free
application threat modeling tools. The tools aren't only for Microsoft
languages - so this should be a fun talk!

Search Facebook for PHOENIX OWASP and join the party!

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collection/webappsec

Firefox now supports "collections," so I created a collection of the most
commonly used web app security testing add-ons.

If you add the "Add-On Collector" add-on (link on the page above), create a
Mozilla.org acct if you don't already have one, go to the Add-On window, and
enter your Mozilla.org account, it will let you subscribe to your favorite-d
"Collections," which will make adding a bunch of add-on's at once super
easy.

There are currently 16 plugins in this collection. If I missed anything...
let me know.

OWASP PCI Project :: Introduction and Call for Participation!

We are formally introducing the OWASP PCI Project to the Web
Application Security community! The industry needs a workspace for PCI
QSAs* and Application Security experts to work constructively together
- the OWASP PCI Project will serve as the platform in building
community consensus.

The PCI Project drives focused discussion and awareness, promoting a
thorough understanding of how to ensure safety in online payments.
Our mission is to:
+Make payment application security requirements achievable,
+QSA perspective and audit points accessible,
+A unified and mutually agreed upon approach to secure payment
applications, and sustainable compliance

The scope of this group will ultimately extend beyond PCI, becoming a
scalable software risk management framework for other regulations.  By
focusing on managing risk ? we are ensuring web sites, applications,
and web enabled software of any type are secured the right way (and
making compliance a natural and sustainable byproduct).

Now is the time to get involved!  Visit the project site and sign up!
 We are starting to build the project roadmap, we need YOUR help in
framing this project!
<https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-pci-project>

Proposed projects include:
+PCI Application Security Scoping Guidance,
+Application Security Development Guidance,
+PCI Application Security Auditor?s Playbooks,
+More to come!

Feel free to contact Trey Ford or Ed Bellis directly with any questions.

I'll add some that I'm missing - I didn't intend to replace or whatever the
Owasp Live CD, which is awesome btw. Just wanted to take advantage of the
new collections functionality. I love the Live CD, but I like having the
plugs in my day-to-day browser, too.

Phoenix Linux User Group Hackfests are 3 hour linux security labs from Noon
to 15:00 on
the second Saturday of every month.

[Come prepared to learn about a security tool and then start using it.]

Ethical, legal, social and historic aspects of computer security and
linux testing are covered as we safely investigate the strange world
of computer insecurity from our powerful Penguin perspectives in fine
OSI vantage layer up and down style.  Don't learn to hack; hack to
learn!

Network and other facilities generously provided by the Foundation for
Blind Children.
http://www.seeitourway.org/contactUs.html<http://www.seeitourway.org/contactUs.html>

The Foundation for Blind Children is located at 1224 Northern in Phoenix.
http://www.google.com/maps?q=1224+Northern,+Phoenix,+AZ%22
The entrance is via the North Door, (just follow the Desert Penguins
signs). Much thanks to Charles for all his assistance while at UAT and
now for volunteering his time and setting up the Foundation and PLUG
in symbiosis to make this training event a success.

Our June agenda is a loose lab for setting up equipment, answering
questions, and evaluating various computer security news items that
affect Linux, play with new tools together, while getting used to our
new facilities.  Feel free to bring your Notebooks, since initially we
will have only 3 desktops available for research.  Wireless is
available on our own isolated network, so we can be assured of
controlled festing and demonstrations.

All festers will sign our acceptable use agreement at the door which
protects the school and fellow festers while also establishing general
guidelines for contests and challenges during lab events.

Join us for a special Presentation NEXT Month (July) on
FreeIPA, an integrated security information management solution by
Presenter: Steven D Kaplan, MSCS, BSEE, CISSP of Waxman Associates, LLC

PLUG HackFests have an ongoing call for presentations.

August's HackFest Lab at the Foundation for Blind Children will be a
linux lab demonstration or PuppetFest Theatre.

We will have a one-ish hour of presentation, a puppet test lab
including a fully fleshed out securely setup puppet configuration and
at least two servers. This PuppetFest Theatre will show how easy it is
to pull strings to maintain configurations and standards in any server
farm comprising two or more systems.

Please see http://www.linuxgazette.com for my July "Linux Layer 8
Security" article for lab presentation materials.

Bring your recipes to wow us? Let's see what we can't make puppet do?

All PLUG events are full duplex, allowing for individual expansion and
enrichment as we follow our critical thought, rarely constrained by
anything but time.

"Don't learn to hack; hack to learn".

There is an open call for presentations and participants. Take the
black pill and leave forever the Security Matrix; HackFest with PLUG!

Location Clues: The Foundation for Blind Children, 1224 E. Northern in
Phoenix.  Entrance is via the North Door, follow the Desert Penguins
signs.

fines avoided and achieved huge optimizations in their processes ?
gains not strictly limited to computer security. He holds relevant
industry certifications, like the CISSP and IBM certifications for
Ethical Hacker and Security Consultant. Mr. Kaplan has done
significant amounts of software development to optimize his security
consulting effectiveness. This includes process automation, especially
related to collecting network security vulnerabilities, user ID
revalidation, and SOX compliance Some tools and programs are currently
in patent review.

Activities over the last 20 years cover both Federal Government (NSA)
INFOSEC experience and private sector work from all areas and
industries. Technological experience includes evaluation of Role Based
Access Control (RBAC) systems, Java software review (for
vulnerabilities), ethical hacking (EH) as well as design, evaluation,
certification and accreditation (C&A) of security architectures and
infrastructures. Evaluated systems and networks of varied
architectures, including service-oriented architecture (SOA) for
security vulnerabilities and legislative requirements compliance.

Audit experience includes review for compliance to Sarbanes-Oxley and
HIPAA regulations, and the development of specialized software tools
and scripts to expedite compliance.

FreeIPA Discussion Abstract
Over the years, as a security practitioner, I have had to support the
forward progress and integration of user identity management systems.
Usually this goes in fits and starts, as companies try to migrate to
their best guess as to the where their technology should be so that
they can be compliant with legislative and fiduciary requirements.

While I have had to work with proprietary solustions, I have been on
the look for an open source program that would meet or exceed what
(expensive) solutions I had to deal with. FreeIPA, while in its
infancy, threatens to become the 800 pound gorilla in this area, being
the vehicle to which most modern identity manange systems can
integrates.

FreeIPA is an integrated security information management solution
combining Linux (Fedora), Fedora Directory Server, MIT Kerberos, NTP,
DNS. It consists of a web interface and command-line administration
tools. Currently it supports identity management with plans to support
policy and auditing management. http://freeipa.org

Discussion Overview:

? Motivations, historical, experiential and legislative

? Basic principles, CIA, IAAA, and Identity Management

? What are features should a current IDM have? Does FreeIPA meet them?

? Current release information, demonstration, install issues

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Match.com Reveals Private Email Addresses from
	their Message Systems

Match.com Reveals Private Email Addresses from their Message Systems

Match.com, the popular paid online "secure" dating site, was found to
reveal private email addresses during messaging.

Email Reply headers in the Messages reading pane reveal the "outside"
email of the dating parties to each other. So my reading pane shows
clearly at the top of an email Match.com "Message" thread:</p>

Date: Wed, 24 Jun 2009 23:18:23 -0500
From: obnosis at talkmatch.com
To: {snip}@hotmail.com
Subject: Match.com Message: RE: Itsadate


So, I "obnosis at talkmatch" (obfuscated email Match.com only email
address) would immediately know that a man identified only by his
Match.com screen name, was really "{snip}@hotmail.com". And
alternately he would also be able to see my outside email address in
his Messages reading pane.

While at the same time, the bottom of the email Match.com "Message"
thread their application tacks on a nice DISCLAIMER:

------start------
Important tips: Protect your privacy

Our email system strips away your real email address so that the
recipient will NOT see it in the
From: line; however, you must...
? Remove any mention of your email address from the body of your message.
? Remove or turn off any automatic signature at the end of your email.
? Avoid using Cc: or Bcc: to help protect your identity.
If you receive an email that you find offensive or contains
advertisements for products or services other than Match.com, please
forward the message immediately to abuse at cc.match.com.
If you no longer wish to receive communication from this person you
can block this user from further contact here.


DISCLAIMER
Match.com does not screen private email between members, nor are we
liable for the content of these messages. All members are bound by the
Match.com Service Agreement.

---end----

Is Match.com using security only for cheap marketing ("if you don't
use our site, Mister Stranger Danger will get your identity"), while
also ignoring REAL security at a application level?

There are NO SECURITY options that can be set on Match.com, to allow
display of personal information, BTW!

Match.com was informed on June 25, 2009 with screenshots. They have
yet to respond to this serious security breech!

Hello all,

As a point of clarity I am not slated to be presenting on threat modeling
until the August meeting.  I am not sure who or what is slated for this
upcoming July meeting.
