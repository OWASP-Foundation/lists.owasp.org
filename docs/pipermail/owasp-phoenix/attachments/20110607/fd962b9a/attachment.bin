DESCRIPTION:OWASP Phoenix invites you to it's June meeting!    \n\nTwo spea
 kers this month.\n\n \n\nTuesday June 7th 2011 6:30 - 7:30 PM at University
  of Advancing Technology. The meetings are always free\, unfortunately the 
 drinks aren't.\n\nUniversity of Advancing Technology 2625 W. BASELINE RD. T
 EMPE\, AZ 85283\n\n \n\nObfuscating Search Queries with Hayst.ac\n\nDavid H
 uerta\n\n \n\nHayst.ac\, is a browser userscript to obfuscate search querie
 s with machine-generated queries with the goal to be as close to indistingu
 ishable from the human generated ones as possible. This is ultimately to di
 scourage the use of search histories as a source of user profiling.\n\n \n\
 nBio:\n\nAfter arriving in Arizona from the posh\, cosmopolitan enclave of 
 southeastern Idaho\, David founded the DeVry Linux User Group (DeLUG) in 20
 03\, an originally student organization that drew members and activities fr
 om the greater West Valley Free software community\, including students at 
 GCC and ASU West.  He also serves on the board of directors for HeatSync La
 bs\, a hackerspace in Chandler.\n\n \n\n \n\nOWASP O2 Platform\n\nDinis Cru
 z\n\n \n\n \n\nThe O2 Platform is focused on automating application securit
 y knowledge and workflows. It is specifically designed for developers and s
 ecurity consultants to be able to perform quick\, effective and thorough so
 urce code-driven application security reviews (blackbox + whitebox). In add
 ition to the manual findings created/discovered by security consultants\, t
 he OWASP O2 Platform allows the easy consumption of results from multiple O
 WASP  projects and commercial scanning tools. This allows security consulta
 nts to find\, exploit and automate (via Unit Tests) security vulnerabilitie
 s usually dismissed by the community as impossible to find/recreate. More i
 mportantly\, it provides security consultants a mechanism to: (a) "talk" wi
 th developers (via UnitTest)\,  (b) give developers a way to replicate + "c
 heck if it's fixed" the vulnerabilities reported and (c) engage in a two-wa
 y conversion on the best way to fix/remediate those vulnerabilities. For mo
 re details see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_O2_Platform\, to downl

 t\n\n \n\nBio\n\nDinis Cruz is a Security Consultant based in London (UK) a
 nd specialized in: ASP.NET/J2EE Application Security\, Application Security
  audits and .NET Security Curriculum Development.\n\nFor the past couple ye
 ars Dinis has focused on the field of Static Source Code Analysis and Dynam
 ic Website Assessments (aka penetration testing)\, and is the main develope
 r of the OWASP O2 Platform which is an Open Source project that is focused 
 on 'Automating Security Consultants Knowledge/Workflows' and 'Allowing non-
 security experts to access and consume Security Knowledge'. Dinis is curren
 tly focused on making the O2 Platform the industry standard for consuming\,
  instrumenting and data-sharing between: the multiple WebAppSec tools\, the
  Security consultants and the final users (from management to developers).\
