<PRE>Join the PLUG Hackfesters for Puppet Theatre next Saturday @10:00AM!

We will be swiftly going through the presentation materials published
this month on the LinuxGazette:
<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/165/kachold.html">http://linuxgazette.net/165/kachold.html</A>
followed by a hands on session to three systems setup for the event.
Bring your recipes!

Our network model this time will be both wireless and wired, so that
we can continue both a FLAG event and our Puppet presentation/lab.

Our guest, Dennis Kibbe, well known for his long contribution to the
PLUG InstallFests and adjunct teacher with Mesa Community College,
will be appearing as a FLAG (good luck to one and all)!

Session closes at 13:00 this time, in our earlier time slot.

Our volunteers will also be attempting to:

1) Build yet another Accessibility Linux System for testing by the
Foundation's students.
2) Provide USB-CD/DVD media build station and services for BT4/Ubuntu/DVL/Samari

Watch for the Backtrack4 LinuxGazette September materials which will
be our next HackFest lab subject.

&lt;goodie goodie goodie!&gt;

A disclaimer signature is required for admittance, which states you
agree to only attack clearly designated FLAGs, announce any and all
flags, and swiftly report any security threats you might encounter to
the Foundation for Blind Children staff.

Any and all failing to follow these Security Lab Acceptable Use
Guidelines, will be honeypot trapped, logged and reported everywhere
possible through the Foundation's extensive resources.

IDS experts, honeypot builders and network forensics volunteers please
contact me off list.

See you there!
