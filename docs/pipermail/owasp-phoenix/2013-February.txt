 Using ThreadFix To Manage Application Vulnerabilities

Dan Cornell, Denim Group


ThreadFix is an open source software vulnerability aggregation and
management system that reduces the time it takes to fix software
vulnerabilities. It imports the results from dynamic, static and manual
testing to provide a centralized view of software security defects across
development teams and applications. The system allows organizations to
correlate testing results and streamline software remediation efforts by
simplifying feeds to software issue trackers. This presentation will walk
through the major functionality in ThreadFix and describe several common
use cases such as merging the results of multiple open source and
commercial scanning tools and services. It will also demonstrate how
ThreadFix can be used to track the results of scanning over time and gauge
the effectiveness of different scanning techniques and technologies.
Finally it will provide examples of how tracking assurance activities
across an organization?s application portfolio can help the organization
optimize remediation activities to best address risks associated with
vulnerable software.

Dan Cornell has over twelve years of experience architecting and developing
web-based software systems. He leads Denim Group's security research team
in investigating the application of secure coding and development
techniques to improve web-based software development methodologies.



Dan was the founding coordinator and chairman for the Java Users Group of
San Antonio (JUGSA) and currently serves as the OWASP San Antonio chapter
leader, member of the OWASP Global Membership Committee and co-lead of the
OWASP Open Review Project. Dan has spoken at such international conferences
as ROOTs in Norway and OWASP EU Summit in Portugal.

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Information Security Analyst position open @ Axway
Message-ID: <1B39360939CD854B8165F598EE1B17481DADBB8C@WPHXMAIL1.phx.axway.int>

I've been working for Axway for several years now and it's been both challenging and rewarding. Overall, a great place to work. Axway has a couple different security teams globally. I work on the Product/R&D side, however, the operations side has a position open that just came available.

I cannot help you get to the head of the line, so please use the links provided if you're interested. I don't want to clutter the OWASP email list, so I'd discourage reply-all type discussions.
