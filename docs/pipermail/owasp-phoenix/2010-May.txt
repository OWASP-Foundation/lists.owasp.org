Message-ID: <l2p9dbb46901005040915z9e0b4e86yd4c1ea397d4c7545@mail.gmail.com>

Just wanted to send out a quick reminder that we are meeting tonight!  We
are planning on starting off in room 208, but if it becomes too full we will
migrate to 206-7 at 7:00.  Hope to see you tonight!

Redefining & Understanding Security Posture"* *Andrew Wilson*, (me)


One of the unfortunate realities of any industry is buzzword bingo. We often
take terms and throw them around because they sound cool, but generally
without any actual or well understood meaning. Security posture is one of
those terms, that while rather popular, isn't really used in a well defined
and functional fashion

This presentation will help better outline:

   - What is posture & why is it important
   - How can be used to gain advantage, how can it be used against people
   - How does that have valuable meaning as it relates to the security
   industry.


The meeting will be held at:

6:30 PM - 7:30 PM, for about 1 hour
University of Advancing Technology 2625 W. BASELINE RD. TEMPE, AZ 85283-1056


Drinks will be found afterword at Doc & Eddies.

Doc & Eddy's, 909 East Minton Drive, Tempe, AZ 85282-7021

Andrew:

Do you have an online bio, summary and presentation somewhere?
Are you streaming this for on-call slaves, etc.?

Thanks

Lisa,

Great questions!  I do not have a formal online bio, the closest one I have
is on my blog @ http://pinvoke.wordpress.com/about/ My professional
experience is also listed @ http://www.linkedin.com/in/awilsonaz

This presentation won't be published online for a little while due to some
other conflicts, though I'd like to get it out to the group at some point.
In general most presentations should be listed on our phoenix chapter site
on the OWASP website.

Lastly, as far as I know we've never had a demand to open up a dialin or
webinar of the meeting.  I am not opposed to it, as long as there is enough
interest.  If anyone is interested in something like that, please email me
off the list and I will look into streaming / recording the presentations
live.

Thanks,

-Andrew

Arizona State University holds monthly training for its web developers. We would like to invite someone to speak to us about your choice of the following topics (one or more as you prefer):

1)      How to protect against SQL injection attacks.

2)      How to protect against cross-site scripting, injection and session riding.

3)      HTTP response splitting.

4)      Best web security practices using Javascript.

5)      How to secure Flash objects and Java applets.

6)      Securing XML libraries.

7)      Secure code from scanning software to acquire information from online websites.

8)      The inside scoop on what an auditor or hacker does and how they attempt to break the applications.

The next dates that are available are June 2 or July 7 from 3:30 - 5pm at the ASU Tempe Campus. I'm pretty sure we can reimburse your parking but beyond that about all we can offer is our undying gratitude! :)

If interested, reply to me and I'll coordinate the details with you off list. Thank you in advance.

I applaud such an effort. I'm no longer in Phoenix (a former chapter
leader of OWASP), but you will find some good resources from this
group!

> 1)      How to protect against SQL injection attacks.
"SQL Injection Attacks" book by Justin Clarke.

> 2)      How to protect against cross-site scripting, injection and session riding.
"Seven Deadliest Web Attacks" book by Mike Shema (First chapter on XSS)

> 3)      HTTP response splitting.
We call this "HTTP Header Injection" now. The tool, Burp Suite
Professional is very good at finding these types of vulnerabilities
and only costs 165 British Pounds (GBP)

> 4)      Best web security practices using Javascript.
"Web 2.0 Security: Defending Ajax, RIA, and SOA" book by Shreeraj Shah
(a bit outdated and there are few upcoming books that will cover this.
I also suggest "Hacking Exposed Web 2.0" perhaps)

> 5)      How to secure Flash objects and Java applets.
"Web Application Hacker's Handbook" by Dafydd Stuttard; Marcus Pinto
-- this book also covers the HTTP Header Injection issues above
nicely, as well ;> One of my personal favorites!

> 6)      Securing XML libraries.
I'm not exactly sure about this question (what do you mean by
"securing XML libraries"?), but "Hunting Security Bugs" from Microsoft
Press covers a lot of XML security issues in-depth (as does the "Web
2.0 Security" books above

> 7)      Secure code from scanning software to acquire information from online websites.
"Secure Programming with Static Analysis" by Brain Chess and Jacob West

> 8)      The inside scoop on what an auditor or hacker does and how they attempt to break the applications.

You'll have to ask me. "Auditor" is an incorrect word (and so is
"hacker"). Most people refer to these best as "application security
consultants" or "appsec consultants".

I prefer to use the terminology "application assessment" or "app
assessment" instead of "source code audit" or "penetration-test" or
"ethical hacking".

Good appsec consultants will perform threat-modeling (see the
Microsoft book with the same name) in order to provide adversarial
security testing. This involves using a tool such as Burp Suite
Professional (mentioned above) to walk the web app. After a walk,
"insertion points" are identified, which usually consist of URLs,
parameters, forms, queries, cookies, and HTTP headers. Some "insertion
points" need to be identified separately by using a web browser (note:
Burp Pro requires a web browser, so you're already using one) and
downloading Javascript or SWF files.

After using the web browser and Burp Suite Professional to identify
insertion points, a good appsec consultant will map the URLs to source
code through a process known as "code traversal". This requires deep
knowledge of the target application, its source code architecture,
internal code flow, and the ability to perform both "data flow
analysis" and "code flow analysis". I use two tools to do this: 1)
Source Insight, which is a code editor/viewer, and 2) OWASP
CodeCrawler, another code viewer that requires Visual Studio
Professional 2008. Source Insight is just over 200 US dollars
(although a 30-day trial is downloadable for free) and Visual Studio
Professional 2008 can be had for as little as 70 US dollars
(especially now that Visual Studio Professional 2010 is available).

It is required to have lots of books available in order to understand
all of the code intricacies -- I suggest subscriptions to
SafariBooksOnline, Books24x7, Kindle for PC, and Google Books (Google
Editions Book Store will be out soon, as well).

I might be available to come visit during those times. Perhaps Andrew
or Pete (the current OWASP chapter leaders) can look into
accommodating me through the OWASP chapter visit program?

Thanks and Good luck,
Andre

I propose adding Jarlsberg: Google?s web application training - http://jarlsberg.appspot.com/part1/  to http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix/Tools#Test_sites_.2F_testing_grounds 

 

Jarlsberg: Google?s new web application training

Google is offering Jarlsberg /y?rlz'?b?rg/, "a small, cheesy web application that allows its users to publish snippets of text and store assorted files ... Jarlsberg has multiple security bugs ranging from cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery, to information disclosure, denial of service, and remote code execution. The goal of this codelab is to guide you through discovering some of these bugs and learning ways to fix them both in Jarlsberg and in general." The training is located here: http://jarlsberg.appspot.com/part1 <http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjarlsberg%2Eappspot%2Ecom%2Fpart1&urlhash=RCcM>

It sounds similar to the OWASP Broken Web Apps tool. Comments anyone?

Walter,

You don't propose changes to that page. You sign up for an account,
you login, you edit the page, and add what you want to it.

However, I think that OWASP Phoenix Tool page is rather out-of-date.
Even my blog, http://tssci-security.com which covered tools after that
project is very seriously out of date.

The best resource today is http://tools.securitytube.net
It's rather new, but it has up-to-date information. Another source
might be http://pentestit.com but I don't like that project because
it's rather disorganized. There used to be other great sites like
http://indianz.ch but I don't know what happened to their content...

Cheers,
Andre

Andre:
I am an OWASP DC member and I actually considered editing the page and then decided that to do so might be considered rude.  

My team is supporting the DHS Software Assurance Program managed by Joe Jarzombek.  We are interested in linking to timely and accurate inform from the page https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/swa/swa_tools.html  We will look at and add links to the sites you suggest below. 

As we do not maintain those other sites, http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix/Tools#Test_sites_.2F_testing_grounds could be available posting updates we become aware of.   

Thanks, Walt

All,

Sorry for the delayed response, it's been such a crazy month!  We have the
honor of getting Rich Mogul from Securosis back to speak with us this
month.  If you can attend, this is going to be a GREAT presentation.

Details

Tuesday June 1st 2010 6:30 - 7:30 PM at University of Advancing Technology

Involuntary Case Studies in Data Breaches, Rich Mogull, Securosis

It's absolutely bass ackwards, but while the bad guys constantly share
details of their exploits, including techniques, when it comes to real
incidents, actual defenders rarely talk about what worked, and what didn't.
Our entire industry is built on anecdote and the few tidbits we can glean
from press reports. Thus we, as an industry, don't link means and methods to
actual security outcomes. Without this information we're like a bunch of
blindfolded wannabe ninjas trying to catch rounds from a machine gun with
our bare hands. In this session we'll name names as we build in-depth case
studies based on publicly available information, some of which isn't overly
public. We will combine these with the latest information from breach
reports released by incident response companies and the Dataloss Database.
The session will build a picture of how real breaches happen, which security
controls really work, and which compliance checkboxes are a complete and
total waste of time.

Drinks will be found afterword at Doc & Eddies.

Doc & Eddy's, 909 East Minton Drive, Tempe, AZ 85282-7021
