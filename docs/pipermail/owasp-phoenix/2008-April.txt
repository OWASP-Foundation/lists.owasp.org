It's lonely at the top! :)

As you all know - our chapter has been hit or miss. Mostly miss lately! I
have been just too busy for what is a time consuming task to get meetings
scheduled and speakers invited, all by my lonesome.

I am willing to step down as chapter lead and move to more of a
collaborative board leadership format.

I intend to continue being involved with running the chapter, but I think it
will work better if we have more participation.

Let me know if you're interested in participating in running the chapter and
helping it become the forum I know it can be!

Once I get enough viable responses, I'll schedule a get-together (someplace
that serves adult beverages of course - maybe George and Dragon inb PHZ?)
and we will plot the plans for the future of the chapter, together.
