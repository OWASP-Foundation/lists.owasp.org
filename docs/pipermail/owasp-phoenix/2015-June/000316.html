<PRE>Dear *Owasp-phoenix Subscribers,*

I'm excited to announce the second Phoenix OWASP chapter meeting, which
will be held at UAT (Room #136) on Tuesday, June 09, 2015.  Our meeting
last month had about 35 attendees, which was a great turnout for our first
meeting in a while.

Details have been posted to the Chapter Page:

Title: *If you like it then you shouldn&#8217;t put a ring3 on it*
Presenter: *Andrew Wilson*
Web applications are a primary means to breaching a company&#8217;s external
network. It is a high-value goal for both malicious actors and security
professionals to gain this valuable foothold. But how do you get from mere
web application vulnerabilities to the compromise of a server? Common
testing guidelines provide you a check list of items to test for, but very
few show you how to utilize vulnerabilities to achieve testing goals.

Everyone knows that vulnerabilities have different levels of risk; But,
what few talk about is the utility provided by vulnerabilities and how they
can be used to achieve goals. Although some vulnerabilities are useful to
note and impactful to a client, during a time gaped and scoped engagement
they may not be able to be fully utilized. However, there are a handful of
key direct vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to result in a compromise.
These vulnerabilities, along with how to find them and how to leverage them
for our needs, will be reviewed during this talk. Additionally, common
attack strategies will be reviewed that can help a focus time and energies
to maximize efforts in web server compromises.
