Dear *Owasp-phoenix Subscribers,*

I'm excited to announce the second Phoenix OWASP chapter meeting, which
will be held at UAT (Room #136) on Tuesday, June 09, 2015.  Our meeting
last month had about 35 attendees, which was a great turnout for our first
meeting in a while.

Title: *If you like it then you shouldn?t put a ring3 on it*
Presenter: *Andrew Wilson*
Web applications are a primary means to breaching a company?s external
network. It is a high-value goal for both malicious actors and security
professionals to gain this valuable foothold. But how do you get from mere
web application vulnerabilities to the compromise of a server? Common
testing guidelines provide you a check list of items to test for, but very
few show you how to utilize vulnerabilities to achieve testing goals.

Everyone knows that vulnerabilities have different levels of risk; But,
what few talk about is the utility provided by vulnerabilities and how they
can be used to achieve goals. Although some vulnerabilities are useful to
note and impactful to a client, during a time gaped and scoped engagement
they may not be able to be fully utilized. However, there are a handful of
key direct vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to result in a compromise.
These vulnerabilities, along with how to find them and how to leverage them
for our needs, will be reviewed during this talk. Additionally, common
attack strategies will be reviewed that can help a focus time and energies
to maximize efforts in web server compromises.

I?m out of town at a tech conference, and won?t be able to make the meeting. Any chance there will be a video of the presentation posted that I could watch after? It looks like a good presentation. 

Cheers,

Dear *Owasp-phoenix Subscribers,*

I'm excited to announce the third Phoenix OWASP chapter meeting, which will
be held at UAT (Room #136) on Tuesday, July 07, 2015.  Notably, no
recording of any kind is allowed, because the presenters will be presenting
this talk at the DefCon Security Conference in Vegas soon.

If you use Meetup.com, please RSVP so that I know how many potential
attendees we might have.  http://www.meetup.com/owasp-phoenix

Details have been posted to the Chapter Page:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix

Tuesday, July 07
Time: 6:30 - 7:30 Location: UAT (University of Advancing Technology) 2625 W
Baseline Rd, Tempe, AZ 85283
Room: 136 (*auditorium*)
Title: *Hacking Smart Safes: On the "Brink" of a Robbery*
Presenter(s): *Dan ?AltF4? Petro, Oscar Salazar*
Have you ever wanted to crack open a safe full of cash with nothing but a
USB stick? Now you can! The Brink?s CompuSafe cash management product line
provides a ?smart safe as a service? solution to major retailers and fast
food franchises. They offer end-to-end management of your cash,
transporting it safely from your storefront safe to your bank via armored
car.
During this talk, we?ll uncover a major flaw in the Brink?s CompuSafe and
demonstrate how to crack one open in seconds flat. All you need is a USB
stick and a large bag to hold all of the cash. We?ll discuss how to
remotely takeover the safe with full administrator privileges, and show how
to enumerate a target list of other major Brink?s CompuSafe customers
(exposed via configuration files stored right on the safe).
At any given time, up to $240,000 can be sitting in each of the 14,000
Brink?s CompuSafe smart safes currently deployed across the United States -
potentially billions of dollars just waiting to be stolen.
We will also release a USB Rubber Ducky script to automate the whole
attack, acting as a skeleton key that can open any Brink?s safe. Plug and
plunder!
So come ready to engage us as we explore these tools and more in this DEMO
rich presentation. And don?t forget to call Kenny Loggins? because this
presentation is your highway to the Danger Zone?
