OWASP Phoenix invites you to it's July event.
*Tuesday July 5th 6:30pm
*

In celebration of independence, we've decided the most rational course of
action is beer.
For July please join us at Papago Brewing for a casual get together. No
presentations, no sales pitches, just good conversation and beer.
