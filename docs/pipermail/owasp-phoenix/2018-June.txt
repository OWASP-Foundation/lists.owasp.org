We have an amazing guest speaker coming in from out of town. He's a pioneer in Mobile and IOT pentesting, so it'll be a real treat for our community to have him present. Please be sure to RSVP on Meetup.com/owasp-phoenix

Practical IoT Exploitation ? How to get started in IoT Pentesting

In this session, attendees will gain an in-depth understanding of the security vulnerabilities in the Internet of Things devices around us, how they can find vulnerabilities and exploit them. If you have never done IoT Exploitation or penetration testing of IoT devices earlier, this talk will help you get started. 

We will be mostly focusing on Smart Home devices, but the techniques would apply to pretty much any IoT device that you will encounter. 

Some of the topics that we will look at are: 

1.      Exploiting Communication protocols 
2.      Hardware hacking for IoT devices 
3.      Firmware RE techniques and Exploitation 

The talk contains both live demonstrations exploiting IoT components and would also share insights on the methodology to be used in order to perform pentesting of IoT devices.
