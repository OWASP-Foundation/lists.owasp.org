Dear *Owasp-phoenix Subscribers,*


AppSec Enthusiasts - for those of you not using Meetup, our next OWASP
Phoenix chapter meeting will be held at ASU this Wednesday, October 05.
Raymond Tu, Ph.D Student, will be presenting "Everyone hates Robocalls: Why
is it so hard to stop?"

http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Phoenix/events/234095831/

Free pizza will be provided shortly before the presentation. Please arrive
15-30 minutes early to facilitate the badging process; a valid picture ID
is required.

If you use Meetup.com <http://meetup.com>, please RSVP so that I know how
many potential attendees we might have.  http://www.meetup.com/owasp-phoenix
