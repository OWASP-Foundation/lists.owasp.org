Abstract:
Sweet Pickles is inspired by a talk presented at Blackhat by Marco Salverio
about practical pickle exploitation. Sweet pickles aims to address some of
the concerns presented by Marco in his Sour Pickles talk. Using strong
cryptography methods Sweet Pickles attempts to address the problem of
confidentiality and authenticity of a python pickle while in transit. Sweet
pickles utilizes Advaced Encryption Standard(AES) and Elliptic Curve
Cryptography(ECC) to help secure Python's Serialized Objects(Pickles).
Sweet pickles was first presented at the International Cyber Defense

will be an elaboration on the research Chase has done on python pickles and
his work to secure them.
