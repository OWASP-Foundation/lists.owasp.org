Hi guys,

Not sure if anyone can see this. Never really participated in an email
mailing list before.

I live up in the Prescott area and am just wondering how I might be able to
participate or get involved in OWASP. Closest "chapter" for me is Phoenix,
obviously, but that's about 2 hours south of where I'm at.

Is there a website for the OWASP Phoenix Chapter with a forum, recordings,
etc? Or do you guys need one to be set up?

I'm also a web developer and have recently taken up security research as
time permits. I've presented in a recent conference our custom in-house
implementation of a WAF and have also been working on security challenges
at overthewire.org for some time just to learn and try out things. Also
possibly going to be taking SEC504
<https://www.sans.org/course/hacker-techniques-exploits-incident-handling>
with SANS in the upcoming months for more training.

Let me know. Thanks!

Matt
