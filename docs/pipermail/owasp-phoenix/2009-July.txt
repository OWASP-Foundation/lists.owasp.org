Hello all,

As a point of clarity I am not slated to be presenting on threat modeling until the August meeting.  I am not sure who or what is slated for this upcoming July meeting.

Scott White, penetration Tester from Secure State, will give a tutorial on
Advanced SQL Injection techniques. Expect to learn how hackers
systematically attack databases and underlying operating systems using
nothing but a web browser as their attack tool.

the West side of the building. Look for the suite number on the door.

It's only $50 a year and all the money goes to owasp.org, a not-for-profit
501c3.

I finally just became an official member, hey better late than never.

So if you feel like OWASP.org and all the projects it hosts might be worth
$50 a year to you, you know what to do.

There are a LOT of really cool OWASP projects.

If there are any you're really into and would like to get involved with, one
good way is to join the associated project mailing list.

Here is a list of all the chapters and projects, and their mailing lists.

Thanks for the presentation, Scott. It was very well done, starting off with a basic SQL background without -lingering too much and moving on to advanced techniques with practical examples. Your presentation re-motivated me to dig into and learn more about SQL injection attacks.

Thanks again for sharing with us.

I agree, it was a good overview of the "wrong way" to setup a MS SQL server
(just like a great many out there) and fail to sanitize code.

Of course, you managed to pack a good deal into 1 hour, and it was
completely graspable.

Thanks!

Check out the PLUG HackFest this Saturday, the 11th of July at the
Foundation for Blind Children on FreeIPA, Noon until 3PM.

http://plug.phoenix.az.us/node/658

Next Month August is Puppet Theatre lab; bring your recipes!

Also: Special Installfest guest Dennis Kibbee (Mesa Community College
Adjunct teacher) appears as a FLAG!
We are going to have systems setup to quickly make Ubuntu/Knoppix
Pendrives, so bring your keys during this August lab.  PLUG donates
their time to the Foundation for Blind Children to build networks and

I agree, it was a good overview of the "wrong way" to setup a MS SQL
server (just like a great many out there) and fail to sanitize code.

Of course, you managed to pack a good deal into 1 hour, and it was
fairly fun to come out of the "security matrix".

Too bad we can't candidly tell stories of the exploits we have seen?

Thanks again!

8/08/2009 10:00AM - 1:00PM

August's HackFest Lab at the Foundation for Blind Children will center
around puppet.

We will have a one-ish hour of presentation, a puppet test lab
including a fully fleshed out securely setup puppet.
We will take some fest time to show how easy it is to pull strings,
maintain configurations and standards in any network comprising two or
more systems.

Please see http://www.linuxgazette.com July "Layer 8 Linux Security"
article for the lab presentation materials.

Bring your recipes to wow us, since all PLUG events are full duplex,
allowing for individual expansion and enrichment as we follow our
critical thought, rarely constrained by anything but time.

Dennis Kibbe Adjunct Faculty at Mesa Community College, and regular
"iconic" figure at the local InstallFests will be our Special Guest
FLAG, appearing with his exceedingly clean, carefully configured and
sticker decorated laptop, in immaculate geek shirt.
Following our acceptable use guidelines (to announce any and every
flag), you can social engineer, attempt to exploit services, and/or do
anything else you might think of to this FLAG during our 3 hour Puppet
theatre session.

including a fully fleshed out securely setup puppet.

We will take some fest time to show how easy it is to pull strings,

systems in a hurry.

Please see http://www.linuxgazette.com July "Layer 8 Linux Security"

Bring your puppet recipes to wow us.
All PLUG events are full duplex,allowing for individual expansion

anything other than setup time.

Dennis Kibbe, Adjunct Faculty at Mesa Community College, and regular
"iconic" figure at the PLUG InstallFests will be our Special Guest
FLAG, appearing with his exceedingly clean, carefully configured and
sticker decorated laptop (on it's own network), in immaculate geek shirt,
daring anyone to successfully encroach his linux.  Dennis will give us a short
description of his linux system build at the end of the August lab.

Following PLUG HackFest acceptable use guidelines (to announce any and every
flag), you can social engineer, attempt to exploit services, and/or do
anything else you can get away with to take this FLAG during our 3 hour
"Puppet Theatre" session.  Accolades and prizes will be available for
any success.

We will have the disk burner setup (this time using local disk [rather
than USB - which
was timing out and causing corrupted burns in July]) and be able to
make persistent
pendrives on the spot in Knoppix, BackTrack4 persistent or Ubuntu.
Bring your media.

Again, we will be taking a stab at lock picking with a table with
tools and locks setup
to ensure everyone can easily master these simple fun skills.

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Question second time
Message-ID: <4A5E1D53.5090701@paysonindex.com>

Please excuse me if you have already received this.  I posted it to the 
other side of the list I think.

I have been on the Owasp list for quite some time no but haven't had the 
opportunity to attend the meetings as I live in Payson and it is 
difficult for me to get to the valley.  I have a question that will 
prove simple to some of you on the list so I would really appreciate 
your help.

I am not sure this is where I should post this but if it is 
inappropriate please let me know.

An acquaintance who develops web pages in DreamWeaver has a client who 
is getting regular attacks from someone who is seeding a virus to his 
index.html page.

My questions  to you are:

1)   How is that possible unless he has access to the ftp connection?

2)   How can it be stopped?

I am sure you will have questions that I will need to get answers to so 
I will say thanks in advance for any help you might be able to give.

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Meterpreter
Message-ID: <d4e0a6fd0907191544u60dfb9fdn3f88f24993892d8c@mail.gmail.com>

Researchers will release an open source tool at Black Hat USA that
helps forensics investigators reconstruct attacks that use a popular
Metasploit payload to covers its tracks.

Mandiant's Steve Davis and Peter Silberman have developed what might
be called an anti-anti-forensics tool, dubbed the Metasploit Forensics
Framework, which they'll demonstrate at Black Hat 2009.

The tool is aimed at unmasking what Metasploit's stealthy Meterpreter
did on a machine. Meterpreter lets developers write code in DLL files
and execute everything in memory -- without writing anything to the
victim machine's disk, where it could be detected and, in turn,
complicate incident response.

Meterpreter will download and upload files, execute code, and open its
own command shell and report if a Meterpreter packet is still in
memory, and, if so, tell us which files Meterpreter has accessed, and
whether it has modified a registry key (for m$).

Some traditional antivirus tools can't detect Meterpreter-borne
attacks because they never hit the disk. Meterpreter can reconstruct a
crime scene from memory.

The Metasploit Forensics Framework is a proof-of-concept tool that
scans the processes in memory.

Meterpreter has unique packets that can be identified to reconstruct
Metasploit processes. Peter Silberman, an engineer on the product team
at Mandiant, announced that Meterpreter will be demonstrated at Black
Hat: "We're going to discuss how Meterpreter looks in memory, and how
it's able to circumvent traditional tools. We'll demonstrate how with
some advanced knowledge, you can reconstruct what commands were sent
to Meterpreter and perform an autopsy on an attack."

Memory analysis in forensics is recently catching up.  Meterpreter
helps investigators pull useful information to determine how freed
memory still provides useful information on the commands an attacker
used.

It's fully expected that Metasploit developers will come up with a
workaround for Meterpreter.  Meterpreter will be available on
Mandiant's website the day of their Black Hat presentation so everyone
can begin to experiment with it.
