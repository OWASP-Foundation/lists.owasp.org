Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] July OWASP Phoenix Meeting, Tuesday the 3rd
Message-ID: <CAANLsN92fqVp4ikwbpermRMr0xxBgw88pOniEWRC+md_nJWEfg@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Looking forward to see you all on Tuesday, 6:30PM & UAT.  Details below:

*Not the end of XSS*
*
*

XSS is by no means a solved problem. There is no silver bullet, function
call or technology that makes

you absolutely immune. This talk is focusing on bypassing Anti-XSS filters
found in browsers as well

as bypassing Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. This talk covers
how these technologies are

used to protect a web application and how they can be abused by an attacker.


*Michael Brooks*

Michael Brooks was in the top 1% of earners in the Google bug bounty
program. He has written

exploits for software you have probably used, patches have been written and
we are all safer for it. A

perfectly secure system can never be accomplished, test everything, trust
nothing.


Please expect this next month's meeting to go a small bit longer as we
going to have some chapter updates initially.

-Andrew

-- 
We are so dazzled by the speed and expanding applications of technology
that we begin to think it is an adequate substitute for what it replaces. -
Peter Block

Message-ID: <CAANLsN9sdDDYO7oN30UrfEwwR6LQzxxxyasnhNSsuxvSwvj8Rw@mail.gmail.com>

OWASP Phoenix invites you to it's August meeting!

Tuesday August 7th  6:30 - 7:30 PM

University of Advancing Technology 2625 W. BASELINE RD. TEMPE, AZ 85283

The meetings are always free, unfortunately the drinks after aren't.

*Defcon Panel Talk*

Every year Defcon some of the greatest talks in the industry, Defcon 20 was
no exception.  However, even though thousands show up, not everyone gets a
chance to go.  This upcoming OWASP is going to feature a panel of locals
who attended Defcon.  They will be reviewing some of the talks the saw and
things they did.  For those who couldn't make it out to Vegas-- this is a
great chance to learn about some new things released this year.


If you attended and would be willing to participate, please let me know
(privately) and I will get you slated for a few minutes to talk.
