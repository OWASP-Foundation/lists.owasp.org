<PRE>Firstly, I apologize if my post came off as an attack. Just wanted to  
present the other side of the argument - that the GIAC SSP exams have  
some decent content.

By the way, I am the technical editor of the second one, but it is by  
no means my book - it belongs to Barry and WROX.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Second, to Andre, I don't think you're giving the GIAC SSP stuff a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fair shake. To be fair, I helped write a few of the questions and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Java GIAC SSP certification. I have very little reason to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> biased though - I thought the Java exam was ridiculously bad (which  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> why I complained and got asked to help with .NET) and I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particularly care if the certification succeeds or fails.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're working on something, but you don't care if it fails? Sounds
</I>&gt;<i> like you're really seriously dedicated to quality. Or perhaps the
</I>&gt;<i> monetary or brand-recognition factors weigh heavily enough to consider
</I>&gt;<i> wasting your time on such a project? Feel free to explain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In terms of the GIAC .NET exam, I can only help as much as they ask me  
to. I can't really vouch for the whole thing, since it's not my baby.  
I think my questions are good though :)

&gt;<i> I have not taken the GIAC exams, but I have seen the SANS training
</I>&gt;<i> that goes along with them. Would it be presumptuous to think that the
</I>&gt;<i> exam content is based on the training?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>They have training that they offer that is based off the exam, I  
believe. The exam content itself seems to be based off of whatever the  
people who write the exam feel like testing.

&gt;<i> BTW, I'm speaking for Java, C, and .NET (all three).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The .NET exam is fairly well-rounded and talks about a lot of real
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world ASP.NET security issues, including recent technologies like  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LINQ
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and AntiXSS. Is it perfect? Definitely not. I think that good exams
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are a lot harder to write than people realize.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't the problem with software security that people ship software
</I>&gt;<i> blindly, without quality or security built-in? What kind of message
</I>&gt;<i> does it send when an educator ships certification and training when
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;no or little&quot; thought goes into the outcomes and value-to-customer?
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't this the *exact* type of thinking we're trying to curtail?
</I>
I appreciate your point here, and I was a little bit too easy on the  
exam. I agree that any certification exam should be a reliable  
indicator of a certain level of knowledge. I think doing that is  
harder than people realize. That's why I am not a huge proponent of  
certs in general.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To suggest that anything that doesn't cover Silverlight and AJAX in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> depth barely &quot;scratches the surface&quot; of .NET security is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preposterous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You forgot to mention OOA&amp;D and EAI along with Web 2.0. In my mind,
</I>&gt;<i> you can't even do Web 2.0 security unless you understand the security
</I>&gt;<i> implications of EAI and OOA&amp;D.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>OK. I'm not sure what you mean, but I probably agree with you. Design  
and architecture have huge security ramifications.

&gt;<i> This appears to be turning into an argument, so let me cut off that
</I>&gt;<i> thinking right now. I'm not arguing to look smarter or be cooler than
</I>&gt;<i> you. I'm making valid points about what I think needs to be done
</I>&gt;<i> versus what is actually happening. You appear to be putting words in
</I>&gt;<i> my mouth, so I also want to make corrections that validates my earlier
</I>&gt;<i> accurate assessment. I stand behind what I said, and there is little
</I>&gt;<i> you can do to counter it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The overwhelming majority of development in ASP.NET uses these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technologies very lightly if at all and fundamentally they don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change the game with server-side code (where plenty of very serious
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vulnerabilities still hang out). I feel like the Web 2.0/AJAX/
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Silverlight/Cloud Security/Web Services topics and presentations are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more about racking up speaking opportunities for consultants and are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really over-represented in terms of the actual threat that these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technologies pose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then why does ASP.NET lack XML encoding and CSRF protections: two
</I>&gt;<i> extremely valuable protections necessary for anything related to any
</I>&gt;<i> of the above technologies? Or missing LDAP parameterization while at
</I>&gt;<i> the same time, ADFS is being rolled out en mass? I guess the point
</I>&gt;<i> that you are missing is that we need to train these concepts now i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;before&quot; developers start using them. I think it's being proactive
</I>&gt;<i> instead of reactive. Your comment also appears to be directed towards
</I>&gt;<i> me - I'd like to know where I have racked up speaking engagements
</I>&gt;<i> around Web 2.0/Cloud? Who exactly is over-representing them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think ASP.NET has some security gaps, and I'm on board with the idea  
that we need to get developers the materials they need to address  
those gaps.

I did not mean to target you - at all. I'm actually just as guilty as  
anyone - I presented at the first OWASP conference about web services  
security :) I don't think I'm the only one who recognizes that the  
security industry has &quot;buzzwords&quot; that generate a lot of interest,  
sometimes without a lot of merit.


&gt;<i> I guess I would agree with you in theory that Web 2.0 and Cloud are
</I>&gt;<i> hype, but at the same time - the Microsoft ASP.NET team has done quite
</I>&gt;<i> a lot to improve the BCL for security, but nothing to help anything
</I>&gt;<i> external to the BCL...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind of like the same way that the Microsoft Vista team made sure that
</I>&gt;<i> all but 97 default executables and DLLs had ASLR and SafeSEH
</I>&gt;<i> protections, but did nothing to improve the situation for external,
</I>&gt;<i> often bundled, OEM and ISV software...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OK, I think that's probably a generalization regarding the BCL, but I  
get the jist. MS has done a lot for security, though. Anyone who's  
reviewed applications in ASP.NET, PHP, Java, etc probably has an  
opinion on who's created a more &quot;securable&quot; framework. In my opinion,  
ASP.NET is one of the easiest to create a secure application with.  
But, the job is far from over - still a lot of ground to cover, and of  
course the new technologies are always changing the game.
