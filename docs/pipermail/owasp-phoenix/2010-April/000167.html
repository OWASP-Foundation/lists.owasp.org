<PRE>All,

Apologies for the late email, however we are in fact still planning on
meeting tomorrow.  Erik Peterson from Veracode will be coming to
discuss &quot;*Protecting
Your Applications from Backdoors: How to Secure Your Business Critical
Applications from Time Bombs, Backdoors &amp; Data&quot;.  *This should be a really
great opportunity to learn!

*Additionally, tomorrow's meeting is going to be held at:

*
*University of Advanced Technology in Tempe.
*
*2625 W. BASELINE RD.
TEMPE, AZ 85283-1056 *
*
*Going forward, this will be our new location for meetings.  I'd like to
personally thank Barry from Executrain who was graciously letting us use the
previous facility.

There are lots of other updates to talk about, but the largest by far is
that Adam is moving out of the state and a few of us are picking up the
responsibility of helping lead this group in the future.  Adam has done a
great job of the last few years with growing this group and we are going to
miss him around the valley.  He is moving (and may have already moved) to
NYC.  Pete Roalofs will be taking over as the lead contact for the Phoenix
chapter going forward (though you can also ping me for any questions).

Finally we are intending on continuing our tradition of drinks afterwords.
Given the new venue we are still investing the best place to imbibe.  We
should have more details tomorrow.

I think, therefore I am.. I think....
