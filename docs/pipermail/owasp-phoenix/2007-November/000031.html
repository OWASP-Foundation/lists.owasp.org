<PRE>QuietMove has successfully taught our web application security training
to a large number of organizations in a private training format. Now,
for the for the first time, we're delivering this hands-on, lab-driven
training in a public forum.

This training will be conducted in North County, San Diego (think the
Sorrento Valley, La Jolla, Del Mar area). Lunch is included - sponsored
by Fortify Software. Significant discounts are available for friends of
Phoenix OWASP and other travelers. Group hotel rates and transportation
to/from the airport are being arranged.

The details are in my email signature - let me know if you would like
additional information.
We're also planning classes for Phoenix in Q1 2008. 

Best regards,
Adam

Dec. 3-7 in San Diego
3 Tracks of Web Application Security Training 

QuietMove in cooperation with Business Partners Solutions will be
conducting web application security training the week of Dec 3-7.

Learning about the threats, countermeasures, and immediately applicable
development strategies which can be used to integrate security into your
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a proven risk reduction
strategy.

All classes qualify as OWASP Top Ten Training, per v1.0 and v1.1 of the
PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

We will provide certificates to the attendees and all classes qualify
for CPE credits for CISM, CISSP, and CISA.

&#183; 2 day Application Security for Software Developers (Dec 3-4)

&#183; 2 day Web Hacking for Security Professionals (Dec 5-6)
