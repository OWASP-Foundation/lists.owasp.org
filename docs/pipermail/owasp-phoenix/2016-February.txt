Dear *Owasp-phoenix Subscribers,*

I'm excited to announce our next OWASP Phoenix chapter meeting, which will
be held at Early Warning on Wednesday, February 17.  Jim Manico will be
presenting on the OWASP Top 10 Proactive Defenses.

First time attendees should show up about 15-20 minutes early to facilitate
the badging process; a picture ID is required.  For return visitors, a RSVP
through the meetup site will allow me to ask for your badge to be
pre-printed.

Free pizza will be provided shortly before the presentation.

Notably, Jim Manico lives in Hawaii, so it will be a treat to have him
presenting to us during his visit.

Regards, Joaquin

If you use Meetup.com, please RSVP so that I know how many potential
attendees we might have.  http://www.meetup.com/owasp-phoenix

Feb 17: Jim Manico

The Beatles once sang, "I've got to admit it's getting better, a little
better all the time, because it can't get more worse" and that applies
directly to the field application security. The successes in building
security into common application development frameworks is remarkable and
has, in some ways, made secure coding less of an effort to the developer.
While much needs to be done in this area, there are many very positive
examples of security characteristics built correctly into frameworks. This
talk with bring the positive vibe to OWASP Phoenix and highlight that
things really are getting better in AppSec - all time - if you look in the
right places."

Jim Manico is the founder of Manicode Security where he trains software
developers on secure coding and security engineering. He is also the
founder of Brakeman Security, Inc. and is a investor/advisor for Signal
Sciences. Jim is a frequent speaker on secure software practices and is a
member of the JavaOne rockstar speaker community. Jim is also a Global
Board Member for the OWASP foundation where he helps drive the strategic
