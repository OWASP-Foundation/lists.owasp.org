 *SharePoint Hacking - Advanced SharePoint Security Tools and Tips*

*Speaker: *Francis Brown -Stach & Liu

*
*

Microsoft SharePoint products and technologies continue to grow in
popularity and have become the core foundation upon which many organizations
have built their web presence. Unfortunately, guidance concerning common
SharePoint security issues tends to be overly complex and often
misunderstood. Ultimately this results in insecurely configured and deployed
SharePoint instances in production environments.

This demonstration rich presentation will cover our newly released
SharePoint hacking tools and techniques that security professionals can
easily use to identify and exploit common insecure configurations in
SharePoint applications. Some of the areas we?ll attempt to tackle are:
? Identifying vulnerable SharePoint applications using public search engines
such as Google and Bing
? Gaining unauthorized access to SharePoint administrative web interfaces
? Exploiting holes in SharePoint site user permissions and inheritance
? Illustrating the dangers of granting excessive access to normal user
accounts
? Pillaging Active Directory via insecure SharePoint services
? Attacking 3rd party plugins/code within SharePoint
? And much more?

.

infrastructure. Prior to that, Francis was a consultant with the Ernst &
Young Advanced Security Centers and conducted network, application,
wireless, and remote access penetration tests for Fortune 500 clients.*

*Francis has presented his research at leading conferences such as InfoSec
World, Black Hat USA, and DEFCON, and has been cited in numerous industry
and academic publications.*

*Francis holds a Bachelor of Science and Engineering from the University of
Pennsylvania with a major in Computer Science and Engineering and a minor in
