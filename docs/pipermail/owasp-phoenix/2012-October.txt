Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] OWASP - No meeting October.
Message-ID: <CAAGZWYmYd8SEWPKSN0a+L7ft9TmQV1e+CZt793OKYbDWM4vsjw@mail.gmail.com>

There is no meeting this month since we don't have a great speaker.
Obviously we could use some help in getting speakers. Please look around to
the people you know in the local appsec space; pen testers, developers,
etc. Ask them to come out and speak or let me know and I'll follow-up. This
is a community group and we can all help keep it running.

Cheers,
Pete
