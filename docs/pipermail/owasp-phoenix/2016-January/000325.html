Title: DevOps and Security - A match made (and broken) in the cloud

Abstract: DevOps is the new Agile, allowing organizations to move faster
and deploy code quicker. Yet in the quest for continuous delivery, security
can fall by the wayside, opening an organization up to data exposure and
malicious exploitation. This talk will cover current security research into
the technology behind DevOps, examples of failures, and how to prevent the
same from happening in your organization. Technologies discussed will
include AWS, Git, Hudson/Jenkins, and more. In the end, the presentation
should help attendees understand the risks involved in running a DevOps
environment.


Bio: Seth Law is the Director of Research &amp; Development at nVisium and
wrangles the research efforts into all areas of application security. An
experienced Application Security Professional with years of security
experience, Seth has worked in multiple disciplines, from software
development to network protection, as a manager, contributor, and speaker.
Seth explores the world of application security via @sethlaw.
