Join the PLUG Hackfesters for Puppet Theatre next Saturday @10:00AM!

We will be swiftly going through the presentation materials published
this month on the LinuxGazette:
http://linuxgazette.net/165/kachold.html
followed by a hands on session to three systems setup for the event.
Bring your recipes!

Our network model this time will be both wireless and wired, so that
we can continue both a FLAG event and our Puppet presentation/lab.

Our guest, Dennis Kibbe, well known for his long contribution to the
PLUG InstallFests and adjunct teacher with Mesa Community College,
will be appearing as a FLAG (good luck to one and all)!

Session closes at 13:00 this time, in our earlier time slot.

Our volunteers will also be attempting to:

1) Build yet another Accessibility Linux System for testing by the
Foundation's students.
2) Provide USB-CD/DVD media build station and services for BT4/Ubuntu/DVL/Samari

Watch for the Backtrack4 LinuxGazette September materials which will
be our next HackFest lab subject.

<goodie goodie goodie!>

A disclaimer signature is required for admittance, which states you
agree to only attack clearly designated FLAGs, announce any and all
flags, and swiftly report any security threats you might encounter to
the Foundation for Blind Children staff.

Any and all failing to follow these Security Lab Acceptable Use
Guidelines, will be honeypot trapped, logged and reported everywhere
possible through the Foundation's extensive resources.

IDS experts, honeypot builders and network forensics volunteers please
contact me off list.

See you there!

Thanks Andrew you beat me to it!

I am really excited about your talk, because the Microsoft SDL and Threat
Modeling stuff is very high quality... and you didn't just read about it...
you use it.

I am also pleased to announce that blogger extrordinaire and ex-Gartner
analyst Rich Mogul will be our speaker in Sept! The topic is really cool,
but a secret until his actual presentation.

Hello, registered speaker from geekspeakr.com

Here's a quick message from someone who found your speaker profile:
Lisa Kachold.

Message: Hi Lisa - I see you're into security.
checkout out the kiwicon CFP:

A wise deadite captain once yelled "Cry Havoc and let loose the Dogs of War!".
Quite frankly, we couldn't have said it better ourselves:

      KIWICON ]|[

28TH & 29TH NOVEMBER 2009

With a current record of three arrests, seven conceptions and one committal
Kiwicon is back for 2k9. The time has come to fake up an abstract and submit it
to the Kiwicon Crue for judgement. In the coming months, we predict you will
spend more time dreaming of kudos and UID 0 than actually working on your
slides, since you'll be doing them the night before anyway.

It's not New Zealand's only security conference, but it is the one where you're
more likely to get a standing ovation for scanning an entire country than
pointed questions regarding whether you were, perhaps, a little reckless in
accessing systems without authorisation.

     _
  _-(")-
`%%%%%    `KIWICON`
 // \\

The Crue holds a special place in their bowels for those who are aggravated
that Kiwicon is held on a weekend so they don't get time off work.

It is a gathering for those who are passionate about security. It has been
hacked together by the .nz security scene for the .nz security community.
Following in the tradition of previous cons, the atmosphere is extremely laid
back; even the feds don't wear suits.

Kiwicon is about sharing information. It's about intersections and
cross-pollination and dissemination and other nouns disturbing reminiscent of a
pre-AIDs key party. Sure, you could bring your RFID readers, your lockpicks or
even your back track DVD but mostly you just need to bring yourself and the
willingness to learn.

For a little con down under we don't do too bad. Previously, Kiwicon has
featured: the Crackstation, iKat (last seen at a airport near you), layer two
telco shenanigans, a video montage of boardrooms across Japan, old school
phreaking on new school kit, exposure of RIM's failure to hide their snooping
capabilities, fun with the SCADA systems, making Microsoft look like turkeys,
nuking various heap protections from space, and of course fucking up the
certificate chain of your new passport.

     _
  _-(")-
`%%%%%
 // \\    `THE VENUE`

The Crue is aware that location is everything, so once again we will be
invading the Pipitea Campus which is surrounded by prestigious Wellington
buildings such as Parliament house, the (partly renovated and badly secured)
High Court, Ministry of Defence and various telecommunication hubs. All
services are handy to the venue as well (train station, taxi rank, burger
caravan, police cells / court etc).

Caffeination will be provided by the lovely folks at Sweet Fanny-Anne's.

     _
  _-(")-
`%%%%%
 // \\    `THE PRICE`

A recession-proof fifty bucks for the employed. Students and those otherwise
supported by our precious taxpayer dollars (this does not include Members of
Parliament) will pay $30. GST receipts will be available on request.

The Crue will endeavour to leverage its synergies to architect a compelling ROI
solution.

     _
  _-(")-
`%%%%%
 // \\    `THE TOPICS`

Social networking/automated stalking, Cellular Networks (GSM,2degrees,
openbts), State-sponsored surveillance, Malware (Viruses, Botnets), The Scam of
EAL Certification, Industrial Espionage, Reverse Engineering, The Failwhale
Rider, Virtualisation, Flash mobs, WebApps, 0hday

The schedule will be made up as we go, so fifteen minutes or thirty minutes
worth of material should be submitted as fifteen or thirty minutes worth of
talk. We do place an upper limit of an hour (including questions), as anything
longer than that can continue at the pub.

     _
  _-(")-
`%%%%%
 // \\    `SUBMISSIONS`

These need to be in by the Witching Hour of the 31st October (NZST). Expats and
wanna-be Kiwis will want to get their submissions in by 10th October, when
we're going to be announcing the first round of Interesting Stuff.

To submit a presentation to Kiwicon2k9, send an email to cfp at kiwicon.org with

   * Country of Residence:
   * Employer (if applicable):

If you do not provide a bio, one will be provided for you.

The Crue want you to submit your talk to Kiwicon or the cute little header
sheep gets it.

Women in Technology:

"Women in Technology" Committee/Track

Please join the
[http://lists.ableconf.com/listinfo.cgi/wit-ableconf.com committee
mailing list]

Program chair:  ABLEconf2009wit at ardmorevalleyproductions.com
(Please protect this email address from online spiders via obfuscation
to control spam!)

Focus:  Women working in "technology", women with techno-career
aspirations, women with volunteering power for ABLEconf to promote
education about technology.  This track can include appropriate
presentations from other tracks as well as those specifically meant
for WIT.

There are three primary goal areas:
* Promoting women volunteers to present at ABLEconf
* Promoting women volunteering in other ways at ABLEconf
* Inviting women to attend ABLEconf (Technical Ability is interesting
and very rewarding!)

For presenters, what topics does ABLEconf want?
* Primarily technology for business
* Technology, business and balance as they relate to WIT
* Anything that facilitates success for WIT (beit psychology,
sociology, health or technical FOSS related)

== Recruiting Technology Presenters ==

"Pretty much anything is fair game.  I (the chair) personally think
that in order to attract women, we need to avoid limiting technology
discussions to open source, although we want to encourage that.  It
seems to me that the combination of woman + technology + open source
is perhaps a little too rarified and if we limit presentations to
that, we may fail entirely.  Anything you know about technology is
fair game for consideration."   - Der Hans - 2009

Ideas for Presenters/Presentations (expect overlap with other tracks):
* OpenOffice.org (Der Hans (Chair) presents annually on OpenOffice
also - confer to provide unique content)
* Linux Servers or Linux Hosting
* Linux Business Applications
* Linux in Early Childhood Education
* Home Schooling with FOSS
* Graphic design with FOSS
* Web Development with FOSS
* VOIP and Cell Technology Solutions for Extended Family or Business Networking
* Women, Trust and Open Source -
* Business, Security and Social Intrusion Detection Systems
* Camera/monitoring Systems for Everyone
* Wordpress, Facebook, WeeWeb, Text Messaging and Twitter
* Gender, Socialization and Techno-Individualism
* Medical, Criminal, Court & Credit Information Technology in a Digital Age

== Recruiting Business Presenters ==

Ideas for Presenters/Presentations (may overlap with other tracks):
* Current Federal Financial (Loan/Bond) aide Programs for
Women/Minority-Owned Businesses
* Challenges (& Solutions) for Gender Stereotyping in Business Technology
* Panel Discussion: Women WIT  -- Statistical Overview - share
anecdotes of the good, the bad and the ugly.  Share war stories and
brag to dispell misconceptions of what roles women currently hold in
technology, what differences exist industry wide, and how women are
perceived in team business technical environments.
* Evolution of remote workers; home workers; telecommuters in business
technology.  Job Sharing, team contracting, and the Internet,
including solutions for staying motivated, educated and connected.
* Employment Related: Legal ramifications and rights for Federal
overtime exempt engineers, managers, programmers and other creative
engineers or developers and the melding of technology roles in small
start ups (or how to keep from being required to work 90 hours a week
on salary, while being on call 24X7 365 days a year) during an
economic avalanche.

Sept 1- Former Gartner analyst and Securosis blog dude Rich Mogull!

I'll be updating the Wiki /  calendar today.

This should be an exciting talk, Rich is a very smart guy and a great
speaker. And... we aren't announcing the topic. But, it's Rich, so you know
it will be worth hearing.

Also, SunSec is returning as the Phoenix OWASP happy hour.

Looking forward to seeing you all!
