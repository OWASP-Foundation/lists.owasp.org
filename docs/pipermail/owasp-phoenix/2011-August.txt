2011 Appsec Tools State-of-the-Art

Andre Gironda


BIO:
Andre works for the HP Application Security Center (ASC) doing
application penetration-testing, secure code review, and reverse
engineering. He has 9 years of direct experience with application
security topics, has been using Burp Suite on pen-tests since early
2005, and runs his own tool benchmarks at home in Tempe, AZ.

Abstract:
Every tool you should leverage during an app pen-test or secure code
review will be discussed. The two best web proxies, Burp Pro
(@portswigger) and Fiddler (@ericlaw) will be demonstrated along with
the two best crawlers from @netsparker and WebInspect. The results
from @sectooladdict will be discussed and the analysis demonstrated on
@owaspbwa. Additional topics will be discussed, such as executive
management reporting using dradisframework.org by way of imports from
@w3af. There will also be topics for application developers, such as
the new OWASP Data Exchange Format Project, as well as using
CAT.NET<http://cat.net/>
,
RIPS, LAPSE+, and Fortify to go from vulnerable sources to runtime
analysis to full exploitation. Even esoteric tools from long-ago that
have held their value will be discussed and potentially demonstrated
if there is time

Drinks will be found afterword at Doc & Eddies.

Doc & Eddy's, 909 East Minton Drive, Tempe, AZ 85282-7021
