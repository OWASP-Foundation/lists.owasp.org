Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Meeting Cancelled
Message-ID: <CAANLsN-q7L0yGfUEnEcHgC3U_=AsAohZE6VTEDqFyjOBFyPSow@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Sorry for the short notice, but with the holidays and other planning--
we don't have a speaker for tomorrow.  We will retool and get ready
for the next year, meeting again in January.  If people wanted to grab
a beer on Tuesday instead, drop me an email and we can figure
something out.  Maybe I could show you some cool hacks on my laptop or
something.

In the mean time, have you registered for BSidesPHX?  We've already
sold out about 1/4th of the tickets in 5 days.  Please register soon
to ensure you will have a spot.
