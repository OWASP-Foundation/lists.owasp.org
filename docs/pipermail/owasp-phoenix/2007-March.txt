Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Next OWASP Meeting
Message-ID: <01d101c77088$0b7504f0$0ef01fac@DVDA>

Hey Everyone,

 

For the next meeting we are planning on having quick demonstrations of
application security tools.  So far, we have the following people
presenting:

 

Jon Rose - XSS Frameworks

Andre Gironda - Proxy and Scanning Tools

Vinnie Liu - TBD

 

Please let me know if anyone is interested in presenting a short demo of an
app tool (15-30 minutes) and I can put you on the list.  Please check out
the Phoenix Tools page (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix/Tools) for a
list of tools.  I really appreciate all your help and support in making this
group a success!

 

Thanks,

Jon
