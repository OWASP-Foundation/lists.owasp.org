Hi all:

 

My name is Bill Landry and I work with some of the top tech companies in the Chicago area. I have a Director Level job available and its main functions are to build and service scalable security services for applications, spot vulnerability trends, ensure application security, and provide technical expertise and collaborate with other information security teams.

 

If you are interested in this Chicago position or know anyone you think I should be talking with, please shoot me an email. You would have to relocate to the Chicago area, company does pay for relocation. 

 

 

 

Thanks,

Bill Landry
