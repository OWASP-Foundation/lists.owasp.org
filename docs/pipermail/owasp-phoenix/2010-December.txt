Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Major Edit of Phoenix/Tools
Message-ID: <4CFF6658.1050107@owasp.org>


Hi all,

I did some changes to the list (see subject) because
it could have done better.

* Page has a toc now!

* Rearrangements in the order so that the page
  has a structure now including sections and subsections

Minor things:

* Tools section
  ** w3af wput in the right section
  ** added WATOBO, arachni
  ** fuzzdb
* Added minor stuff here and there


On my wishlist (hey, it's close Xmas):

* Check each link (e.g. LiveLines link wasn't working and there was no such
plugin @ mozilla.org)
* check relevance/correctness for each entry
* sort each section alphabetically

Are there any constraints why classical commercial scanners or
SCAs are not mentioned?


Cheers,

Dirk

	Reloaded
Message-ID: <AANLkTikRwi1C_aNhYA0oFRZY1Tr0DQyUc=wBvg5LFQph@mail.gmail.com>

Monthly Meeting - Tuesday January 4th 2011 6:30
*OWASP Phoenix invites you to it's January meeting!*
Tuesday January 4th 2011 6:30 - 8:00 PM.    The meetings are always free,
unfortunately the drinks aren't.
Location: University of Advancing Technology 2625 W. BASELINE RD. TEMPE, AZ
85283-1056

This month's meeting:

* Heat Sync Labs*
A introduction from Heat Sync to talk about Arizona's first hackerspace in
Chandler
http://www.heatsynclabs.org/
**
**
main presentation:

*Appsec Design Reviews Reloaded*

*Speaker: Andre Gironda*

*
**Appsec Design Reviews Reloaded*

The best place to start in the software lifecycle is during the design
phase.

Workflow tools exist for SDL processes, build servers,
penetration-testing activities, and many other application security
checkpoints. However, very few tools and techniques exist or are
readily available when performing application security design reviews.
The full process of application security should be agreed upon during
the design phase by the security department and all relevant
application development teams. The direction of the projects and the
patterns used in the application architectures can also be augmented
from an application security perspective.

This presentation will provide discussion around how to solve many of
these and other challenges in application security. The focus will be
on web applications that use common technologies, such as managed code
frameworks.

*Bio:**
Andre has contributed to many OWASP documents and has been working in
the appsec space for almost 5 years. He is a local to the Phoenix area
and has presented on application security topics recently at BSides,
OWASP, and Toorcon events.

Drinks will be found afterward at Doc & Eddies.
