Improving your Fu

Speaker: Andrew Wilson



Delivering high quality results is the goal and earmark of any serious
security practitioner.  Professional penetration testing requires a set of
reliable skills that will enable him/her to deliver consistently.  Tools
simply aren't enough.  This talk outlines 10 of the more important
disciplines and practices you can do to build or grow that solid foundation.


 *Bio:

Trustwave's SpiderLabs - the advanced security team focused on penetration

experience building and securing software for a variety of companies. Andrew

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Local small business needs vulnerability help
Message-ID: <BANLkTinKVqK6--3Ks-A1Prgkh=zcvQC7jQ@mail.gmail.com>

To whom it may concern:

I am a small business owner here in the valley (locate in Scottsdale) and I
recently had my website hacked with what looks like an XSS script. I?ve been
trying to find a security assessment person but I?m getting blown out of the
park with the pricing from the companies I've talked with. For a small
business owner, I think it best that I find an independent consultant which
is how I discovered OWASP. The chapter leaders in Phoenix suggested I send
an email to the group.

 If you're interested in consulting on a vulnerability assessment please
respond to the email and we can discuss details.

Thank you

Obfuscating Search Queries with Hayst.ac

Speaker: David Huerta



Hayst.ac, is a browser userscript to obfuscate search queries with

machine-generated queries with the goal to be as close to

indistinguishable from the human generated ones as possible. This is

ultimately to discourage the use of search histories as a source of

user profiling.


Bio:

After arriving in Arizona from the posh, cosmopolitan enclave of

southeastern Idaho, David founded the DeVry Linux User Group (DeLUG)

in 2003, an originally student organization that drew members and

activities from the greater West Valley Free software community,

including students at GCC and ASU West.  He also serves on the board

of directors for HeatSync Labs, a hackerspace in Chandler.
