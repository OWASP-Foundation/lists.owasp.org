<PRE>Dear *Owasp-phoenix Subscribers,*

I'm happy to announce our next OWASP Phoenix chapter meeting, which will be
held at Early Warning on Wednesday, October 14, 2015.

Notably, the speaker is flying in from out of town and this date worked
best for his schedule.  I hope that the day and venue change allows members
to attend that had schedule or location challenges.  I'm sure this also
created conflicts for some of you, so apologies, and we look forward to
having you join when we are back to our regular schedule.

Regards, Joaquin

If you use Meetup.com, please RSVP so that I know how many potential
attendees we might have.  <A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/owasp-phoenix">http://www.meetup.com/owasp-phoenix</A>

these systems can be abused and leveraged to break into corporate networks.
A penetration testing methodology will be discussed and technical
demonstrations of attacks will be shown. Phases of this methodology include
information gathering, network mapping, vulnerability identification,
penetration, privilege escalation, and maintaining access. Methods for
organizations to better protect systems will also be discussed.
