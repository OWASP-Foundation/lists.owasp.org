Dear *Owasp-phoenix Subscribers,*


I'm excited to announce our next OWASP Phoenix chapter meetings, which will
be held at Early Warning on Thursday, June 2nd and Wednesday, July 12th.

Next Thursday, Seth Law will be presenting "Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto:
Security-Testing in the Real World".

Free pizza will be provided shortly before the presentation.


Notably, July's meeting will be held on Wednesday, July 12th at Early
Warning. Dan ?AltF4? Petro and Ben Morris will be presenting ?Weaponizing
Machine Learning: Humanity Was Overrated Anyway?

Details have also been posted to the Chapter Page: https://www.owasp.org/

If you use Meetup.com <http://meetup.com/>, please RSVP so that I know how
many potential attendees we might have and can buy enough pizza.

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Please vote for a Waspy Award for Joaquin
Message-ID: <CAM7+66M2-8P-_QPxRAS1t-+Q1XO9waLf3xsMrH0gX8ZeoDx6EA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All - Joaquin has put a LOT of work into making the Phoenix OWASP
Chapter a great experience.  If you agree, please consider nominating
Joaquin for a Waspy award here before June 30th:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/WASPY_Awards_2017

Joaquin did NOT ask me to do this, but I visit a LOT of different ITSec
meetings all over the US and Phoenix OWASP has been GREAT since Joaquin
stepped up.
Please help me ensure Joaquin gets the recognition he deserves.
The deadline is June 30th, so please don't procrastinate.
Thanks!

Andy

Agreed, and done. A few years ago OWASP was all but defunct and Joaquin has lead the charge to resurrect it. As someone who has lead a sizable tech user group in the past, I can attest to the fact that while it may look trivial, it is a lot of hard work and very time consuming. I have really appreciated Joaquin?s efforts, and the quality of the meeting content. I?m already looking forward to July?s meet-up!?

For those wanting to nominate ? they ask for full name and email address..here is what I had:?

Joaquin Fuentes
joaquin.fuentes at owasp.org

You don?t have to nominate for all categories, but they do require all nominations to be filled out, just put ?NONE? in the ones you aren?t nominating for as fields are required.?
