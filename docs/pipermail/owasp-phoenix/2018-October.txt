Security Enthusiasts! Please RSVP on Meetup.com if you plan to attend. This
meetup will be held at Early Warning.  See the following link for details:
https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Phoenix/events/255429881/

We're lucky enough to have another speaker from out-of-town again, speaking
on a very important topic in the industry.

In this session, Marija will talk on the tech world from a woman?s point of
view, discussing how she got to where she is today, how Mentoring and
Passion are what really propel you forward, (along with helping you pay it
forward!), and of course, she?ll talk about Security.

Pizza will be provided by Early Warning. Make sure to arrive early to
facilitate the badging process.

We also have an unsponsored happy hour following the meet-up. It will be at
the Vig, McDowell Mtn Ranch Rd.
