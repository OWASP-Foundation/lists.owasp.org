<PRE>All,

Sorry for the late notice but we are unfortunately going to need to cancel
tomorrow's meeting.  We do, however, have a presenter for July 3rd's
meeting.  Details below:

*Not the end of XSS*
*
*

XSS is by no means a solved problem. There is no silver bullet, function
call or technology that makes

you absolutely immune. This talk is focusing on bypassing Anti-XSS filters
found in browsers as well

as bypassing Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. This talk covers
how these technologies are

used to protect a web application and how they can be abused by an attacker.


*Michael Brooks*

Michael Brooks was in the top 1% of earners in the Google bug bounty
program. He has written

exploits for software you have probably used, patches have been written and
we are all safer for it. A

perfectly secure system can never be accomplished, test everything, trust
nothing.


As you may have noticed we are doing a bit of a reset with the chapter.
 Please expect this next month's meeting to go a small bit longer as we
would like to go over some of those changes.

Again, we apologize for not meeting this month.  Please feel to reach out
to Pete or I if you have any questions.

-Andrew

P.S:  I am starting a local Arizona Capture The Flag competition team.
 Please email me privately if you have any interest in joining.

-- 
We are so dazzled by the speed and expanding applications of technology
that we begin to think it is an adequate substitute for what it replaces. -
Peter Block
