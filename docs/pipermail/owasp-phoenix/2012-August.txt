Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] 2 Information Security Positions @ Arizona State
	University
Message-ID: <24B9835E4C801944B20BF620C84BB0DE0B4E1A47@exmbt05.asurite.ad.asu.edu>

I've been on ASU's Information Security team for several years and in my opinion it is a great place to work.

We have one junior level position open and one senior level. Although the senior position title says "Architect" it entails a full range of security related projects from proactive measures (vulnerability testing, network redesigns) to auditor-like stuff such as detective and preventive controls.

For an intro to some of our work see the Information Security web site http://getprotected.asu.edu/ or the University Technology Office site https://uto.asu.edu/  (The UTO is the central IT organization for ASU, while departments also have their own IT teams.)

I cannot help you to the head of the line, however, so please use the links provided if you are interested. I don't want to clutter the OWASP email list, so I'd discourage reply-all type discussions.

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Hackfesting at DeVry
Message-ID: <CAEYqmRtK9fqdDnpnP9qouaDsoe6ROz3185y1QSPA4teXiHnmgg@mail.gmail.com>

David Demland has us setup with a great lab at DeVry University on Phoenix
for our practical sessions.  We can boot security distros to do some forays
on a roomful of cisco equipment, attack flags, or do actual hands on
practicals in teams.  We now have networks available with a mere flip of a
switch!

*This year we are resurrecting the "Dummie Drill"; answer security
questions from David Demland (Professor at DeVry) correctly and get a 2012
Hackfest tee-shirt.*

This next September Hackfest (2nd Saturday of every month from 11AM - 3PM)
will include investigation of Backtrack 5R3 - come get a copy and play
along?

We will have flags (running from Virtualization) and this year we also have
the DEFCON 20 commercial videos running or available (now with full AV
equipment and speakers) should you have a request.  This mixed
lab/presentation allows us to hack, watch and talk simultaneously in full
duplex linux manner.

We have instructions to enter through the South door at DeVry and go up the
stairs, where access is supposed to be open for us.  If there is an issue
with the door, please don't pick the lock, just go around to the Campus
library desk and exchange an ID for a badge or give us a call (#'s below)
so we can get you in. Parking is easy, but please park in the visitor slots.

Call me if you get lost!

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] OWASP Phoenix September 4th Meeting -- Content
 Discovery and Link Extraction for Application Security Testing
Message-ID: <CAAGZWY=k8qh6ppWBz17z0-cPGwEO+MtDT6nmkYFothn2DB2uPQ@mail.gmail.com>

*OWASP Phoenix invites you to it's September meeting!*
Tuesday September 4th 2012 6:30 - 7:30 PM at University of Advancing
Technology
2625 W. BASELINE RD. TEMPE, AZ 85283 (in the 1st floor theater)



Content Discovery and Link Extraction for Application Security Testing

Andre Gironda


Andre Gironda, HP, will be presenting on "Content Discovery and Link
Extraction for Application Security Testing". The talk will be focused on
how to discover content the right way and make decisions before actual
testing begins, as well as how to adjust needs during a on-going test. Most
of the discussion will be tool agnostic, but it will help attendees if they
have some prior experience with tools such as OWASP DirBuster or a
commercial-grade crawler such as Netsparker Community Edition.


Drinks will be found afterword at Doc & Eddies. (or groups choice)

Doc & Eddy's, 909 East Minton Drive, Tempe, AZ 85282-7021
