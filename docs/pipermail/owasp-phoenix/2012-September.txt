 Content Discovery and Link Extraction for Application Security Testing

Andre Gironda


Andre Gironda, HP, will be presenting on "Content Discovery and Link
Extraction for Application Security Testing". The talk will be focused on
how to discover content the right way and make decisions before actual
testing begins, as well as how to adjust needs during a on-going test. Most
of the discussion will be tool agnostic, but it will help attendees if they
have some prior experience with tools such as OWASP DirBuster or a
commercial-grade crawler such as Netsparker Community Edition.


Drinks will be found afterword at Doc & Eddies. (or groups choice)

Doc & Eddy's, 909 East Minton Drive, Tempe, AZ 85282-7021

Hackfest today 11AM-2PM in our new location at DeVry University on the
second floor.

We will be previewing Backtrack5r3 - new features.  We might have
VirtualBox flags, but we will be concentrating on assist everyone to get a
USB or DVD setup for your festing fun. I will be giving out DVD's with
BT5r3.

Sorry we don't have the DEFCON 20 vids yet. There are some online, but not
as good as the commercial ones coming thanks to Ben Trussell - ASU.

We have a great number of Cisco devices to exploit at the facility - all
unpatched.  We will go over how to Network Discovery and more, depending on
time.

Are you a Gimp?
We have a TeeShirt Design Contest also.  The winner will get a USB drive
and a TeeShirt free.

See you at DeVry!
