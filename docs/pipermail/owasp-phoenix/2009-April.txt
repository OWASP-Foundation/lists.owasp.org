Is there going to be a meeting this month?  I haven't seen anything
posted and I want to make sure that I don't miss out.  The presentation
by Scott White last month was definitely helpful.

Message-ID: <cb9225660904071102u346ea0e4ic95676e7435a41d7@mail.gmail.com>

6:30 at Executrain...

Executrain 3600 E University Dr # A1400 Phoenix, AZ 85034

The entrance is on the West side of the building. Look for the suite number
on the door.

Tonight's meeting:


To build the chapter, I am thinking we should take a page out of the
playbook o other chapters... hold a half-day mini-conference on web app
security.

No presentation tonight - we will brainstorm!

I was catching up on some old Black Hat presentations and was reminded about the brainstorming meeting we had. I just wanted to throw out a couple names of people who's work I admire and think they would be good candidaites for speaking at our conference:

Nate Mcfeters
Billy Rios
Bryan Sullivan

they may not be the biggest names but they always seem to be doing interesting work.

aren't the securosis guys local? I'm sure if we reached out to them they would be happy to get involved.

And Douglas Haider (wifijedi.com) is another local I admire. He's mostly focused on wireless stuff but you never know, it might be worth asking if he would have anything relevant to contribute.

just some ideas, thinking out loud.

Message-ID: <cb9225660904171421s76f64c13o3dafcb1ca1a1ef08@mail.gmail.com>

My notes:

The focus will be on PCI Section 6, the "web app security" requirement.

   - Panel discussions
   - Keynote - hopefully vendor sponsored
   - 2 tracks - technical and management.
   - 1 track in AM and one in PM? Or both at the same time?

Presentation topics:

   - Client side browser security
   - What is OWASP?
   - "Top 10" Overview
   - Fraud war stories
   - PCI Section 6

Who to involve:

   - Developer user groups
   - Local businesses
   - HTCIA
   - ISSA
   - ?

I am going to create a google spreadsheet with the notes so far and tracking
tasks to complete (user groups to contact and inquire how we might get their
participation, all the logistics, etc) - if you're interested in helping
make this come together, reply by email and I'll give you write access.
