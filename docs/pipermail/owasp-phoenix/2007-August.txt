Sorry for the delayed response, but things have only just firmed up on
my end. I will NOT be attending and / or presenting. (Drunken
conversations @ BH / Defcon notwithstanding)

I have a bachelor party to attend. No, I cannot miss it, I'm the best man.

Hope everyone has fun.

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Owasp Day - Sept 6?
Message-ID: <1188497151.28522.31.camel@suntzu>

There were no responses from chapter members regarding speaking at or
assisting with Owasp Day on Sept 6th. 

Is there any interest in keeping this event on, or should I have the
Fortify Software speaker come back for our normal meeting date/time the
following week? I am really predisposed to do that right now.

I do want Phoenix OWASP to do a larger conference type event with
national caliber speakers - I even have some vendor sponsorship lined up
for things like promotion, food, raffle items, or space etc. It would be
a good opportunity to present for Phoenix OWASP members looking for some
exposure and speaking experience.

We still need speakers to volunteer for the chapter meetings!
