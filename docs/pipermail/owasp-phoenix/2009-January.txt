OWASP 2009 is kicking off on Feb 3rd at 6:30 PM with a new location!

See the Wiki for the latest event information and location

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix

We are moving the location to ExecuTrain, on University just off the I-10,
with, as always, a social to follow at a local watering hole.

The new meeting schedule is the first Tuesday of the month, every month.

I am looking forward to seeing everyone there!
