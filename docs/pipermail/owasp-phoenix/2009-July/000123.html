<PRE>8/08/2009 10:00AM - 1:00PM

August's HackFest Lab at the Foundation for Blind Children will center
around puppet.

We will have a one-ish hour of presentation, a puppet test lab
including a fully fleshed out securely setup puppet.

We will take some fest time to show how easy it is to pull strings,
maintain configurations and standards in any network comprising two or
more systems in order to improve systems security, change policies or protect
systems in a hurry.

Please see <A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.com">http://www.linuxgazette.com</A> July &quot;Layer 8 Linux Security&quot;
Puppet article for the lab presentation materials.
<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/165/kachold.html">http://linuxgazette.net/165/kachold.html</A>

Bring your puppet recipes to wow us.
All PLUG events are full duplex,allowing for individual expansion
and enrichment as we follow our critical thought, rarely constrained by
anything other than setup time.

Dennis Kibbe, Adjunct Faculty at Mesa Community College, and regular
&quot;iconic&quot; figure at the PLUG InstallFests will be our Special Guest
FLAG, appearing with his exceedingly clean, carefully configured and
sticker decorated laptop (on it's own network), in immaculate geek shirt,
daring anyone to successfully encroach his linux.  Dennis will give us a short
description of his linux system build at the end of the August lab.

Following PLUG HackFest acceptable use guidelines (to announce any and every
flag), you can social engineer, attempt to exploit services, and/or do
anything else you can get away with to take this FLAG during our 3 hour
&quot;Puppet Theatre&quot; session.  Accolades and prizes will be available for
any success.

We will have the disk burner setup (this time using local disk [rather
than USB - which
was timing out and causing corrupted burns in July]) and be able to
make persistent
pendrives on the spot in Knoppix, BackTrack4 persistent or Ubuntu.
Bring your media.

Again, we will be taking a stab at lock picking with a table with
tools and locks setup
to ensure everyone can easily master these simple fun skills.

Network and other facilities generously provided by the Foundation for
Blind Children.  PLUG HackFesters provide symbiotic linux build services to the
Foundation for Blind Children by setting up FOSS systems to be used for
Accessibility testing by blind children and others with disabilities
at the school.

There is an open call for presentations and participants for HackFests.
We especially want to thank the PLUG community for turning out to make these
events exciting and fun.  Take the black pill and leave forever the
Security Matrix;
HackFest with PLUG!

Everything starts at around 10:00 and should break down around 13:00!
