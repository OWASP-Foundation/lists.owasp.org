<PRE>Please excuse me if you have already received this.  I posted it to the 
other side of the list I think.

I have been on the Owasp list for quite some time no but haven't had the 
opportunity to attend the meetings as I live in Payson and it is 
difficult for me to get to the valley.  I have a question that will 
prove simple to some of you on the list so I would really appreciate 
your help.

I am not sure this is where I should post this but if it is 
inappropriate please let me know.

An acquaintance who develops web pages in DreamWeaver has a client who 
is getting regular attacks from someone who is seeding a virus to his 
index.html page.

My questions  to you are:

1)   How is that possible unless he has access to the ftp connection?

2)   How can it be stopped?

I am sure you will have questions that I will need to get answers to so 
I will say thanks in advance for any help you might be able to give.

Charles
