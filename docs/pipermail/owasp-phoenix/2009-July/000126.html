<PRE>Researchers will release an open source tool at Black Hat USA that
helps forensics investigators reconstruct attacks that use a popular
Metasploit payload to covers its tracks.

Mandiant's Steve Davis and Peter Silberman have developed what might
be called an anti-anti-forensics tool, dubbed the Metasploit Forensics
Framework, which they'll demonstrate at Black Hat 2009.

The tool is aimed at unmasking what Metasploit's stealthy Meterpreter
did on a machine. Meterpreter lets developers write code in DLL files
and execute everything in memory -- without writing anything to the
victim machine's disk, where it could be detected and, in turn,
complicate incident response.

Meterpreter will download and upload files, execute code, and open its
own command shell and report if a Meterpreter packet is still in
memory, and, if so, tell us which files Meterpreter has accessed, and
whether it has modified a registry key (for m$).

Some traditional antivirus tools can't detect Meterpreter-borne
attacks because they never hit the disk. Meterpreter can reconstruct a
crime scene from memory.

The Metasploit Forensics Framework is a proof-of-concept tool that
scans the processes in memory.

Meterpreter has unique packets that can be identified to reconstruct
Metasploit processes. Peter Silberman, an engineer on the product team
at Mandiant, announced that Meterpreter will be demonstrated at Black
Hat: &quot;We're going to discuss how Meterpreter looks in memory, and how
it's able to circumvent traditional tools. We'll demonstrate how with
some advanced knowledge, you can reconstruct what commands were sent
to Meterpreter and perform an autopsy on an attack.&quot;

Memory analysis in forensics is recently catching up.  Meterpreter
helps investigators pull useful information to determine how freed
memory still provides useful information on the commands an attacker
used.

It's fully expected that Metasploit developers will come up with a
workaround for Meterpreter.  Meterpreter will be available on
Mandiant's website the day of their Black Hat presentation so everyone
can begin to experiment with it.
