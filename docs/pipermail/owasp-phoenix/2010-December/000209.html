Chandler
<A HREF="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/">http://www.heatsynclabs.org/</A>
**

main presentation:

*Appsec Design Reviews Reloaded*

*Speaker: Andre Gironda*

*
**Appsec Design Reviews Reloaded*

The best place to start in the software lifecycle is during the design
phase.

Workflow tools exist for SDL processes, build servers,
penetration-testing activities, and many other application security
checkpoints. However, very few tools and techniques exist or are
readily available when performing application security design reviews.
The full process of application security should be agreed upon during
the design phase by the security department and all relevant
application development teams. The direction of the projects and the
patterns used in the application architectures can also be augmented
from an application security perspective.

This presentation will provide discussion around how to solve many of
these and other challenges in application security. The focus will be
on web applications that use common technologies, such as managed code
frameworks.

*Bio:**
Andre has contributed to many OWASP documents and has been working in
the appsec space for almost 5 years. He is a local to the Phoenix area
and has presented on application security topics recently at BSides,
OWASP, and Toorcon events.
*

Drinks will be found afterward at Doc &amp; Eddies.
Doc &amp; Eddy's, 909 East Minton Drive, Tempe, AZ 85282-7021
