OWASP Phoenix invites you to it's December meeting!
Tuesday December 7th 2010 6:30 - 7:30 PM at University of Advancing

*Professional Burping*

Burp suite is by and large considered one of the de-facto tools for testing
web applications for security flaws.  This talk will cover many of the
professional version only features and various advanced usages that can be
done to really take advantage of all this tool has to offer.  Topics will
include a quick review of burp, effectively leveraging professional only
tools, deep dive into intruder, and using 3rd party extensions.
