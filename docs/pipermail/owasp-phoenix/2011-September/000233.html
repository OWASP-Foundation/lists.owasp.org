<PRE>All,

I wanted to get this out to you as soon as possible.  The October meeting
will be pushed back a week to the 11th of October instead of the 4th,
everything else the same.  We are doing this because we have our first out
of town speaker coming in!  Ken Johnson will be speaking on his wxFramework
project, a framework modeled after metasploit which helps penetration
testers with exploitation of web applications.

I would urge you SERIOUSLY to consider making this event and inviting as
many friends as you can get out for this.  If we can get lots of people in,
it will really help us reach out to others to come into our fine city.

Bio:

Ken Johnson is a Senior Application Security Consultant performing source
code
analysis and web application penetration testing. Ken is the primary
developer
of the Web Exploitation Framework (wXf) and contributes to various open
source application security projects. He has spoken at AppSec DC, OWASP
NoVA, Northern Virginia Hackers Association and is a contributor to the
Attack
Research team.

Abstract:

The project&#8217;s goal is to assist penetration testers in exploiting web
application
and web service weaknesses. Because exploitation of applications is rarely
point
and click and usually requires multiple steps, network exploitation
frameworks
often fall short of the goal. The framework is intended to assist attackers
along
their exploitation journey. During this talk we will preview the new
graphical
interface for the first time and demonstrate how it changes or enhances the
reasons you may wish to try wXf.

Who then shall I fear?
