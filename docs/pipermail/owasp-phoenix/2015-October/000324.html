<PRE>Dear *Owasp-phoenix Subscribers,*

I'm happy to announce our next OWASP Phoenix chapter meeting, which will be
held at Early Warning on Thursday, November 05, 2015.  Joe Giron will be
presenting on Reverse Engineering Malware for Newbies.

I apologize again for the long badging process, I have been assured that
for those of you that have already been through the temp badge process, it
will much faster this time.  Even further, if you RSVP through the meetup
site, I will ask for your badge to be pre-printed.

Notably, this date worked out best for our speaker's schedule.  I hope that
the day and venue allows members to attend that had schedule or location
challenges.  I'm sure this also created conflicts for some of you, so
apologies, and we look forward to having you join us at future meetings.

Regards, Joaquin

If you use Meetup.com, please RSVP so that I know how many potential
attendees we might have.  <A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/owasp-phoenix">http://www.meetup.com/owasp-phoenix</A>
