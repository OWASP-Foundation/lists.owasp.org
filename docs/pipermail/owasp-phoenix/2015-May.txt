Joaquin and others,

Tuesdays are going to be bad for me, including this week, and ultimately,
forever. Excited about reviving the chapter and hope to see other events,
or other days of the week where events will be switched to or planned for.

A few years ago when the chapter was AWESOME (thanks to Pete R, Andrew W,
etc), Skyler B couldn't attend on Tuesdays, which left a gap in our
community. If I do end up becoming a similar gap -- I hope that others rise
to the occasion and attend these excellent networking and learning
opportunities afforded to you by the OWASP community.

See, now I'm really mad that I can't come with my Apple Watch. Had so many
questions about the WatchKit apps (watch-side) and extensions
(iDevice-side), especially around InterfaceController.swift,
awakeWithContext, labels, and image/table views. It makes me wonder if the
model presentation mode will be subject to UI redress attacks -- especially
with the rich Notification capabilities
(WKUserNotificationInterfaceController class). Curious if the flash is
encrypted since the App Groups allow files to pass between the devices.
Last, but not least, very curious about how the Apple Watch implements NFC,
EMV, and Apple Pay -- http://security.stackexchange.com/a/86352/140

If you have time later this week, I'll be at The Stockyards for an
open-networking event hosted by Cigital, Thursday, May 7th, starting at
6PM. The address is 5009 E Washington St, Phoenix, 85034. If anyone shows,
then perhaps we can discuss hosting on-going, open-networking
professional's happy-hour OWASP events on first-of-the-month Thursdays
going forward.

Not trying to steal Joaquin's thunder, but I do like to stir up the pot
(and trying to leverage lessons learned from our past Phoenix OWASP
failings). OWASP Austin (at least when I lived there) did host two separate
events: one during the day (lunch 'n learn style) at a corporate HQ -- and
a separate, professional's happy-hour meetup at a local Irish bar. Any
thoughts or comments are welcome.

All my best,
Andre

Andre,
I like the way you think.  Great suggestions and hope I can help if necessary.  Possibly restart the phxbsides group too.

All, 

I?m excited as well. I just recently joined the group and saw (and heard from someone else) that the status of the group was unknown, possibly defunct or getting there, so I?m happy to see some renewed energy from those interested. A brief introduction of myself ? I?ve been a software developer for 23 years, and for the past 7 years, had a small mobile app development shop in Gilbert (Big Hill Software). In 2008 I founded the Phoenix iOS Developer Group and hosted it for two years ? during which time we grew our group/list membership to over 700 and were getting around 40 people to monthly meetings around the time I handed off the reins. During that time the group got good attention / exposure from the AZ Republic, Phoenix Business Journal, and Apple themselves, as we were invited into 4 of their 5 area retail stores for demos and business workshops. All in all, that was a great ride, and it is a lot of fun to be with a user group where there?s interest and energy. 

As my career has landed me in the security area several times, I?m now ramping to begin offering security-related consulting and services, so I?ve been immersing myself in the local security community. I was at CactusCon and enjoyed it thoroughly. I am really looking forward to attending the meeting Tuesday and meeting anyone who attends. 

Cheers, 

Brad

Hello Everyone,

Just a heads up that the meeting room has changed to room #136, which is
the auditorium, still at UAT. Details have been updated on the Chapter
Page: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix.

Andre - I hear you and I completely agree with the need to mixup the dates
& possibly venues, so that folks with consistent scheduling & location
conflicts can attend.  Unfortunately I won't be able to attend Cigital's
networking event this Thursday, but entertaining a 1st Thursdays networking
event sounds like a great idea.  Let me know how those discussions go and
if there is enough interest, we should take action to make the event
official.

Sincerely,
Joaquin Fuentes

Thanks to the excellent sleuthing of Peter R, the happy-hour thing today
has been found to be postponed.

So please don't go there today.
