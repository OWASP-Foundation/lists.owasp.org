Same location as always, tomorrow at 6:30 pm

I will be sharing the research I did for the section of the upcoming  
Cloud Security Alliance mega-whitepaper/ebook that I wrote about  
vulnerabilities and cloud computing.

I'll cover:
What architectural components are particularly vulnerable
How to secure your cloud
How to select a cloud provider by understanding how much security you  
need

Afterwards - SunSec at Casey Moores

I'll update the page when I'm out of jury duty later

Even better, it would be great if PLUG would have scheduled a hacking event
at a time other than that which Phoenix OWASP has had it's scheduled meeting
for the last couple years or so.

It would be great to do some joint events with PLUG, but one of us is going
to have to change our meeting date, because this is a really bad idea given
the already limited audience for security talks in Phoenix.

No, actually, you asked that I not post events that did not include OWASP
type subjects to the list, or "top down" security!

I did not ever receive any request to not post "sister events" to the
notorious nationally open to all posts OWASP list.

Perhaps you run your Phoenix OWASP differently?  If so why?

And I did not look to see if this event conflicted with yours (what are the
chances)? I am much too busy to see if the PLUG Hackfests conflict with all
the various endeavors.  You recently changed your venue, which WAS NOT
ANNOUNCED to the list (since I didn't get notice of that either).

But if you must have one, sure, I apologize.

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] Dre speaking on Web App Sec at AZSPF tonight
Message-ID: <cb9225660911230923r67d94e4cr3940164b26bda32e@mail.gmail.com>

*Mr. RFC is cold droppin' knowledge at AZSPF this evening!

Application Security for your Average InfoSec Professional*:  At the
November '09 AZSPF meeting we will discuss Application Security.


*What:* AZ Security Practitioners ' Forum
*When:* November 23, 2009 - 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM
*Where:*  University of Advancing Technology, Baseline & I-10, Tempe
*Why:* It will be interesting.
*Presenter: *Andre Gironda
 *Topic:* Application Security for your Average InfoSec Professional
* This presentation will cover application security policy examples.
Should you have one and what goes into it? Once written, how do you go
about enacting the principles and controls behind an application
security policy? Let's talk about the best-path -- going from
application security illiterate to handling uncooperative developers,
messy source code, complex hardening & coding standards, realtime
appsec monitoring/logging, and notoriously blackhat appsec
pen-testing.*
** *Bio:*
Andre Gironda is an independent security researcher involved mostly in
web application security projects. His contributions include work on
the OWASP Top Ten 2007, OWASP Podcast News team, and speaking
engagements at local OWASP events on topics ranging from verification
standards to problems with trusting the same-origin policy. Andre has
worked for a number of companies in risk management,
security-qa-developer, and network testing roles, including labs deep
within Cisco Systems as well as many years in an operations role at
eBay.

**


*Location: *
University of Advancing Technology
2625 W Baseline Rd
Tempe, AZ 85283
(602) 383-8228

*Upcoming Metings:*

   -
   - December 28th, 2009 - NO MEETING - *Happy Holidays!*
   - January 25th, 2008 - TBD - *Suggestions/Volunteers Welcome*
