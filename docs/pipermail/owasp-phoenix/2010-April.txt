All,

Apologies for the late email, however we are in fact still planning on
meeting tomorrow.  Erik Peterson from Veracode will be coming to
discuss "*Protecting
Your Applications from Backdoors: How to Secure Your Business Critical
Applications from Time Bombs, Backdoors & Data".  *This should be a really
great opportunity to learn!

*Additionally, tomorrow's meeting is going to be held at:

*
*University of Advanced Technology in Tempe.
*
*2625 W. BASELINE RD.
TEMPE, AZ 85283-1056 *
*
*Going forward, this will be our new location for meetings.  I'd like to
personally thank Barry from Executrain who was graciously letting us use the
previous facility.

There are lots of other updates to talk about, but the largest by far is
that Adam is moving out of the state and a few of us are picking up the
responsibility of helping lead this group in the future.  Adam has done a
great job of the last few years with growing this group and we are going to
miss him around the valley.  He is moving (and may have already moved) to
NYC.  Pete Roalofs will be taking over as the lead contact for the Phoenix
chapter going forward (though you can also ping me for any questions).

Finally we are intending on continuing our tradition of drinks afterwords.
Given the new venue we are still investing the best place to imbibe.  We
should have more details tomorrow.

Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] May 4th meeting
Message-ID: <k2z9dbb46901004191157sc07233f7ra03006714710ef0f@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Hope your almost summer is starting out well!  I wanted to quickly update
everyone on next month's meeting.  The topic will be:

*Redefining & Understanding Security Posture"* *Andrew Wilson*, (me)

One of the unfortunate realities of any industry is buzzword bingo. We often
take terms and throw them around because they sound cool, but generally
without any actual or well understood meaning. Security posture is one of
those terms, that while rather popular, isn't really used in a well defined
and functional fashion

This presentation will help better outline:

   - What is posture & why is it important
   - How can be used to gain advantage, how can it be used against people
   - How does that have valuable meaning as it relates to the security
   industry.


The meeting will be held at:

6:30 PM - 7:30 PM, for about 1 hour
University of Advancing Technology 2625 W. BASELINE RD. TEMPE, AZ 85283-1056


Drinks will be found afterword at Doc & Eddies.

Doc & Eddy's, 909 East Minton Drive, Tempe, AZ 85282-7021
-

I have updated the site with the details, and will be putting last month's
presentation up shorty at http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix
