<PRE>Hello Everyone,

 

I hope everyone had a great holiday and a happy New Years.  I am really

Agenda

 6:30 to 6:45 News &amp; Introductions

 6:45 to 7:45 (1 hour): <A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-phoenix">Data at Risk</A> - Brian Christian

 

<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-phoenix">Data at Risk</A> - Protecting Web Applications Throughout the Development Lifecycle
from Hackers 


In September 2006, Mitre released statistics revealing that Web application
security issues had claimed the top three spots for the most prevalent
vulnerabilities being discovered in open source and commercial software. As
evidenced by the growing number of corporate scandals that have occurred due
to confidential data being accessed via Web hacks, securing public and
private Web applications and Web services is now a top priority for many in
the application development lifecycle. 

 

This session will define what Web application security is and why it is
needed throughout the entire development lifecycle. We will discuss common
vulnerabilities in the Web application layer and why they are so easily
exploited. This session demonstrates how to defend against common attacks at
the Web application layer with examples covering Web application hacking
methods such as SQL Injection, Blind SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting
(XSS), Parameter Manipulation, etc. We will also review how compliance and
regulatory legislation such as PCI, GLBA, HIPAA, CASB 1386, and
Sarbanes-Oxley, etc. specifically relates to and affects Web application
security. Additionally, we will examine how security throughout the
development lifecycle is essential to the security of Web application code
and the protection of proprietary data.
