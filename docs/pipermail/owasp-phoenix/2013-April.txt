Hello OWASP Phoenix,

My name is Jim Manico, I'm the jerk who canceled meeting with your
chapter because I am in Malaysia right now for work.

I emailed Pete about this a month ago, but it was my responsibility to
follow up with this - not Pete's.

I'm VERY sorry for canceling.

Please let me make this up to you. I'll at least sponsor food and drink
(something crazy nice) next meeting and will come up with a secret
surprise when I do visit.

My sincere apologies for this. I will make it up to you.

Aloha,
Jim Manico
@Manicode

PS: What if we fly the entire Phoenix chapter to Hawaii and have the
meeting there? Just thinking out loud....

Hello Pete,

I have spoken with Jim who will be in town May 20 through May 24.
Will any of those dates work for a Phoenix chapter meeting?


Cheers,

Dennis

Agreed, the Monday, the 20th seems to be a much better night to me as 
well, particularly since it is held in Tempe...

Folks,

I'm in Malaysia right now looking at my calendar from that time zone. Doh.

Here is when I'm really free "Phoenix time".

* May 24
* June 7
* First three weeks of July

Sorry again folks. Could any of these times work? I know Friday is normally a bad day for an OWASP meeting, but I'm willing.

Aloha,
Jim
