All,

Two quick updates:

   1. In case my last email was unclear, we are meeting tonight at Terra
   Lever.  Scott is presenting on application security practices.  Andre is
   going to give a brief intro to OWASP as well.
   2. Scott also wanted to announce he was giving away an autographed copy
   of the new metasploit book from no-starch.  It does not come with free
   hugs, but it's a cool and somewhat rare item none the less.

Parking on mill can be annoying, and terra lever isn't always as obvious as
it could be.  For navigation purposes, terra lever is on the 2nd level of
what I believe is a bank-- directly across the street from starbucks.
 There is only one starbucks on mill, so it should make an easy navigation
point.  I will hang outside to route people in as needed.
