*Room: 206/207 *
Title: *Hacking Smart Safes: On the "Brink" of a Robbery*
Presenter(s): *Dan ?AltF4? Petro, Oscar Salazar*
Have you ever wanted to crack open a safe full of cash with nothing but a
USB stick? Now you can! The Brink?s CompuSafe cash management product line
provides a ?smart safe as a service? solution to major retailers and fast
food franchises. They offer end-to-end management of your cash,
transporting it safely from your storefront safe to your bank via armored
car.
During this talk, we?ll uncover a major flaw in the Brink?s CompuSafe and
demonstrate how to crack one open in seconds flat. All you need is a USB
stick and a large bag to hold all of the cash. We?ll discuss how to
remotely takeover the safe with full administrator privileges, and show how
to enumerate a target list of other major Brink?s CompuSafe customers
(exposed via configuration files stored right on the safe).
At any given time, up to $240,000 can be sitting in each of the 14,000
Brink?s CompuSafe smart safes currently deployed across the United States -
potentially billions of dollars just waiting to be stolen.
We will also release a USB Rubber Ducky script to automate the whole
attack, acting as a skeleton key that can open any Brink?s safe. Plug and
plunder!
So come ready to engage us as we explore these tools and more in this DEMO
rich presentation. And don?t forget to call Kenny Loggins? because this
presentation is your highway to the Danger Zone?
