Subject: [Owasp-phoenix] OWASP Phoenix - No meeting April
Message-ID: <CAAGZWYmv93oGh+054kahSKykdHQLhxKuSuW8NpKoiEQMjB4uTg@mail.gmail.com>

There is no meeting this month. The last few months have flew by and we
missed a few meetings. OWASP Phoenix still has a lot of great support from
the community and we will keep the group going. If you would like to
present an AppSec or WebApp topic or know someone who would please contact
us.


Cheers,
Pete Roalofs
Phoenix OWASP

  "Cool" Vulnerabilities

   Lonnie Benavides


Web application management software is often overlooked and can contain
critical vulnerabilities.  This talk will focus on four different
publically known vulnerabilities within Adobe Cold Fusion.  Exploitation of
these issues results in a complete compromise of the underlying web server.
 Live demonstrations will be provided.

Lonnie Benavides is a penetration tester and the lead of the Boeing Red
Team.  Lonnie has been pen testing since 2003 when he joined an Air Force
Red Team based out of McChord Air Force Base in Washington State.  He has
taken over military bases, aircraft, and banks.  Lonnie and his family
relocated from Seattle to Phoenix in February.



Drinks will be found afterward at Doc & Eddies.
