*logDirectoryNotFoundException* is thrown if log directory specified by the
configuration doesn't exist. what's more advisable -
1. throw exception, so that developer fix it while development itself?
2. attempt to create that directory! and throw exception if it doesn't have
access?

I would say option #2 is reasonable. Just make sure you create the
directory & any log files in it with secure permissions. E.g. read/write by
owner, read-only for group, and no permissions for 'world' (i.e., other).
If that fails, throw an exception with a suitable error message.
