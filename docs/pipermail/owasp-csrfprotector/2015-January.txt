Subject: [Owasp-csrfprotector] Help with CSRF Protector php
Message-ID: <CADCpCki5TXBCiFbjpYPhARj+MrPK0DYhDJ6xDREsoNVPQ3F0hA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Christophe Deliens, suggested a method to deal with {case of token expiry}
in CSRF Protector - php. And we had a small discussion about its
implementation at github issue:
https://github.com/mebjas/CSRF-Protector-PHP/issues/5
Could you suggest your suggestion on this?

Thanks!
