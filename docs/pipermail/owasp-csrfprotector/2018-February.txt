Subject: [Owasp-csrfprotector] [Introduction][GSoC 2018] CSRF Protector -
 Python Package for Flask and ExpressJS middleware
Message-ID: <CA+2yA01dddLBG4hkHaCKUByoECp7=+zkhZN6MqMk5T-MR2fX0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am Pushpitha Dilhan from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. I am studying
Computer Science and Engineering and now in my final year. I am interested
in the project idea "OWASP CSRF Protector - Extending the design as a
python package to work with Flask and an Express JS (Node.JS) middleware"
for Google Summer of Code 2018. I have three years experience in Python and
1 year experience in Flask. I have a good experience on network secuirty
also. Here is my current progress,

   - cloned the repository for Flask package [1]
   - Studied the architecture [2][3][4]
   - studying OWASP wiki on CSRF [5][6]
   - working on Python package first

I would like to know anymore resources that would be useful in this
project.

Hi Pushpitha,
It great to know about your interest. And I see you have already made some
progress which is awesome.

Implementation of python and js version of csrf protector need to be done
later as a part of GSOC if OWASP is selected as a mentoring org and this
project is selected.

However, if you are interested a good starting point towards contribution
would be js fixes. There are some open issues on Github. I am more than
open to help.

Regards,
Minhaz
