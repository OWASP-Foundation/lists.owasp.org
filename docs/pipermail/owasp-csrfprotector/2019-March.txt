Hi everyone,
You might have already received mails indicating OWASP moving from mailman
to Google Groups.

As a part of the efforts I request you to join the group -
https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/csrfprotector-project if
you are still interested in discussions and announcements.


Kind Regards,
Minhaz
