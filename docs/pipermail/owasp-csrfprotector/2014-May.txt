Subject: [Owasp-csrfprotector] protection for GET requests
Message-ID: <CADCpCkg=S1==UcNjSPVKXkz=cnYsQQMsMmF2DixuSgb14LbxVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
We had our discussions on whether we should support CSRF protection for GET
requests. And currently we are providing a configurable option for
developers to enable support for GET, and validation will be done for those
requests that contain query parameters with default action be (strip
cookies and forward the request).

We cannot enable validation for all GET requests directly, as this will
lead to many false negatives. But GET based CSRF attacks can be as
dangerous as well.

What if we keep a list of specific urls for which developer want to check
for CSRF validation in GET requests, this would create no false positive or
false negative. As GET requests to only certain urls can be vulnerable. If
developer can identify this, we can map every host url in request, with
list the developer has maintained and provide validation for those only.
But this will complicate the logic to certain extend, but we can implement
this!

Great idea, I like it.

A list is not the best idea, but a function that returns true or false and is implemented by the developer is a totally different story!

What if the application uses dynamic URLs? What if it has so many URLs that need to be verified, and only one not to be verified?

We can expect the develoepr to create a function that receives a URL, and returns true if it needs to be CSRF protected and false otherwise, and then use that function to decide what to do.

A list can easily be implemented using that as well.

Yeah this is a better idea, rather than implementing the logic directly
into the validation code,
we can provide a function which can be overridden by user defined function.
In basic method we can provide mechanism that is in our scope i.e to map
the current request url with all mentioned in array of urls to be validated.

Also this would require us to rewrite only requests (in case of GET) which
are sent to these urls be rewritten,  or we rewrite every url as having an
extra parameter in the request url won't be harmful (but I guess that would
be a very bad practise)

For this we need to pass the logic to js also, so that it identifies which
request to rewrite, any simple idea on how to do this?

Minhaz,

Did you ever set up a Doodle to try to find a couple of times
that we could all actually sit down and talk together about your
GSoC project? I know you are taking your final exams until
the first week of June or so, but the farther in advance that people
can make plans, in general the better it will be for all of us.

Thanks,

Sorry for delay!
I have created one for tomorrow. Lets see if others' can make it, else I'll
make one with broader timeline.

I have set invitation to you, Jim and Abbas. link to doodle, just for
reference: http://doodle.com/qatfyvtk33a8umxxtt6cfb8b

So I guess 9 pm to 11pm IST (11:30am to 1:30pm) would be good for today.
Where shall we meet? irc, gtalk, or hangout?

Wait a moment... as far as I could tell, those times listed were converted
to local time. I didn't realize they were in IST. I didn't see anything
indicating them as such. 9-11:00pm IST is right in the middle of my
employer's work day so I can't take that time off unless I typically have a
week's notice.

So, I won't be able to make it today.  Could you propose some other times
instead?

Thanks,

-kevin

Oh its ok with me, just suggest any time you will be off today, I'll be up
that time! Since you and Abbas are on same timezone, he'll be able to make
it.

If you interpret the times I picked in Doodle as US/Eastern (EDT), those
are times I'm available today. Find something that works for you & Abbas
and we'll go from there.

I'd suggest using Google Hangout but Skype will work too.

My Skype id is kwwall-esapi if you want to go that route...just let me know
in advance since I'm normally not logged into there.

Hi,
I did implementation of this part in another branch of the repo
in configuration I used, regex like:
https://github.com/mebjas/CSRF-Protector-PHP/blob/GET-support/libs/config.php#L17

in the library I have used functions to check if we need to validate
current GET request for CSRF attack:
https://github.com/mebjas/CSRF-Protector-PHP/blob/GET-support/libs/csrf/csrfprotector.php#L364

This function can be overridden by the developer and thus developer can
easily develop the protocol to check if the request should be validated for
a GET request or not, otherwise use one provided with CSRFP.

I'd like to know, how do you think about this mechanism?

Jim,

> Jim "The Bad Mentor" Manico

I hereby give you my previous "working title" for the past 2 years of
GSoC mentoring... you are now a tor-mentor. :)

This of course implies that you will now have to live up to that
title and harass Minhaz, and of course, in addition, you must use
also use Tor to communicate through any IRC, Google Hangout,
or Skype conversation we hold.

I could not think of a good configuration name for this field, where user
maintain url/regex of those pages for which CSRF validation (GET) is
supposed to be done. Available at:
https://github.com/mebjas/CSRF-Protector-PHP/blob/GET-support/libs/config.php#L17


suggest me one, *verifyGetFor *doesn't look good as a parameter name :O

Just call it "protectGet" or something similar. :)

Also not all POST need CSRF protection:  a public comment form, a public 
registration form, or login do not need tokens.

since CSRF attacks are basically meant for, logged in users, so the
developer will include the library and initiate it only for those pages. So
I don't think we need to keep another list for POST?
