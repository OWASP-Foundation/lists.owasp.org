Hi Manisha,
If it's a PHP application you can use CSRF Protector PHP -
https://github.com/mebjas/CSRF-Protector-PHP

Here's the wiki on how to use it:
https://github.com/mebjas/CSRF-Protector-PHP/wiki

Alternatively, we have an Apache Module for Apache 2.2.x. However, it's not
well maintained so I wont recommend that.

Thanks,
Minhaz
