<PRE>True Office &lt;<A HREF="http://www.trueoffice.com/">http://www.trueoffice.com/</A>&gt; is a company that leverages mobile
apps to turn compliance testing into a game-like experience in an effort to
make mandatory training less tedious to employees. The app has the look and
feel of a computer game but provides employees with training on topics
things like sexual harassment and compliance.

Instead of reading boring documents or watching corporate videos,
&#8220;training&#8221; can now be completed in 15 minutes of gameplay. Employers can
measure the progress of players, and the app is compatible with both iOS
and Android apps and can be played on any computer hooked up to the web.
Training games can also be customized based on a corporation&#8217;s needs.

By 2014, 47% of the US workforce will be
millennials&lt;<A HREF="http://www.psfk.com/2011/05/psfk-conference-nyc-2011-aaron-dignan-video.html">http://www.psfk.com/2011/05/psfk-conference-nyc-2011-aaron-dignan-video.html</A>&gt;.
True Office leverages the preferences of this younger generation through
gamification. While the CEO of True Office Adam Sodowick admits that
training may never be fun, he does think a gaming aspect is more memorable
than flicking through a flash-based lesson or conventional presentation. In
an interview with the *Sunday
Times&lt;<A HREF="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/Appointments/article834482.ece">http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/Appointments/article834482.ece</A>&gt;
*, Sodowick explained:

Two things underpin our approach. The first is that playing games engages
people in solving problems and motivates them to do it. Alongside that is
the story-telling aspect, which improves people&#8217;s recall of what they
learn. So we can take something dry about insider trading or Sarbanes-Oxley
[American accounting regulations] and slip that into a game, a story, and
we know that people are much more likely to remember it than with other
forms of training.
