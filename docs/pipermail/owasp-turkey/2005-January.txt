Subject: [Owasp-turkey] OWASP Turkey local chapter
Message-ID: <0e8a01c4fdd3$609dfd30$0464a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>

Hi,

Can someone on the list let me know who is leading the OWASP Turkey local 
chapter?  There is a mailing list, but no web page on the OWASP portal.  The 
chapter leaders are getting organized and starting to share materials and 
ideas.

Thanks!

--Jeff
