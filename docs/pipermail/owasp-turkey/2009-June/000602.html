In exactly one year -- June 21-24, 2010 -- we'll all meet in beautiful
Stockholm, Sweden. OWASP Sweden, Norway, and Denmark hereby invite you to
OWASP AppSec Research 2010.

 

AppSec Research = AppSec Europe

This conference was formerly known as OWASP AppSec Europe. We have added
'Research' to highlight that we invite both industry and academia. All the
regular AppSec Europe visitors and topics are welcome along with
contributions from universities and research institutes.

 

This is the European conference for anyone interested in or working with
application security. Co-host is the Department of Computer and Systems
Science at Stockholm University, offering a great venue in the fabulous Aula
Magna.

 

Countdown Challenges -- Free Tickets to Win!

There will be a challenge posted on the conference wiki page the 21st every
month up until the event. The winner will get free entrance to the
conference. What are you waiting for? The first challenge is posted. Go, go,
go --
