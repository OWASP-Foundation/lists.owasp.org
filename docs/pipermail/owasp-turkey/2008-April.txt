OWASP Dinner (May 21)
At every conference we have an evening social event the first night. They are always fun and allow participants to have some unstructured time to mingle with the other attendees. This year's event will be a Flemish buffet with special Belgian beers at the Monasterium (near the conference location).
 
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a worldwide free and open community focused on improving the security of application software. Our mission is to make application security "visible," so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about application security risks.

Hope to see you all in May!
 
Regards
 
Sebastien
