Hi,

A reminder that tomorrow at 3:00pm we will be meeting in our new location
at the Brass Ring (701 E Washington Ave, Madison, WI 53703 ). There is a
parking lot behind the building.

Our cash situation has been fixed and we will once again be providing some
snacks during the meeting.

I hope to everyone there.

Thanks,
Lance Rudolph
