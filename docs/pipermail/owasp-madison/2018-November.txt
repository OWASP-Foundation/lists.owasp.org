Subject: [Owasp-madison] Meeting next week tuesday
Message-ID: <CAGmb4zZ67eq+Zd7W6M2F+-aUBH8a482gAJ+B8KzwhDZWLg3UsQ@mail.gmail.com>

This week has gone fast.  I should have gotten this out earlier, but better
late than never.  We will meet next week Tuesday for the last meeting of
the year.  It will be a holiday hacking challenge day with good and drinks
provided by the group.  Come and help us work through the challenge.  We
will also brainstorm ideas for future meetings so that we can have a good
2019.  Come and have fun with us.

On a personal note if anyone knows of any summer internships for my son let
me know.

Lance
