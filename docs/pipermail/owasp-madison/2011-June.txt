All,

We hope you'll be able to join us in Minneapolis to celebrate the 10th year
of OWASP at AppSec USA.  

 

YOUR LIFE IS IN THE CLOUD

 

Are you afraid to look at your mobile apps and cloud deployments for fear of
what you'll find? It's been a tough year in security, and mobility and cloud
computing are placing a serious strain on already overburdened software
development and security departments.

  

Get over your fears, and avoid becoming yet another entry in the breach log.
Send your developers and security team to OWASP AppSec USA 2011, Minneapolis
Convention Center this September 20-23!  

 

Training at AppSec

 

Sign up for mobile security, penetration testing, secure coding, and attack
detection and response courses being held September 20-21. Group discounts
are available.
