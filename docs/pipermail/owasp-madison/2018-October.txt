Reminder that Tuesday we will be meeting at the Brass Rail. I hope everyone
can make it.  We are starting a hour later than normal, so I will see you
all at 4:00pm.

Please note that I had the name wrong we are at he Brass Ring, not the
Brass Rail.  A slip of the name from my old college days in LaCrosse, sorry
about that.
