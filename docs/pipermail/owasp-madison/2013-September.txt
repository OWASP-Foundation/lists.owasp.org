Good morning!

Our team is developing an assurance tool and software testing platform that is open to all and no-cost. We want to be a critical resource for the open source community for vulnerability testing and reporting. Our website is www.cosalab.org<http://www.cosalab.org/> (we'll have a new and improved site soon). We are housed in the Morgridge Institute for Research and partner with UI-Champaign/Urbana and Indiana University.

We are looking for open source tool developers, researchers and software developers to beta test our platform. If interested, please get in touch!
