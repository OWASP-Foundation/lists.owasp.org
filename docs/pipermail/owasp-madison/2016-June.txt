Subject: [Owasp-madison] Looking to help sponsor OWASP Madison
Message-ID: <1D879896749E3249AF7A43BD1532C48207FBAB84E9@agexhsvr.agcompanies.employs.com>

Hello all,
I have been in OWASP for about two years now and am a big believer of this international community. I have recently left Application Security consulting to taken over and Cofound Identify Recruiting an AppSec staffing company. I would like to help sponsor and find other corporate sponsors with the purpose of reinvigorating the Madison OWASP chapter.  Anyone interested in rebooting Madison with me? If so let me know.

Thank you!

Joel

Subject: [Owasp-madison] Sconnie OWASP Madison Chapter - answers
Message-ID: <1D879896749E3249AF7A43BD1532C48207FBAB8997@agexhsvr.agcompanies.employs.com>

Hi All,

Thank you all so much for your emails and questions about why I sent yesterday's email about my interest in rebooting the OWASP Madison. To answer your questions, my aim is simple:  to help foster a strong Sconnie AppSec community. As one of the past cofounders of gener8tor, investing in early stage companies, I have seen the continuous stream of innovation come out of Madison's eco system. At gener8tor our model was/is to invest in scalable SaaS, Web, Mobile and IoT business models. I saw firsthand the need for AppSec & Secure Software Design and Architectures.

Furthermore, companies are moving to a DevOps model, which ultimately means moving to quality code at an agile pace. In speaking and working with my Fortune clients, most AppSec departments have to now move at the speed of their DevOps customers so they don't become another choke point. One of the biggest problems for AppSec departments is the lack of AppSec talent that can both build and break software. In this market, it's easier to take a builder or a software engineer and cross train them to become a more productive Application Security engineer & architect.

Finally, since I am not a hands on practitioner, but a high quality service provider, I don't feel it would be appropriate for me to run the Sconnie Chapter. I do not have the necessary expertise, credibility or certifications to legitimize this group.

What I can and want to do is help with funding, corporate connections, and relevant speakers to help Sconnie OWASP grow and thrive as a top notch organization.

Thank you all again for your emails and if other people have more questions or are interested please let me know.

Have a wonderful 4th of July!!!

Joel


Thank you!

Joel
