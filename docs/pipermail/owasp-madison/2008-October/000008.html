<PRE>
Didn't get a chance to see Jeff William's talk about the OWASP ESAP at  
the last NYC OWASP Conference?
Don't want to watch the video online but rather see him live and be  
able to ask questions? Here is your chance!

You're invited to attend the 1st ever MN OWASP Conference on October  
21st. We're very excited
out the line up of internationally known speakers we were able to  
bring together for this one day
of Application Security talks. Speakers such as:

Jeff Williams - OWASP Chair,
Richard Stallman - President of Free Software Foundation,
Brian Chess - CEO Fortify Software,
Anil Kuma - Security Architect for Microsoft Security Team

Just to mention a few. The local MN OWASP chapter is hosting this  
event which we've
brought to you at a nominal fee of $25.00 per person which includes  
lunch. Seating is limited and
we expect this event to sell out. On site registration the day of the  
event is not expected to be
available so please register prior to the event to guarantee your seat  
at this event.
