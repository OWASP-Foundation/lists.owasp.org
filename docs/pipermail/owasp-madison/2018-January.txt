Everyone,

We are still on for the meeting Jan 31st at Sprechers.  I will get the
website updated tonight.

The tentative Agenda is:
1) Meltdown and Spectre
2) CryptoMining Attacks (UW seems to have been hit - anyone know details
they can share?)
3) Some Security Shepherd

Hope to everyone there.

Thanks,
Lance Rudolph
