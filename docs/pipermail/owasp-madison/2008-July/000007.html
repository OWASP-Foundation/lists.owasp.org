<PRE>Hi all,

I can't recall if I ever replied to Brian's message so here goes just in
case:

1. I do not live and/or work in Madison, I live and/or work in Milwaukee.
2. For the last 2-3 years I've done IT audit, with a focus on infosec, for a
large, global, industrial automation company. For the five years prior I did
webappsec, almost exclusively, for a few large financial institutions. For
the six years prior to that, I did general infosec and intelligence work for
the NSA and Naval Security Group.
3. I guess I'm 'intermediate' at webappsec--that seems like the safe answer.
:<i>-)
</I>4. I'd prefer the latter three out of the four activity levels mentioned
below. I was active in the DC chapter in 2004-2005 before relocating to
Wisconsin. We met almost every month and there was always somebody from the
chapter willing to give a short talk/presentation and/or lead a discussion
on something webappsec related. Aspect Security was our sponsor and they
usually supplied geek food which was nice, not to mention an area to meet
in.

I'm interested in hearing from other people who do webappsec in
Wisconsin...or even infosec in general...

Matt

List members,

I have asked to be facilitator for the OWASP-Madison list, and OWASP
has granted me that request.  The site says we have 16 members.  The
archives say we've had a couple of SPAM messages, and that's it.

Please consider this a opportunity to introduce yourselves to the 15
others on the list.  It would be good to know some basics:

 --&gt; If you live and/or work in Madison,

 --&gt; What you do as work (or play if that's more relevant),

 --&gt; What is your level of experience with web application security
        _ beginner
        _ intermediate
        _ advanced

 --&gt; What level of activity would you prefer from the OWASP-Madison chapter:
        _ none at all
        _ use list for local sounding board
        _ periodic physical meetings
        _ giving demonstrations or presentations

If you'll reply to me, I'll collate the results and distribute them
back to you off-list.  Thanks all for your feedback!
