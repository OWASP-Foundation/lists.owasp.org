Subject: [Owasp-madison] February Meeting
Message-ID: <CAGmb4zZQAUQWVRu4RLdbneOprU1HQ5Q4HQmvcQ1pq8s=NwrEew@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I am just awaiting the official confirmation form Sprecher's that we have a
room, but we still plan to meet on the 28th.  I will get an agenda out as
soon as I confirm.

Thanks,
Lance Rudolph

All,

We have lost our meeting place, sprecher's is closing the location we were
using. I am scrambling to find a spot for us.  I am hoping the brinks
lounge will have us.  I hope to know later today.

Lance
