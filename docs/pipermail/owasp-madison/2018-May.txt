good meeting.  We will have Drew talking about Dependency checker and
Jeremy talking abut Blockchain.  See you all at the Brass Rail.

All,

One last meeting before the heat of summer hits us.  We are getting
together next Tuesday at 3:00PM at the Brass Ring on East Washington.  We
will work through some more Security Shepard challenges, and spend some
time sharing stories about the month in security.
