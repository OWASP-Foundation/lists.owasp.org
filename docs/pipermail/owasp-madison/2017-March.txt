Hello Madison OWASP!

I am Lance Rudolph, and I am starting the meetings again and am excited to
announce a start to regular meetings again.

I have set up a meeting on 4/26/2017 3:00PM - 5:00PM at
Sprecher's
1262 John Q. Hammons Dr.
Madison, WI

The agenda for the first meeting will be the following:
1) a demonstration of ZAP (bring a PC that can run a VM to follow along)
2) discussion of what future topics people would like to have
3) Time to get to know each other

I have a few ideas for future topics to get your creative ideas flowing.
A demonstration on how to do your own a buffer overflow attack
Rust the Programming language
How to Pen Test an Android application

Please spread the word, everyone is encouraged to come.  I want to have a
meeting that is welcoming to people that are just starting their careers,
to those who are well seasoned.  We can all get together and learn from
each other.  I hope to see you there.

-- 
Thanks,
Lance Rudolph
