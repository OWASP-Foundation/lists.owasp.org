Subject: [Owasp-madison] members of OWASP-Madison chapter
Message-ID: <E1JIXUM-0003cR-8l@fenris.runbox.com>

List members,

I have asked to be facilitator for the OWASP-Madison list, and OWASP has granted me that request.  The site says we have 16 members.  The archives say we've had a couple of SPAM messages, and that's it.

Please consider this a opportunity to introduce yourselves to the 15 others on the list.  It would be good to know some basics:

 --> If you live and/or work in Madison,

 --> What you do as work (or play if that's more relevant),

 --> What is your level of experience with web application security
        _ beginner
        _ intermediate
        _ advanced

 --> What level of activity would you prefer from the OWASP-Madison chapter:
        _ none at all
        _ use list for local sounding board
        _ periodic physical meetings
        _ giving demonstrations or presentations

If you'll reply to me, I'll collate the results and distribute them back to you off-list.  Thanks all for your feedback!
