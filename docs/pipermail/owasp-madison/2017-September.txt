We are back after the summer and have a great meeting planned for Sept 27th
at 3:00PM at Sprecher's on the west side.

Drew will be presenting some interesting results from a penetration test.
Todd has also found some a good hardening guide for IIS, and we will share
that.

Hope to see everyone there.

Thanks,
