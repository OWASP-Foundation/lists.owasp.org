Owaspers,

We will be getting together on the first Tuesday of February at the Brass
Ring on East Washington.  I have not yet nailed down the agenda, but it
will either be a walk through of one of the lessons in the program that the
professors talk about a few months ago or it will be going through the
options that are available for learning about security issues.  We have
several that members have tried, and we will go through the period and cons
of several of them.

Another talk that I am working on is getting a person who is building the
learning exercises for the UW to show us how they do it.  I'd you have any
ideas for future presentations let me know, especially if you are
interested in leasing the discussion.


Lance

Subject: [Owasp-madison] February Meeting (2/5/2019)

All,

We will be starting our meetings for 2019 next week. Next week we will have
Jon who has gone through Professor Bart Miller's secure coding course lead
us through a few of the exercises in the course.  All the materials for
this course are publicly accessible, so we will show how you can use them
to study up on these topics on your own.  I do think it will be more
rewarding to go through them as a group, so if others are interested, let
me know and we will add them to our agenda.

So join us next week as we learn what is taught about secure coding at the
UW. We will meet at the Brass Ring on East Washington Madison WI at 3:00 PM
- 5:00 PM.

I have a tentative plan for the rest of the spring meetings:

March (3/5/2019) We will have Evan who is working with Professor Miller to
talk about how to set up exercises, and other topics about the work he is
doing.  I figure this would be good for those of us who want to provide
exercises within our companies.

April(4/2/2019) Investigate Cyber Ranges starting with AZCWR, and others
like the juice shop form OWASP

May(5/7/2019) Return to SWAMP, learn how we can use it on an actual example
to find flaws in systems

June(6/4/2019) another round of the Secure Coding Course Topic to be
selected by the group at an earlier meeting.

I hope to see everyone there.

Thanks,
Lance Rudolph
