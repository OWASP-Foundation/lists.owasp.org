of OWASP.

What is needed to do so? We need an OWASP member? Is any OWASP member living
in Mexico?

Greetings!!

Hi everyone,

I guess the time has come to restart the meetings. I have met with several
of you in the past months and many have asked about restarting the OWASP
monthly gatherings.

Carlos Ochoa will now be stepping in as chapter leader. I have not had the
time I would have wished to continue to organize the events. Partly because
of this, but mainly because of Carlos' enthusiasm and great knowledge in
relation to Web Application Security, we have asked him to step in and get
the chapter up and running again.

I will let him organize the next meeting and communicate the suggested
schedule.

We were having the meetings in different places each month. If any of you
could share a meeting room for 20 to 30 people, please let me know off-list
so we could plan on using that space.

And we should also plan the January 2008 event SirDarckcat suggests!

Warm regards,
Victor Chapela
