hola a todos!

seguimos con las buenas noticias para la comunidad OWASP hispano parlante...
Jim Manico, quien organiza los reconocidos podcast OWASP, se ha ofrecido a
entrenar a alguien de habla hispana para poder generar podcasts en espa?ol!

por lo tanto, si te interesaria ser la 'voz' de OWASP en espa?ol mandame un
correo electronico cuanto antes.

saludos,

Fabio Cerullo

This is a fantastic idea. I will gladly add Spanish podcasts to the current
series on it's own private feed, and send it through the mastering process
that I use for the current series.

We just need to find a Spanish host and someone to help edit the file before
it's sent to me to review and master.

I'll be glad to train that person about audio and skype recording.

OWASP pays 100$ USD to get each show mastered. Recording and editing the
show is by volunteers.

If you find a volunteer to host and edit the Spanish show, the mastering
will be free - or at least paid for by OWASP.

Our mastering guy is Mexican and speaks Spanish, btw. :)

hi Jim,

I was wondering if it would be possible to run a series of podcasts in
spanish...

this is part of the OWASP Spanish community plan to present a SoC Marketing
project in order to leverage the spanish community.

so here are my questions:

1) would you like to do it, or do you know someone who would be willing to
host "spanish" podcast sessions?
2) what type of technology is required?
3) are there any costs associated?

thanks!
