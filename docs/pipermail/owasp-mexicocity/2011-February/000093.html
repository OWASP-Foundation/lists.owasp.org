<PRE>Hello to both and welcome to the group.

I started the group six years back and we had some interesting meetings at the beginning. This group has been almost without activity for a few years now.

We have had a problem getting this group started for several reasons, the main one being similar to what you stated. In our initial meetings a few years back, most of the interaction was one sided. There were programmers or security folks that wanted a free web hacking course and had nothing to contribute nor share.

Then a couple of years back there was genuine interest in getting the group meetings started again. We had a meeting but only five persons showed up and I did not feel compelled to follow up as I should.

I personally have very little time now a days, but we could try to have an informal meeting with all those interested and share experience and get to know each other. There are now many more Web Security Ninjas in Mexico City than what we had six years back. We may be ready.

But it does have to be community driven. If it depends on one person being motivated to bring everyone together, then in my experience it will not work.

I suggest we set a date next week and meet at a Starbucks one evening. Get to know each other and chat. We can talk about our common interests and find a way to channel some of them through this group. If that does not work we will at least make a friend or two with similar interests or ideas.

Who's in? 

Victor

Hi there,

I'm gonna do the same. Personally, I have the feeling that people here don't really bother or worry about socializing or exchange in the IT field (but I am new to DF and I might be totally wrong). But the fact that there isn't even a PHP Usergroup in the worlds' second largest city speaks for itself.

In the end is not a bad thing, if there are no coders that contribute, there's no justification/need for such a group.

Since there's not much request for meetings, I'd suggest to use other events like Barcamps (I noticed there have been some web-related events at the Telmex Hub in Downtown) for our purposes.

Bests,

Erik P&#246;hler
