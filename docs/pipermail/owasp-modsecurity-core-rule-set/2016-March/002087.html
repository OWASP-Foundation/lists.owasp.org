<PRE>Hey Gary,
This Is actually a great question and should be very easily possible. Typically Basic Authentication uses base64. So you could do something similar to the following (untested)
SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:Authorization &quot;@contains admin:&quot; &quot;id:1, t:base64Decode,deny,status:403'

Subject: [Owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set] Is it possible to use modsecurity rules to prevent logins by specific user accounts?

Hi,

I have an internal Web application that uses Apache Basic Authentication, checking user account logins against an internal LDAP Server for authentication.

I am now looking to present this Web Application to whitelisted IP's on the Internet, by means of a Reverse Proxy Apache Server in a DMZ with modsecurity enabled and one of the free rulesets to protect the application being abused. Both the Reverse Proxy and the Internal Apache server are configured for https only.

It occurs to me that Administrative users should never be able to login to the Web Application from the via the Reverse Proxy Apache server - I hence wonder if it is possible to use modsecurity on the Reverse Apache server to prevent specific Admin user accounts from logging in to the Web Application?

If so, please can someone point me in the direction of how I might achieve this?

Thanks

Gary
