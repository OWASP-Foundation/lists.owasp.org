<PRE>Hi there,

I like that as a best practice. Let's put this into the OWASP
wiki as development guideline. I would not make it a formal requirement
though, but something like 90% of commits should go that way.
(There are always reasons to shortcut a process and barring that
path takes away flexibility. We just have to make sure there
are actually good reasons in these cases).

&gt;<i> I see that Christian has already started tackling some reported issues on Github, which is awesome! At some point we should make an effort to go over the old issues too. 
</I>
I closed one or two of the old ones. It would be nice if we could 
make this a community effort.

Everybody can go out and look at the open issues.
<A HREF="https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues">https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues</A>

Many of them are really simple like misinterpretations of what the
core rules are or lack of knowledge by the reporter to make a false 
positive disappear. Anybody can give the necessary infos to the
reporter. If you want to have the issue closed afterwards, just
drop me or Chaim or Walter a line.

Other issues are harder and demand a bit of testing or adjustment
of rules. If anybody has suggestions or ideas, adding to the
conversation on github and reporting here on the ML seems like
a good practice. We can then examine the proposed solution.

In the end, I think a community should keep a low number of
open issues. It looks much more welcoming that way. 

&gt;<i> Lots of them are about old CRS rules which are now gone in CRS v3. After the paranoid project has settled down, we&#8217;ll know for sure which rules are staying. I assume that CRS v2 will no longer get updates unless in exceptional cases? If so, we can communicate that. So I&#8217;ll keep this as a todo for after the paranoid rules are known.
</I>
Yep.

Cheers,

Christian
