<PRE>When I started reading Christian&#8217;s answer I was sure, I will defend my
point of view and we absolutely have to limit the firing sibling rules
to only one per request.
But when I continued reading I have to admit, that Christian has a point.

Confusing people by adding new rules, apparently at random, by
changing the paranoia level, is really not nice. That&#8217;s true.

On this point I don&#8217;t entirely agree with you, Christian:
&#8220;The higher you go. The more alerts you get and the higher the score.
This is what I would expect from a paranoia setting.&#8221;
We already have a stricter rule on a higher level. We don&#8217;t also need
a higher score, triggered by more matching rules.
I don&#8217;t like the fact, that with a higher paranoia level you get a
higher score, caused by these stricter siblings. You also don&#8217;t. That
is what you described with: &#8220;So cumulation has an unbalancing effect.&#8220;
That could mislead to raise the anomaly threshold at a higher paranoia
level. That&#8217;s dangerous.
But I also agree, that if someone chooses a higher paranoia level, he
knows what he does and will instead tune the rules.
And your approach to choose a low paranoia level, then tune and choose
a higher level also makes sense.

With our numbering scheme (incrementing last digit) we always see at a
glance which rules belong together: 9xxxx0, 9xxxx1, 9xxxx2.
That should simplify the log&#8217;s readability and If someone is familiar
with these stricter siblings he immediately understands the system and
identifies why a request was blocked.

At the end I agree with both of you. Let&#8217;s keep it simple and avoid
unnecessary complexity!

Regards,
Franziska

&gt;<i> Hi Christian,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some very good points!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with your assessment about the rule complexities. I agree that
</I>&gt;<i> keeping rules simple is extremely important, especially given our low
</I>&gt;<i> resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But of course, a real attack will trigger 3 times. And I
</I>&gt;<i> do not mind that. If there is a real attack then I am
</I>&gt;<i> very open for anomaly score to grow at great velocity. And
</I>&gt;<i> in fact that is the behaviour of the 2.2.X core rules:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is true, too. This unbalanced distribution of anomaly scores between
</I>&gt;<i> parts of the CRS is already there since CRS v2. And it&#8217;s not that big of a
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are paranoid, you should probably use 5 as your blocking threshold
</I>&gt;<i> anyway. In that case, a higher anomaly score has no difference on a blocking
</I>&gt;<i> decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In a way, it might even be useful to an admin to get the multiple rules
</I>&gt;<i> logged if they run at high paranoia level. They can instantly see all the
</I>&gt;<i> relevant rule ID&#8217;s, there is no magic, and people can simply apply their
</I>&gt;<i> whitelistings so that they also cover the lower rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I read Franziska's message, I was ready to agree. But
</I>&gt;<i> then I thought about it and I came to the conclusion, that
</I>&gt;<i> alert cumulation is not ideal, but everything else is even
</I>&gt;<i> worse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's keep it simple even if it brings a few more alerts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good characterization. Let&#8217;s keep it simple, the drawbacks of multiple
</I>&gt;<i> alerts are likely not worth the added burden of reducing them.
