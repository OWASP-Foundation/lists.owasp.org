Subject: [Owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set] OWASP CRS Version 3.0 RC1 Released
Message-ID: <20161021050738.GA9466@elias>

Dear all,

The 2nd release candidate of the upcoming 
OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set v3.0.0 
has been published.

https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc2

This RC2 addresses several reported issues and concerns from our users 
in order to yield a more usable and complete project. The changes
include:

* Further reduced false positives
* Template prebuilt exclusions for common web applications 
  (including Wordpress and Drupal)
* A critical fix for usability on Apache 2.2
* Additional documentation updates
* Performance improvements
* Fixes for potential rule bypass issues

Let me explain the template prebuilt exclusions a bit:
We reduced false positive for CRS3 by more than 90% in the default
install. But you still encounter them here and there. In order to
get rid of these false positives, you need to configure rule exclusions
for certain paths and/or parameters. That is instructions to ModSec
to exclude a path or parameter from being inspected by an individual
rule. CRS3-RC2 comes with a set of these rule exclusions for the
default installs of Wordpress and Drupal. This means, you can now
install these CMS suites, publish and consume articles without a 
single false positive. This is a brand new feature and maybe we
did not catch everything. So a few test runs would be welcome. But this
is a start. If you have ties in the Wordpress and Drupal communities, 
then please spread the word. If this is a successful method to get
Wordpress and Drupal users on board, we may look into expanding these
exclusion templates to other application packages as well.

Ideally, this RC2 is identical with the full release. If there is no
showstopper, we will either release on October 31 or in early November.

Chaim has written a blog post about this release:
https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/OWASP-ModSecurity-CRS-Version-3-0-RC2-Released

In parallel to this release, I am publishing a series of Apache /
ModSecurity tutorials at https://www.netnea.com/cms/apache-tutorials/
In the end, this will be 12 tutorials. At least. So far, the following
ones appeared:
 Tutorial 1: Compiling Apache
 Tutorial 2: Configuring a Minimal Apache Web Server
 Tutorial 3: Configuring an Apache/PHP Application Server
 Tutorial 4: Enabling Encryption with SSL/TLS
 Tutorial 5: Extending and Analyzing the Access Log
 Tutorial 6: Embedding ModSecurity

Until CRS3 is out, you will also see
 Tutorial 7: Including the CRS
 Tutorial 8: Tuning the CRS / Writing Exclusion Rules

Not that you would need to learn how to install Apache. But I do know
that the documentation on how to run the Core Rules in real life is
lacking. And I think I have a conceptual view on the issues around
CRS in production that is now ready to share. There will be methods
and scripts that greatly simplify life. Please have a look and please
share your experience.

Reports about your experience with CRS3-RC2 is something we also need.
Positive feedback is what keeps us going. Bug reports is what helps
us improve the quality of the ruleset. Please send them in.

Best regards,

Christian Folini, in the name of the Core Rules team
(Chaim Sanders, Walter Hop and me)

Hello guys.

How can I configure modsecurity to send an e-mail when match some rule? I
want something "global", for all rules.


Thanks

Hi,

I'm pretty sure that don't want to do that, 'cause it may be the source of
DOS against multiple systems (web server, mail server, mail account).

We used AuditConsole[1] at some point. It works with a model that is
similar to Sentry in the python world.

You have mlogc, a collector that gathers all modsec alerts, queues them
up and then sends them in batches to the central audit console, where
you can search and lookup all alert details, and send emails too
if that's what you *really* want :-)

Sadly AuditConsole is not updated very frequently and
it's a bit rough around the edges. If you know of any
alternatives, please do share.

Personally, I would put a fail2ban or an sec/logpp process on the
log. Both tools allow to do rate-limiting, which solves the DoS problem
(outside of the processing overhead of the said tool. logpp is
extremely fast and solves much of that problem.

Ahoj,

Christian

Dear Ilyass,

I spent half of the day thinking about what to respond to you.
The other message covered the tools to use, but how about the
integration?

There is no documentation on how to pull this off in ModSecurity
in a clean way AFAIK and I think you should integrate it
yourself. Personally, I recommend going back to the classic
expos? of Marcus Ranum about "artificial ignorance".
And from there, make your way to logpp and SEC.

A primer on ModSecurity alerting sits on my todo list for future
tutorials once the 12 part series at
https://www.netnea.com/cms/aapche-tutorials is finished. But 
this todo list is a crowded place, I am afraid. So don't wait for it.

Ahoj,

Christian

I use Splunk (https://www.splunk.com) to collect log files. I can then set up alerts based on those. Don't alert on everything (agree with Cosimo on that!) but have a dashboard of web server healthiness (of which ModSecurity alerts is one measure) and individual alerts for some rules/URLs that are sensitive and I want to know about alerts for. Splunk is quite nice to drill down into things (it's basically a massive Grep tool in a web front end with dashboarding and alerting).

Really only use Apache error files rather than ModSecurity audit logs since they are structured to be parsed easier, so sometimes then have to look at Audit log for details but sufficient to raise the alert in first place.

This has the nice side effective of not slowing down the webserver or ModSecurity processing as run as a separate instance on a separate server and only the Splunk forwarded runs on the webserver.

Thanks,
Barry

I installed this and am testing.  I installed the early release 
candidate and fought all the battles there, so this was a super easy 
install - just copied the new rules folder and the config file over the 
old ones.  So far so good.

Hello guys, We are trying to have apache mod security audit logs piped to splunk in real time . Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions on how we can get this done?
Can  mlogc be configured to pipe logs to splunk ?

Thanks

Hi.

If you check in this splunk support link:
https://answers.splunk.com/answers/100515/modsecurity-not-reading-forwarded-events.html

"It?s correct the Splunk for ModSecurity has only been tested with flat
files, I uses this on a large enterprise environment and it works great.
I will check if there is possible to index events from ModSec mlogc in a
future version of Splunk for ModSecurity."

It seems that it's not supported splunk with mlogc but it seems you can
collect flat files logs from mod_security without splunk but with 6 splunk
version is not possible from mlogc, I think.

Regards

Hi there,

There has been some enthusiastic feedback for my series of
Apache/ModSecurity tutorials at
https://www.netnea.com/cms/apache-tutorials/

I have now finished the next guide; the introduction of the
Core Rule Set v3. Initially, I wanted to build up on an earlier version
introducing CRS2, but then I did a complete rewrite. I am going to
publish this next week after reviewing this carefully. If you ware 
interested to give a hand, then please drop me a line and I will send 
you the link.

Cheers,

Christian

Hi there,

The only options are:
 - controlling the parts you want to log
 - native or new JSON format of audit log

I wish there was more control. ;)

Ahoj,

Christian

Subject: [Owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set] CRS Status Update (2016-10-29)
Message-ID: <20161029070808.GA28799@elias>

Dear all,

This is just a brief status of what is happening with the 
Core Rule Set 3.0 release.

We had good feedback for the RC2 release. No major regressions
just a few more false positives. False negatives are also in
the mix and - somewhat unpleasant - 1-2 attack attempts, that
the CRS2 would block. This is mainly due to Walter Hop from
Dutch hosting provider slik.eu who updated their production
servers to CRS3 and keeps a close eye on the logs now.

So we have decided to update the rules a bit and push an RC3, 
likely on Tuesday. Because, every FP sorted out before the release 
is less pain for our users - and every false negative fixes means
less successful attacks on the servers.

This means the final release, OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set 3.0.0,
will be out on Tuesday, November 8. Unless new and big regressions
appear of course.

We are also preparing ideas and means to spread the word about
the release as wide as possible. If you have ideas to support this,
then let us know. Otherwise, it would be just nice if you would
be ready to tell your friends and contacts about this, once
it is out: November 8.

On some other note, I'm receiving feedback for my draft CRS tutorial 
and it seems like it will be ready for publication around 
November 1 as well.

Cheers,

Christian

Hey Christian,

I'd love to take a look at what you are planning on doing. I know I am
planning some tests similar to RC1 but more in depth. let me know :)

I would like to help if I could. I think I should get knowledge in web
attacks so in that way I could be useful (I mean I know what xss and sql
injections are but I don't know what url payloads should I block)

Regards
