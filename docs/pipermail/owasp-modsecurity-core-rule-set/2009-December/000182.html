<PRE>Pretty new to mod_security...I've got a theoretical scenario question:

Any thoughts or experience in discovering if a scenario like this can 
cause valid site requests to be blocked?  My concern is related to high 
traffic sites and the potential loss of valid traffic and business to 
the site.

My example would be an end-user of a web site, their browser/computer 
has been infected by some malicious bot.  This bot inserts malicious 
code into the legitimate web traffic of that user, in attempts to hack 
the web sites the user is using, and thus proliferate the malicious code 
more. 

The end-user, going about their normal routine of not keeping fully up 
to date with anti-virus protection continues to go about their routine 
without knowledge of their own infection. 

a) They visit a site with mod_security in place and some of their 
requests are blocked because of the inline bot.    The business 
operating the site loses the traffic and legitimate business.  Customer 
is left confused/frustrated.

b) In a scenario without mod_security in place, but where the 
application itself is hardened against the malicious attempts, the 
request would be fulfilled as the malicious junk would be stripped from 
the request.  The business operating the site gets related legitimate 
traffic and customer is left happy...though still infected.

Thanks,

Charles
