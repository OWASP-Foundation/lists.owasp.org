&gt;<i> Hi.  I have been using modsecurity 2.1.4 and the core rules which came
</I>&gt;<i> therewith.  I have made several changes to the rules, mostly in
</I>&gt;<i> modsecurity_crs_60_custom.conf by removing by id and replacing the
</I>&gt;<i> rule.  Now I was thinking of installing the new modsecurity and the new
</I>&gt;<i> core rule set -- however I have a few questions on this subject:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Are the id numbers the same, so my custom.conf rules can stay the
</I>&gt;<i> same?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I believe that all of the older rules have kept the same rule IDs, however the 
new CRS v2 allows for different approaches to exceptions rather than the older 
SecRuleRemoveById approach.  Search the mail-list for exception info.  
Specifically, you can add exceptions to the 48 local exceptions conf file.

&gt;<i> 2. I was looking on the home page for the core rule set and it said the
</I>&gt;<i> latest stable release was 2.0.4, but there seems to be no way to
</I>&gt;<i> download the new rule set at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You seemed to have gotten the info you need - just click on the Download tab 
on the OWASP CRS project site.
 
&gt;<i> 3.  Once I install the ruleset, how does the automated update work --
</I>&gt;<i> particularly with regard to overwriting changes and how often does it
</I>&gt;<i> check for its updates, or do I do this manually?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>The ModSecurity source code archive comes with a tool called rules-updater.pl 
which will *allow* automatic downloading of the CRS.  We are actually 
configuring a few things related to the rules repository so the users can 
actually use the rules-updater.pl script and this should be up and running by 
the first of the year.

The other item that we need to address is what Ivan Ristic pointed out 
recently (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-">https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-</A>
set/2009-December/000173.html) and that is that some of the CRS data/files 
really need to be migrated over to the ModSecurity code archive instead.  The 
rules need to be structured in such a way as to allow easy updating and 
automatically overlaying existing CRS directories/files.  We will take a look 
at this and see if we can come up with some options.
