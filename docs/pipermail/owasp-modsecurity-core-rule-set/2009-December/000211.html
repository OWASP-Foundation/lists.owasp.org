<PRE>Hi.  I have been using modsecurity 2.1.4 and the core rules which came
therewith.  I have made several changes to the rules, mostly in
modsecurity_crs_60_custom.conf by removing by id and replacing the
rule.  Now I was thinking of installing the new modsecurity and the new
core rule set -- however I have a few questions on this subject:

1.  Are the id numbers the same, so my custom.conf rules can stay the
same?

2. I was looking on the home page for the core rule set and it said the
latest stable release was 2.0.4, but there seems to be no way to
download the new rule set at all.

3.  Once I install the ruleset, how does the automated update work --
particularly with regard to overwriting changes and how often does it
check for its updates, or do I do this manually?

Well, this should get me started -- any assistance would be appreciated.

Your life is like a penny.  You're going to lose it.  The question is:
How do
you spend it?
