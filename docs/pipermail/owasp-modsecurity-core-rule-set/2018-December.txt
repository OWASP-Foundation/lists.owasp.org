Subject: [Owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set] CRS 3 and IdNumbering.csv
Message-ID: <a78140cd-9ca6-74de-2961-1f55b8c735d2@mailbox.org>

I found a rule ID from CRS 2.2.x that is not listed in IdNumbering.csv 
from CRS 3: 970002. It's from modsecurity_crs_50_outbound.conf and 
handles "Statistics Information Leakage". I can't find any similar rule 
in CRS 3, so I assume this rule was removed?

What I did find in IdNumbering.csv while grepping for 970002 are these 
entries:

9700020,951210
9700021,951220
9700022,951230
9700023,951240
9700024,951250
9700025,951260

But I can't find 9700020-9700025 in CRS 2.2.x. Where do those rules come 
from? Some older CRS version?

And a more general question: How was IdNumbering.csv compiled? Manually? 
Through a script? How reliable would you consider the information in there?

I'm wondering how safe it is to base some automated upgrade steps on 
IdNumbering.csv when I'm upgrading our customers from CRS 2.2.x to 3.x. 
They usually skip some rules to work around false positives. I know that 
this will be a somewhat painful major upgrade. I just don't know if I'd 
better make it extra painful by simply removing any skipped rules, 
especially since CRS 3.x improves a lot regarding false positives. Maybe 
someone can share some experiences?

Thanks for your help!

Hello everybody,

I just published the news of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set project
for the month of November:

https://coreruleset.org/20181226/crs-project-news-december-2018/

It includes the CRS 3.1 release, updates to the docker container, an
interesting success story and the first CRS 3.2 pull requests.

Best,
