<PRE>Hi there,

It's been a few weeks, and I thought I'd do another status update.

The CRS3 release was six weeks ago. We were a bit afraid, that adoption
would lead to many reports of new false positives. That is clearly not
the case. Feeling better now. You can check the open issues with CRS
3.0.0 on github:
<A HREF="https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22v3.0-dev+Development%22">https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22v3.0-dev+Development%22</A>

There is a mini-tutorial at How-To-Forge on how to run CRS3 with
ISPConfig. We may look into integrating the documented rule exclusions
in a future CRS version.
<A HREF="https://www.howtoforge.com/community/threads/mini-howto-modsecurity-crs-3-0-on-debian-jessie.74898">https://www.howtoforge.com/community/threads/mini-howto-modsecurity-crs-3-0-on-debian-jessie.74898</A>

Longtime Debian packager Alberto Gonzalez Iniesta has packaged CRS3 for
debian and published the new package. I worked with him on package
optimization (better paths, simpler includes, better description, etc.).
That work will be uploaded right before Debian Stretch (the next Debian
release) will be frozen. The Debian package is of course very important
as it will be picked up by many other distributions depending on Debian.

The tutorials about Apache/ModSecurity that I updated for CRS3 have been
translated to German. You can get them here:
<A HREF="https://www.netnea.com/cms/apache-tutorials-de/">https://www.netnea.com/cms/apache-tutorials-de/</A>

While staying at a hotel in Germany during a ModSec course I ran, I
hacked together a Core Rule Set inventory. It gives you an overview
over all CRS3 rules and serves as link to the definition of the rule
on github. There are also options for easy access like typing
&quot;crs 942100&quot; in the address bar of the browser and being taken to
the right rule entry in the rule inventory immediately. So if you
face an alert, you can type the rule id in the browser and it
gives you all you need to know about the rule that triggered the alarm:
<A HREF="https://www.netnea.com/cms/core-rule-set-inventory">https://www.netnea.com/cms/core-rule-set-inventory</A>

The next course will be in Zurich, Switzerland, near the end of
February. There is now a single early bird ticket left. And afterwards
a hand full of regular price tickets:

Chaim, Walter and I are planning to make an appearance at the
OWASP AppSecEurope conference in Belfast in May. We are planning various
talks and activities around the Core Rule Set. If you want to join
(or support and contribute!), you can follow our plans on the OWASP
wiki:
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CRSAppSecEU2017">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CRSAppSecEU2017</A>

And finally, Linux Weekly News published an article on ModSecurity last
week: 
<A HREF="https://lwn.net/Articles/708673/">https://lwn.net/Articles/708673/</A> 
A second one about CRS3 came out yesterday. It is paywalled for seven
days, afterwards it will become freely available. If you are not a
subscriber, but you want instant access nevertheless, then let me know
and I can send you a subscriber's link.

That's all that springs to mind right now.

All the best!

Christian
