<PRE>
Dear all,

In late 2016 I sent two messages with news from the Core Rule Set
Project.  Lately we had a developer meeting on IRC and we decided to
make this a regular newsletter, aiming for a once a month publication.

What has happened during the last few weeks:

- Project lead Chaim Sanders, Walter Hop and I met on IRC and we decided
  to run regular IRC meetings about CRS. The gatherings are for those
  interested in the development of the project and the rules.
  These meetings will happen once a month on the first Monday at
  20:30 MET (14:30 EST, 19:30 GMT) on Freenode IRC, channel #modsecurity
  The dates for 2017 are thus:
  April 3, 2017, 20:30 MET
  May 1, 2017, 20:30 MET
  June 5, 2017, 20:30 MET
  Jul 3, 2017, 20:30 MET
  Aug 7, 2017, 20:30 MET
  Sep 4, 2017, 20:30 MET
  Oct 2, 2017, 20:30 MET
  Nov 6, 2017, 20:30 MET
  Dec 4, 2017, 20:30 MET

- The weeding out of false positives in v3.0.0 has started. We aim to
  cover the lower paranoia levels as far as possible and issue a 3.0.1
  in the next two months; possibly without closing _all_ known false
  positives.
  <A HREF="https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs">https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs</A>

- Angelo Conforti published a pair of modsec-replay scripts. The client
  script takes an audit log entry and fires the request against a
  server.  The server script advertises a listener. It looks up the
  requests it receives in the audit log and responds with the
  appropriate response.  This allows for the testing of rule set changes
  with a mock backend with correct responses. The identification of the
  corresponding answer to a request works via a hash submitted as a HTTP
  request header.  Please give it a spin and let us know if it works for
  you.

- There is going to be a CRS3 introduction talk at the OWASP AppSecEU
  conference in Belfast. The conference takes place May 11/12, 2017.
  <A HREF="https://2017.appsec.eu">https://2017.appsec.eu</A>

- Chaim also submitted two talks to AppSecEU. But it is not yet sure if
  he is accepted as a speaker or not with one of these submissions.

- Chaim and I (Christian speaking here) will attend the AppSecEU
  conference and we hope to meet other members of the community and Core
  Rule Set users. In fact Chaim and I have never met before, so we have
  something to celebrate after our arrival; likely May 9 or 10.
 
- We also want to use the opportunity and organise a CRS summit at
  AppSecEU.  That is going to be a meeting where we will talk CRS with
  users and ideally also the vendors using ModSecurity Core Rule Set as
  part of their products.  The date is not yet fixed, but May 10 sounds
  like a good choice.  We will try and get in touch with vendors
  individually, but if you read this, then please take note. We want to
  meet you and have a chat over the Core Rule Set and it's future. We
  are interested in your experience, your issues and how you use the
  Core Rule Set. This is not a &quot;We need corporate sponsors&quot; event.  It's
  an event meant to get to know each other, talk CRS and drink a few
  beers afterwards.

- Typo3 security team member Adrian von Arx joined with me to look into
  default Rule Exclusions for Typo3. The idea is to develop a similar
  set of optional Rule Exclusions that we have for Wordpress and Drupal.
  <A HREF="https://www.netnea.com/cms/2017/01/13/starting-to-build-a-set-of-rule-exclusions-or-typo3/">https://www.netnea.com/cms/2017/01/13/starting-to-build-a-set-of-rule-exclusions-or-typo3/</A>

- Damiano Esposito from the University of Applied Sciences in Zurich is
  conducting an extensive number of tests with various Security Scanners
  targetting a vulnerable Application protected by CRS3 at various
  paranoia levels.  The first test runs look promising.  I have written
  a blog post detailing the ModSecurity CRS3 setup.
  <A HREF="https://www.netnea.com/cms/2017/02/24/optimized-lab-setup-to-attack-modsecurity-with-security-sanners/">https://www.netnea.com/cms/2017/02/24/optimized-lab-setup-to-attack-modsecurity-with-security-sanners/</A>

- In December, I talked about a paywalled Core Rule Set article at
  LinuxWeeklyNews.  Said article is now freely available and brings an
  overview of CRS3 aimed at new users.
  <A HREF="https://lwn.net/Articles/709693/">https://lwn.net/Articles/709693/</A>

- We have a lot of open issues on github thanks to dozens of feature
  requests for CRS 3.1 and beyond. This makes it somewhat hard to
  navigate the issues.  In order to help you find your way around, there
  is now a set of shortcuts to individual queries.
  <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_ModSecurity_Core_Rule_Set_Project#tab=Getting_Involved">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_ModSecurity_Core_Rule_Set_Project#tab=Getting_Involved</A>
  The shortcuts involve:
  - Open Issues 3.0.x
  - False Positives
  - False Negatives
  - Feature Requests for 3.1
  - Published research affecting project
  - Open Issues without a label / tag
  - Open Issues with a label, but without assignee
  - Open Issues before 2015
  - Open Issues before 2016
  - Open Issues before 2017

- And finally, let me remind you of a neat service at netnea.com which
  brings you information about individual rules and links to the
  definition of the rule. Here is an example:
  <A HREF="https://www.netnea.com/crs/949110">https://www.netnea.com/crs/949110</A> 
  
  If your browser supports smart bookmarks (Firefox does), then you can
  define one as follows:
  <A HREF="https://www.netnea.com/crs/%s">https://www.netnea.com/crs/%s</A> with keyword crs and then call it with
  lookup like &quot;crs 949110&quot; in the address bar of the browser.
  Very helpful and I use this several time as day.
  I also plan to expand the information displayed in this list. What
  are the bits of infos that you think should be included? Please
  respond on the list or in private.


What's coming in the next few weeks:

- Damiano and I hope to give you a sneek preview of some research
  results.
- We're closing false positives based on the issues reported on github.
- More details of the CRS summit at AppSecEU will be defined and
  published.
- Next CRS3 chat: April 3, 2017, 20:30 MET on Freenode IRC, channel
  #modsecurity (14:30 EST, 19:30 GMT) 

So this is it for the first CRS newsletter. If I missed something,
please let me know. Feedback - good and bad - is much appreciated (which
means: If you like this, then please let me know and share 
this message).

Best regards,

Christian Folini, for the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set team
