<PRE>Hi there,

The new edition of the OWASP Top Ten has been released.

<A HREF="https://owasp.blogspot.ch/2017/11/owasp-is-pleased-to-announce-release-of.html">https://owasp.blogspot.ch/2017/11/owasp-is-pleased-to-announce-release-of.html</A>

It features ModSecurity and the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set under 
A10: Insufficient Logging &amp; Monitoring under &quot;How to Prevent&quot;:

&quot;... There are commercial and open source application protection
frameworks such as OWASP AppSensor, web application
firewalls such as ModSecurity with the OWASP ModSecurity
Core Rule Set, and log correlation software with custom
dashboards and alerting.&quot;

Of course we all know, that ModSec and CRS can do a lot more than logging,
but as you probably know, OWASP is not especially friendly towards the
use of Web Application Firewalls and getting into A10 is already a big
step forward.

I do not know if Trustwave has been lobbying for the inclusion, but I do
know that we owe a lot of this to Osama Elnaggar who played an important
role in the review of the document.

In fact I was ready to get involved myself, but Osama asked me to keep a
low profile and not to raise any suspicion and a potential backfire.
This strategy worked perfectly well. Well done!

I plan to follow up with a blog post on <A HREF="https://coreruleset.org">https://coreruleset.org</A> to take
up the momentum and explain to OWASP Top Ten readers just how we can support
them. Maybe Trustwave can do the same on its blog.

Best regards,

Christian

P.S. On a similar note, four new members of the OWASP board of directors
have been announced today as well. I have spoken about CRS with three
of them before and I think they see our project in a favorable light.
