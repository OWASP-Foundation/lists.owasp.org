Subject: [Owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set] [Rule Update - Discussion Thread]
	Rule File Reorganization/Naming
In-Reply-To: <CB851CEF.45B8F%rbarnett@trustwave.com>
Message-ID: <CBE40FF6.4E7CE%rbarnett@trustwave.com>

Looking ahead to CRS v3.0, one of the changes we are looking to make is to
re-organize/rename the rules files themselves.  We want to achieve the
following:

1) Which HTTP transactional phase are the rules processing (Inbound
Request or Outbound Response)?
2) Utilize a numeric naming convention so that anyone using Apache Include
wild-carding (Include /path/to/crs/*.conf) will have the rules execute
properly.
3) Group the rule files into categories of Protocol vs. Application issues
4) Specify if the issues are attacks, data leakages or defects.

With these goals in mind, here is a new proposed rules file naming
convention.

REQUEST-10-IP-REPUTATION.conf
REQUEST-20-PROTOCOL-POLICY.conf
REQUEST-30-APPLICATION-POLICY.conf
REQUEST-40-APPLICATION-ATTACKS-SQL-INJECTION.conf
...
RESPONSE-10-APPLICATION-DATA-LEAKAGE.conf
RESPONSE-20-APPLICATION-DEFECTS.conf


Thanks goes out to Josh Zlatin who helped me work through the rationale
for these changes.

Let me know what you think or if you have comments for improvements.
