Hi,

First you need to define where the GeoDB is. This can be done in the CRS 10
file.

SecGeoLookupDb /opt/modsecurity/bin/GeoLiteCity.dat

Next you need to pass the client's IP address (REMOTE_ADDR) to the
@geoLookup operator via a rule like:

SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@geoLookup" "id:1,phase:1,t:none,pass,nolog"

Finally you limit access to the upload script (e.g. /UploadFiles.aspx) to
client IP addresses originating in Japan

SecRule GEO:COUNTRY_CODE3 "!@streq JPN"
"id:2,phase:1,t:none,log,deny,msg:'Client IP not from Japan',chain"
    SecRule REQUEST_URI "@rx /UploadFiles.aspx"

Note, this was not tested YMMV.

- Josh

Dear Josh,

Thanks you so much for your help, but I think that only for the file name UploadFiles.aspx, how about globally upload, frankly speaking I try to protect what ever upload by the hackers from the buggy script of Joomla or Wordpress, lately I?m facing a lot of trouble were hackers upload their files and run the script for sending thousands of spam mail.

Please help and Thank you so much

Hi,

One way to implement this could be to update the chained rule to search for
the presence of multipart/form-data in the REQUEST_HEADERS:Content-Type
variable instead.

ISO country codes come in 2 digit and 3 digit variables, so for
Japan GEO:COUNTRY_CODE is JP and GEO:COUNTRY_CODE3 is JPN. Either variation
is fine.

Dear All,

Please help and Thank you so much

Dear Ryan,

I just tested the rules and what I can see on Apache is:

xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [05/Sep/2014:02:05:29 +0800] "GET /index.php/appradio/item/23-all-features HTTP/1.1" 200 45429 "-" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)"
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [05/Sep/2014:02:05:30 +0800] "POST /index.php/about HTTP/1.1" 404 - http://www.com/index.php/appradio/item/23-all-features "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)"

Seem its only block for ?POST? but still allow access for ?GET?, correct me if I?m wrong.

Please advice. TQ so much for help.

Dear All,

Lately I?m facing lot of hackers were upload their script via buggy Joomla or Wordpress and run the script to sending thousands of spam mail, the sample of script as below:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(mail.php)

<?php
ini_set('mail.add_x_header','off');
$_testmail = $_REQUEST['TESTMAIL'];
$_testlink = $_REQUEST['TESTLINK'];
$_status = $_REQUEST['STATUS'];
$_snames = $_REQUEST['SNAMES'];

$_message = $_REQUEST['MESSAGE'];
$_subjects = $_REQUEST['SUBJECTS'];
$_ctype = $_REQUEST['CTYPE'];
$_spamdom = $_REQUEST['SPAMDOM'];
$_mlr = $_REQUEST['MAILER'];

$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] = "/email.php";
$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] = $_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'];

$SpamDom = explode(",", $_spamdom);
$Snames = explode(",", $_snames);
$Semails = explode(",", $_semails);
$Subjects = explode(",", $_subjects);

$_rmessage = str_replace("XXRANDOMXX", $rnx, $_message);
$_message = str_replace("\n", "\r\n", $_rmessage);
$_from = $Semails[array_rand($Semails)];
$_subject = $Subjects[array_rand($Subjects)];

$_ctype = stripslashes($_ctype);
$message  = urlencode($_message);
$message  = ereg_replace("%5C%22", "%22", $message);
$message  = urldecode($message);
$_from = stripslashes($_from);
$_message  = stripslashes($message);
$_subject  = stripslashes($_subject);

$headers   = array();
$headers[] = "From: $_from";
$headers[] = "X-Priority: 3";
$headers[] = "X-Mailer: $_mlr";
$headers[] = "MIME-Version: 1.0";
$headers[] = "Content-type: $_ctype; charset=\"UTF-8\"";
$headers[] = "Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable";

foreach ($headers as $key=>$value) {
        $headers[$key] = stripslashes($value);
}

if($_status == "CHECK") {
        if($_testmail == NULL) return 0;
        if($_from == NULL) return 0;
        if($_message == NULL) return 0;
        if($_subject == NULL) return 0;

        $_subject = $_subject . " " . $_testlink;

        mail($_testmail, $_subject, $_message, implode("\r\n", $headers));
        print "$_testmail\n\n$_message\n\n$_from\n\n$_subject";
}
elseif($_status == "MASS") {
        $_maillist = $_REQUEST['MAILLIST'];
        $emails = explode(",", $_maillist);

        if($_from == NULL) return 0;
        if($_message == NULL) return 0;
        if($_subject == NULL) return 0;

        foreach($emails as $email) {
                if($email == NULL) $email = $_testmail;
                mail($email, $_subject, $_message, implode("\r\n", $headers));
                print "$email - SENT\r\n";
        }
}
else {
        print "SENDER UP";
}
?>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hopefully theres an idea how can I prevent the hackers to run that script by mod security rules.

Please help and Thank you so much

What is the preferred method to whitelist a POST to a specific filename?
My testing shows that REQUEST_FILENAME may only apply to the GET method.

Here is my whitelist rule, which isn't currently working as expected.

SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "@streq /rpts/rptViewer.aspx"
"id:'1521',phase:'1',nolog,noauditlog,tag:'GENERAL/GENERAL',pass,ctl:ruleRemoveById=981001,t:none,t:lowercase,setvar:'tx.pars_alert=0',setvar:'tx.prepend=1'"

FYI ? you are using "t:lowercase" transformation function in your action list but using mixed case in your opertor value.

Subject: [Owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set] Whitelist POST to Filename

What is the preferred method to whitelist a POST to a specific filename?  My testing shows that REQUEST_FILENAME may only apply to the GET method.

Here is my whitelist rule, which isn't currently working as expected.

SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "@streq /rpts/rptViewer.aspx" "id:'1521',phase:'1',nolog,noauditlog,tag:'GENERAL/GENERAL',pass,ctl:ruleRemoveById=981001,t:none,t:lowercase,setvar:'tx.pars_alert=0',setvar:'tx.prepend=1'"

So far, I've been using the recommendations Redhat made.  For some reason, it looks like they removed them from the article I saw.

I am seeing some hits in my logs, but I make no claims about how effective these rules are.

Are both if these true?
Modsecurity is an Application layer firewall, and bash (any shell) is Link
Layer?

Maybe an iptables ruleset?

bash is not link layer. Put the mod_sec rules in and patch bash.

iptables can do pattern matching, but someone's already written the
mod_sec rules for you, and I suspect it has vastly better protocol
decoding capabilities.

(Sounds like more bash patches on the way according to Michal
Zalewski, so both mod_sec rules and patching are preferred rather than
either in isolation.)

cheers,
 Jamie

Application layer in the 4 layer TCP model I think. I've never really
liked the distinctions at the top of the 7 layer OSI model.
