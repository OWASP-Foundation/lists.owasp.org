<PRE>Chaim, 

There was a thing I forgot to highlight.

In fact leading up to ModSecurity v3 we&#8217;ve created 1000&#8217;s of test cases which will finally ground the ModSecurity development process in a solid foundation. Coupled with this we&#8217;ve been building out our buildbot infrastructure for monitoring these test both externally (for build control) and internally for performance testing.

I think this is a wonderful achievement and a very good
use of your and Felipe's time.

Cheers,

Christian
