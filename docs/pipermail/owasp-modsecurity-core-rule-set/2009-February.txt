In addition to Stephen's Web Goat ModSecurity project, where else can I get

Hey Dinis,
I am just now starting to populate the OWASP Project Site - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_ModSecurity_Core_Rule_Set_Project.  This will soon be *the* location for ModSecurity rules and the Core Rule Set.

Check back soon...
