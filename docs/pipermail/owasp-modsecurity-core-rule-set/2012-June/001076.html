<PRE>To me, it sounds like a database / categorization problem which you want to
solve via id's. Is there no other way to add a category indication ? In my
field, customers want to order member numbers to the alphabet. It's ok to do
that when you start, but the next new member that comes gets max_id+1
regardless of his last name.

Also, it sounds like a lot of work to categorize every rule to new numbers,
also in the future.

And lastly, indeed; for the people who make exceptions based on the current
rule id's, this will cause a lot lot of problems for them.

Mark

Onderwerp: Re: [Owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set] [Rule Update - Discussion
Thread]Updating Rule IDs


I will investigate the idea of a rule mapping, but keep in mind that
following -
One of our goals with the update is to make the rule accuracy better (less
false positives).  So, just because a specific rule is currently a false
positive and you chose to add an exception to disable it, that does not mean
that you would need to keep the exception with the new version of the rule.
ModSecurity v2.7 (will be released very soon) has the new &quot;accuracy&quot; and
&quot;maturity&quot; actions.  This will allow us (Trustwave) to give a relative score
for each of these settings.  This will help you to decide which rules to run
default or not.
As for directory structure groupings, it is my belief that all rules in the
&quot;base_rules&quot; directory should have a very high quality of accuracy (low FP
rate).  If a user wants to get more aggressive with detection, then they
will be able to activate other rule files under the &quot;experimental_rules&quot;
directory in which the accuracy/maturity values would be lower.

Thread]Updating Rule IDs



I think it is a good idea to better group the rules but it will require an
extensive review of rule exceptions.  If there is a mapping available from
the old id to the new id for those rules that are reassigned that would be
very helpful and reduce the review effort.

Subject: [Owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set] [Rule Update - Discussion
Thread]Updating Rule IDs

One of the items we are considering with the CRS v3.0 update is to start
from scratch with all of the rule IDs.  We have a defined range reserved for
the OWASP CRS -
<A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/mod-security/index.php?title=Referenc">https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/mod-security/index.php?title=Referenc</A>
e_Manual#id

900,000&#8211;999,999: reserved for the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set
[12] project

The rationale for this change is to make it easier to users to do exceptions
and disable groups ofrules by using SecRuleRemoveById, etc&#8230; That directive
has the capability to remove ranges of rule IDs, however over the years the
rule IDs were added ad-hoc and they are not properly grouped in this manner.
For instance, groupings could be something similar to this -

Protocol Violation &#8211; 900000-900099
Protocol Policies - 900100&#8211;900199
Cross-site Scripting - 900200&#8211;900299
&#8230;
We would give each rule group approx 100 rule IDs.  The initial number would
be less than thatwhich would allow some growth.  After some analysis of the
current rules, we really shouldn't ever exceed those allotments as there
ends up being rule logic duplication and you just end up with bloated rule
amounts.

Keep in mind that the active rule IDs were going to change a bit anyways
with this update as we will be consolidating many rules into highly
optimized regexes, etc..

The only concern that I have with making this move would be if users have
extensively implemented exceptions based on the current rule IDs.  They
would need to be aware of this when they migrate to v3.0.

Comments?
