<PRE>I like the idea of consolidating and making it easier to find rules. Is
there any way to map existing rule IDs to the new ones? It might allow the
change to happen without breaking so much stuff.

  One of the items we are considering with the CRS v3.0 update is to start
from scratch with all of the rule IDs.  We have a defined range reserved

 project

 The rationale for this change is to make it easier to users to do
exceptions and disable groups of rules by using SecRuleRemoveById, etc&#8230;
That directive has the capability to remove ranges of rule IDs, however
over the years the rule IDs were added ad-hoc and they are not properly
grouped in this manner.  For instance, groupings could be something similar
to this -


   - Protocol Violation &#8211; 900000-900099
   - Protocol Policies - 900100&#8211;900199
   - Cross-site Scripting - 900200&#8211;900299
   - &#8230;

We would give each rule group approx 100 rule IDs.  The initial number
would be less than that which would allow some growth.  After some analysis
of the current rules, we really shouldn't ever exceed those allotments as
there ends up being rule logic duplication and you just end up with bloated
rule amounts.

 Keep in mind that the active rule IDs were going to change a bit anyways
with this update as we will be consolidating many rules into highly
optimized regexes, etc..

 The only concern that I have with making this move would be if users have
extensively implemented exceptions based on the current rule IDs.  They
would need to be aware of this when they migrate to v3.0.

 Comments?
