<PRE>Dear all,

Following discussions here on the list and my recent blogpost,
Chaim and I talked things through and I will develop a pull request
to introduce a paranoia mode into the core rule set.

The paranoia mode will be enabled by setting a special variable,
which will then execute a bunch of additional rules for added security
but with the disadvantage of a higher rate of false positives when
left untuned.

Some rules, which did not make the cut into the 3.0.0-dev tree, will
reappear in this setting as will some new rules.

The details are not clear so far and a fair bunch of work still has
to be done. Therefore, I am looking to recruit 2-3 people who are 
interested in this feature set. This is a nice task to dive deeper
into the inner workings of the core rules and it is an option to
help directing the development of the next major release.

I am ok with working with core rule newbies, as long as you have a 
basic unferstanding of ModSecurity.

Please respond here or via private mail. 

Best,

Christian Folini
