Ryan,

Thank you very much for this. It worked!

I have only done very limited testing, but the specific case I outlined
previously (adding a new email identity in squirrelmail) certainly
worked without any mod_sec intervention. Interestingly, deleting an
identity did cause an entry in the mod_sec log but the action was not
blocked and the identity was deleted. This is such a rare event that I
can't say that it merits any more work or investigation on your part.

So once again, thank you for all your help.

I do still have one other outstanding issue with mod_sec, and that is to
do with its relationship with squidGuard on my network (I posted about
that too some time ago) but I am conscious that I have already taken too
much of your time and I think I will wait until CRS 2.0.5 comes out
before I bother you with that again, in case 2.0.5 solves it anyway.

Thanks!

Mark
