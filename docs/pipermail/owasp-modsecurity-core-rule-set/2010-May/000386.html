I'm actually using the rules on the trunk, thought I'm only playing with the base_rules so far.  And you're right - there are only two rules that check the anomaly score.  I've added the setvar to them, but there are 19 other rules that don't specify a disruptive action (i.e., pass.)  Also, at least some of those rules don't seem to have id: actions.  (Many of these rules seem to be auto-generated from PHPIDS?)  No worries - I added the setvar to those rules directly, but I wonder if those rules could be better integrated into the whole anomaly-scoring scheme?

I still have some finishing up to do, but all in all it was a lot less work than I thought it would be.  Mostly due to the elegance of the CRS - so thanks!  =)  Still, a generic solution would let me work with any rule set without modifying it...

&gt;<i> You could probably write a script to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain this :)
</I>
That's the next step, part of figuring out how to keep the rules updated once this goes into production.

&gt;<i> But I think the easiest way is to use a phase:5 rule.  For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # Example blocking rule
</I>&gt;<i> SecRule ARGS &quot;attack&quot; \
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;phase:2,log,auditlog,deny,status:403,id:12345&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # In phase 5, then look for that 403 and set SESSION var
</I>&gt;<i> SecRule RESPONSE_STATUS &quot;@eq 403&quot; \
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;phase:5,pass,nolog,setvar:SESSION.tagged=1&quot;
</I>
I played with this sort of scenario for most of a day.  The underlying problem is to identify whether a transaction has been blocked.  Using a status like your example (or TX variables, or whatever) only rearranges the problem, because (as far as I can tell) mod_security doesn't expose a flag to show whether the transaction is being blocked.

I went so far as to browse the mod_security code to see how hard it would be to expose that information, perhaps by enhancing the RULE collection.  I quickly realized that it would take more than an idle afternoon to familiarize myself with the code enough to even begin thinking about that...
