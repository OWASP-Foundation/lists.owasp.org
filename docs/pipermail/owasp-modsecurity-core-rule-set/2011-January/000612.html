Agreed, you should be applying your thoughts to the arena of &quot;web
application security,&quot; where mod_security is your method of
implementing/testing/analyzing your particular focus.

The iterations of the CRS are a pain since they can change a bit with
each release, but that is the nature of their maturity. They are hard to
understand since they aren't documented in detail.
 
You know, the webgoat project (a kind of web app honey pot at

&lt;blocked::<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project</A>&gt;
and I seem to recall another one used by Google) being protected by
mod_security would be an ideal way to document (and do unit testing on)
the CRS. I don't know if that is how the CRS is tested and benchmarked?
 
I would have to say that the LUA scripting engine would be also be an
ideal place to insert your value or hypothesis with or without using the
CRS since mod_security is an incredible auditing tool:
 
- test out new, hypothesized attacks and create an algorithmic or
heuristic response to log/drop the attacks in LUA/custom rules/etc.
- attach mod_security to a Bayesian filter
(<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_filter">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_filter</A>) and apply email like
tactics to web traffic/attacks

Subject: [mod-security-users] mod_security - how to use for master
thesis?


Hi, I've been playing with mod_security for some time and I'd like
somehow to use it in my master thesis. I don't know exactly how this
work could be more interesting than describing what mod_security does,
what kind of web attacks can be prevented using it, what are other
functions of it (like analysing if the requests are really HTTP,
analysing XML). I'd rather not focus on this particular tool, but create
some system that would secure for example some specific kinds of
websites. Are there any tools that help organising, applying mod
security rules? Is it needed? What could make it more reaserch-like? Any
hints please?
