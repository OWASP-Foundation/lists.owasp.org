<PRE>Sounds like upgrading is the best option.  

Thanks Ryan.

(Multiple Parameters with the same Name)


&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>Our developer has a form which submits 2 inputs with the same name.
</I>&gt;<i>There are 2 check boxes and if he select one checkbox and submit
</I>&gt;<i>everything works fine but if he select both checkboxes he gets an access
</I>&gt;<i>denied code 403 error.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>Can anyone explain how to create an exception so this doesn&#185;t happen.  I
</I>&gt;<i>have attached the error log.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please be as detail as possible because I know little about mod_security.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks in advance for your help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>Regards,

Josue,
I would suggest that you upgrade your OWASP CRS package.  You are using
v2.0.1 and the current version is 2.0.10.  As to your specific issue, the
old CRS that you are using issued alerts for HTTP Parameter Pollution
(HPP) when there are more than 1 parameters with the same name.  This was
a crude attempt at detection as, as you have shown, there are still
legitimate scenarios where an app may have multiple params with the same
name.  In newer CRS, we have moved the HPP rules to the experimental rules
files (instead of in the 40 generic attacks file as it is with your
version).  Additionally, the newer HPP rules don't alert when multiple
params have the same name, but instead attempts to concat the payloads
into a new TX variable that is then inspected by the other attack rules.

If you can't upgrade CRS at this time, I would suggest that you just
comment out that rule.

Hope this helps,
Ryan
