<PRE>I'm getting the famous MSC_PCRE_LIMITS_EXCEEDED error on a specific request, and not able to circumvent it by raising the SecPcreMatchLimit value; I've raised it to SecPcreMatchLimit 10000000 (ten million!) and it's still blocked.

Looks to me like a broken regex. 

1. So maybe this is a bug report. Can you guys confirm the issue, based on the data included below?

2. How do I find which rule has the regex blocking this request? (I don't mean rule 200004, which blocks MSC_*, I mean the rule with the broken regex that caused too much recursion.

error_log:
