<PRE>Greetings everyone,
In an effort to consoldate our Issue tracking, we have chosen to migrate all tickets from our public JIRA system over to our GitHub Issue trackers.  This is for both ModSecurity itself and for the OWASP ModSecurity CRS.  This move solves many issues as all our code was already migrated to GitHub so utlilzing the built in Issue tracker makes resolving issues easier.  While this does solve many issues moving forward, there were a few minor issues with the automated migration we used -

  1.  Issue creation timestamps are gone
  2.  The Reporter data was not able to be automatically mapped to current GitHub users.  So, if you opened a ticket in JIRA, you won't be getting the automated emails when we comment on them.  I suggest you use GitHub accounts moving forward and it should work fine.

We have shut down public access to JIRA as of this afternoon.  If you try to access the old URLs, you should be redirected to GitHub Issues.

Please let us know if you have any problems or questions.
