Absolutely.  The first item of business, as I see it, is with regards to documentation.  
That was the main driver for moving to OWASP - the wiki project site capabilities.  Now, 
anyone can create an OWASP account and go in a edit whatever you want.  The Core Rule Set 
needs much better documentation, use cases, exceptions, etc...  

As I stated in another email thread a day or so ago - I am going to initiate this 
documentation soon.  I will pick one attack that the CRS addresses and then we will 
discuss it on the mail-list.  I will then update the OWASP project site with the 
documentation.  This can then be used as the &quot;template&quot; format for documenting how the CRS 
addresses issues.  With this in place, then anyone in the community can go in, copy the 
template and document a new attack mitigation.

This will be a HUGE step in the right direction.
