<PRE>Hi Achim,

Good to hear from you. Unfortunately, nobody else responded. We'll
see how far we can get.

You hit the nail on the head. We first had a response splitting
vulnerability. Then we lowered the limit (which had been raised by
a sysadmin on his own), then the pen-tester worked around the lower
limit with this redirect vulnerability scoring 3 on the core ruleset.

I think that is due.

Agreed.

So what can we do? I must say I am a bit at loss when thinking about a
good _generic_ approach.

(1) Disallow CR/LF in Query-Strings
    This seems do-able, but it does not help us with request bodies
(2) Disallow CR/LF in Query-Strings and Request Bodies
    This will raise a ton of false positives. But tuning them away
    on certain input fields could do the job
(3) Disallow CR/LF in Query-Strings and Request Bodies in combination
    with certain keywords
    This might bring less false positives, but &quot;Refresh&quot; is a standard
    word, so you can not rule them out.
    What keywords would need to be covered to address the issue?
    What transformation / escape variants?
(4) Disallow refresh header / meta tag in response phases
    Will only work when ResponseBodyAccess is enabled.
    And I think there are are still tons of applications around who
    redirect applications in this way. -&gt; False Positives
(5) Define a list of allowed redirects, then disallow refresh headers /
    meta tags not pointing to these hosts/domains.
    I am not sure if such a list / variable-to-take-this-list
    exists in the core rules. It's definitely a pain in the A* to
    maintain. And the restriction with ResponseBodyAccess
    in (4) applies too.

I am not particularly fond of all these variants and I would appreciate
if somebody had a better idea.

Ahoj,

Christian

P.S. I will talk about practical CRS Tuning in Berne, Switzerland,
next Tuesday, 4pm. If anybody wants to join.
