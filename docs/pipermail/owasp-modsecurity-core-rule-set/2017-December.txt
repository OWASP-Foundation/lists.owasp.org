Subject: [Owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set] Setting tx.anomaly_score before
 including crs-setup.conf somehow works, should it?
Message-ID: <ea570189-e948-8c5f-1455-bc39fa3e4686@apra.it>

Hi, I'm using CRS 3.0.2 on ModSec 2.9.2

I'm including crs like this:

[root at waf01 ~]# tail -n 3 /etc/httpd/conf.d/000_mod_security.conf
IncludeOptional /etc/httpd/modsecurity.d/*.conf
IncludeOptional /etc/httpd/crs/crs-setup.conf
IncludeOptional /etc/httpd/crs/rules/*.conf

I'm using rules in modsecurity.d/ for custom rules and so on
I would expect that setting tx.anomaly_score in a rule file in 
modsecurity.d would make no sense, since the var get reset in 
crs/rules/REQUEST-901-INITIALIZATION.conf (901200) which gets loaded 
AFTER my rules.

But it somehow works, for example this rule in 
modsecurity.d/local_rules.conf

# Spamhaus XBL (scoring)
SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@rbl xbl.spamhaus.org" \
   "msg:'Client IP in xbl.spamhaus.org.',\
   severity:'CRITICAL',\
   id:10003,\
   phase:request,\
   pass,\
   t:none,\
   tag:'application-multi',\
   tag:'language-multi',\
   tag:'platform-multi',\
   tag:'attack-reputation-ip',\
   setvar:'tx.msg=%{rule.msg}',\
   setvar:tx.anomaly_score=+10,\
setvar:tx.%{rule.id}-AUTOMATION/MALICIOUS-%{matched_var_name}=%{matched_var}

The additional 10 points get counted in the final 
TX:inbound_anomaly_score and causes the request to be rejected.

This is _exactly_ what I want :) But as far as I understand it shouldn't 
work or I don't get in which order the rules are included and evaluated

Hey Cristian,

No, this works perfectly. Let me tell you why:

The crs-setup.conf does not actually set the threshold. Instead the
REQUEST-901 initialization file sets the threshold to the default value
if it is not set.

You are setting the anomaly score in your rule file in modsecurity, so no
need to set it to the default during the initialization.

This is very close to what I personally favor: Setting it in the server
config and not in an include. That way the threshold is always in plane sight.
Same for paranoia level btw.

Ahoj,

Christian

In REQUEST-901 thresholds are set to default if not already set, I know. 
Like in

# Default Inbound Anomaly Threshold Level (rule 900110 in setup.conf)
SecRule &TX:inbound_anomaly_score_threshold "@eq 0" \
     "id:901100,\
     phase:1,\
     pass,\
     nolog,\
     setvar:tx.inbound_anomaly_score_threshold=5"

But the tresholds are not the issue here: I set *tx.anomaly.score* in my 
rules like this:
   setvar:tx.anomaly_score=+10,\

and 901200 should re(set) everything to 0:

SecAction \
  "id:901200,\
   phase:1,\
   nolog,\
   pass,\
   t:none,\
   setvar:tx.anomaly_score=0,\
   setvar:tx.sql_injection_score=0,\
   setvar:tx.xss_score=0,\
   setvar:tx.rfi_score=0,\
   setvar:tx.lfi_score=0,\
   setvar:tx.rce_score=0,\
   setvar:tx.php_injection_score=0,\
   setvar:tx.http_violation_score=0,\
   setvar:tx.session_fixation_score=0,\
   setvar:tx.inbound_anomaly_score=0,\
   setvar:tx.outbound_anomaly_score=0,\
   setvar:tx.sql_error_match=0"


There are no conditionals like in 901100.

What am I missing?

Hi there,

I just realized, there has not been a reminder with regards to today's project
chat.

Here you go: 20:30 CET (14:30 EDT, 18:30 GMT)
on Freenode IRC, channel #modsecurity
If you're interested in learning more about the project or you are
interested in a particular issue/feature, we'd love to hear from you.
The current agenda can be found here:

https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues/972

Take a peek, there is a nice surprise coming up!

Hope to see you there,

Christian

Sorry, I jumped to conclusions too quickly then.

The problem sounds as if you would have to raise the debug log level and
work your way through the file to see which rule sets which value and in
what order.

Ahoj,

Christian

Ok, so this is my config:
End of /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
IncludeOptional conf.d/*.conf

[root at waf01 ~]# ls -1 /etc/httpd/conf.d/
000_mod_evasive.conf
000_mod_security.conf
000_mod_ssl.conf
000_mod_status.conf
vhost1.conf
vhost2.conf
ecc

End of /etc/httpd/conf.d/000_mod_security.conf:
IncludeOptional /etc/httpd/modsecurity.d/*.conf
IncludeOptional /etc/httpd/crs/crs-setup.conf
IncludeOptional /etc/httpd/crs/rules/*.conf


[root at waf01 ~]# ls -1 /etc/httpd/modsecurity.d/
000_whitelist_rules.conf
cutwail_zenobi.data
local_rules.conf
runav.conf
whitelist_ip.data

In /etc/httpd/modsecurity.d/local_rules.conf I have:
# Debug test
SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@ipMatch 217.133.31.142" \
   "msg:'Client IP in Test list',\
   severity:'CRITICAL',\
   id:10099,\
   phase:request,\
   pass,\
   t:none,\
   tag:'application-multi',\
   tag:'language-multi',\
   tag:'platform-multi',\
   tag:'attack-reputation-ip',\
   setvar:'tx.msg=%{rule.msg}',\
   setvar:tx.anomaly_score=+20,\
setvar:tx.%{rule.id}-AUTOMATION/MALICIOUS-%{matched_var_name}=%{matched_var}"

Then I did
curl https://www.vhost.com and the request got rejected (20/11 score, 11 
is my threshold)

Now I have the full debug trace of the request but it's a huge amount of 
data.
I think the culprit is this:

https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual#Processing_Phases
Note : Keep in mind that rules are executed according to phases, so even 
if two rules are adjacent in a configuration file, but are set to 
execute in different phases, they would not happen one after the other. 
The order of rules in the configuration file is important only within 
the rules of each phase. This is especially important when using the 
skip and skipAfter actions.

My rules use phase:request, which I suppose is equivalent to phase:2, 
while REQUEST-901-INITIALIZATION.conf are all phase:1
Anyway this is the (mostly cleaned) log:

Starting phase REQUEST_HEADERS.
This phase consists of 159 rule(s).

Cristian,

You are getting there. Yet the DebugLogLevel is still not high enough.
Put it to 9and then you grep for the threshold variable in the logfile.
This will allow you to see which rule sets the threshold and in what order.

It is possible it's a phase issue. But when I looked over it in your
previous message the suspicion was not confirmed. But I am not ruling it out.

Ahoj,

Christian

Subject: [Owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set] Setting tx.anomaly_score

I'm quite sure the phase is the issue. I run the log with Debug 9, just 
pasted here a "cleaned up" version. Setting the phase to 1 in my custom 
rules causes the anomaly score to reset in REQUEST-901-INITIALIZATION.conf

I'll investigate further

This is the CRS newsletter covering the period from Early November until
11/04/2017. *Please note the schedule change for next month*

We held our monthly community chat. We had quite a few people stop by.
Special thanks to lifeforms for leading the chat.

   -
      - lifeforms
      - emphazer
      - franbuehler
      - spartantri
      - fzipi
      - hamlet_

Our agenda from before the chat is available here
<https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues/972>. We had a
short chat, during the chat we discussed the following:

   - @dune73 will be attending German Open Source Business Awards
   <http://award.osb-alliance.de>. Chances look good that CRS will a top
   performer. More information can be found here
   <http://award.osb-alliance.de/2017/12/01/unsere-osbar-kandidaten-teil-1/>
   - Using t:lowercase versus (?i) performance and best practice.
      - There is currently no definitive answer
      - A benchmark can be done using ModSecurity debug logs
      - @spartantri will reach out to contacts to determine best approach
      for measuring and update us next meeting.
   - There are an excessive amount of open PRs and Issues
      - All but three PRs have been assigned reviewers, we have to make a
      dent this month.
   - The Java rules, that are a key feature of 3.1 need some attention
      - The older versions are available here:
      https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/blob/95e7e6b3982eca93989c7948faca4a961737eace/rules/REQUEST-944-APPLICATION-ATTACK-JAVA.conf
      - A new ticket will be opened taking into account discussions from
      https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/pull/881/files
   - Badging
      - We may remove the gitter badge because we don't feel big enough for
      two chats and IRC is preferred (more discussion next chat)
      - We should investigate other functional badges using
      https://github.com/OWASP/github-template as an example.
   - General question about determine if it is possible to determine if
   user is accessing via HOSTS file.
      - It is not
   - Travis and FTW PRs assigned to csanders
   - #957 rule split: move part to PL3 to prevent JSON false positives
   - PR #896 awaiting fgs update on the PR we think if the comments were
   taken into account it would be a quick and nice merge, but for now it's
   stalled
   - Fizipi resolved the conflict 896 resolving the conflict on this one

The next community chats will be held on the following dates:

   - January 8, 2018 20:30 CET *(Note: The change from our normal schedule)*
   - February 5, 2018 20:30 CET
   - March 5, 2018 20:30 CET

Good day Guys

I just thought I would share a video tutorial that may be of interest.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=SD7ForrwUMY

I came to know of the above tut via

https://www.blackmoreops.com/2017/12/13/bypass-web-application-firewall-using-wafninja/

Hope this helps and is of some help to the project and community.

Regards

Brent

Hello Brent,

Thank you for the link to the presentation and the article.

Khalil Bijjou also presented at DeepSec Vienna in November and I have been in
touch with him briefly afterwards.

I used the tool a bit, yet it is not quite easy as the documentation is
lacking in my eyes (--help does not give you all the options. You need to
look in the source code) and I could not get my head around the fuzzing
options. Also the article on blackmoreops is very brief and the video
does not answer all the questions.

So what I would really love to see is a demonstration of this WAFNinja tool
against CRS3 with a report on the bypasses discovered by WAFNinja.

I should probably dig deeper myself, but too much on my plate these days.

Ahoj,

Christian

Subject: [Owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set] Substantial and unacceptable
	latency impact using mod_security and core rule set
Message-ID: <2D313B50-87F3-43A1-97B8-2952B4C859BB@exonetric.com>

Hi,

In an initial set of performance tests with mod_security 2.9.2 and the core rule set under Apache 2.2.34, we are seeing the latency for individual requests rise from 8 milliseconds to 40 milliseconds which seems like too much.   Is this kind of latency impact to be expected? What options do we have for reducing it without throwing away mod_security?

Mark,

Latency is an issue and the amount depends on the server. Factor 5 is a bit
steep, but still possible.

My mileage is usually a 5-10% hit on the throughput of a reverse proxy. If
your server serves only static files and no backend connection, then your
numbers could be real.

I would want to look at the individual requests, though.
Is 40 ms the mean? Is it some requests or all of them? If some, which ones?

The tutorials at https://www.netnea.com come with an extended Apache Access
Log format that lets you gauge the performance impact a bit better. Once you
have the data, you can dig down and identify the individual requests / rules
that cause the delay. Raising the debug-log-level on individual requests let
you identify the individual rule of an individual request with a high
performance impact quite easily. And then tune them away.

Also, CRS3 comes with a feature called Sampling Mode that allows you to run
the rules only on a percentage of the requests. This allows you to test / tune
with real world data without bringing the whole service down. This is
specifically aimed at services where the performance impact is unclear
and a potential risk.

Performance issues are generally solvable with a compromise between
performance and security. And ModSec gives you a ton of performance
information so it is generally possible to nail down the problem.

Hope this helps for a start. If you need more infos, then just ask.

Good luck!

Christian
