<PRE>Hi there,

The recent Area41 conference in Zurich saw my presentation of the
Core Rules 3.0 with the upcoming Paranoia Mode. My slides are at
<A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/ChristianFolini/owasp-modsecurity-core-rules-paranoia-mode">http://www.slideshare.net/ChristianFolini/owasp-modsecurity-core-rules-paranoia-mode</A>

My presentation explained the Core Rules and the new Paranoia Mode.
I showed stats about various tests of the ruleset in vanilla and
attack situations. The core is the slide 21, where you see numbers
of a big commercial b2c site with the new 3.0.0 CRS installed
in parallel with 2.2.9. The numbers are impressive: Security is still
very high and 99% of false positives are gone in the untuned
default installation.

While 3.0.0 is still in development it is now possible to run the
ruleset in productive environments.

The final slide announces a ModSecurity course in London on 
September 22/23:
<A HREF="https://www.feistyduck.com/training/modsecurity-training-course">https://www.feistyduck.com/training/modsecurity-training-course</A>

I have also written a blog post about the course at
<A HREF="https://www.netnea.com/cms/2016/06/20/more-about-the-modsecurity-course-in-london/">https://www.netnea.com/cms/2016/06/20/more-about-the-modsecurity-course-in-london/</A>

Teaching such a course is obviously a great opportunity for me. But 
beyond myself, it is also an interesting test case for ModSecurity: Does 
ModSecurity have the traction to allow for such a regular offering?

So I am very excited at this moment in my career. And I want to give 
the ModSecurity community a place in the first row:
So we created a coupon code MODSECML to give you privileged access. 
It will allow 5 people to attend with a 200&#163; discount. This combined 
with the early bird discount will bring you the course for 1095&#163; 
(about 1400 Euros).

The course is also a place to meet and talk about ModSecurity and the
Core Rules. The program I developed has enough air to respond to 
questions and discuss them in the group. And this is likely the most
interesting thing about the course for me: To meet, to look at
ModSecurity in detail and to talk about it.

Please help me to spread the word and make this course a success.

If you are interested in the course, but you think is a bit far, then
Feist Duck is also interested to organise the course near you
Please write to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set">training at feistyduck.com</A> for a quote.
In fact, there is some traction for a public course in Switzerland in
August or perhaps October. Please get in touch if your are interested
in this.

Best regards,

Christian
