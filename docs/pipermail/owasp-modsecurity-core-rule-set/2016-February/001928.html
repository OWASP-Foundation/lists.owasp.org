It is an artefact from an older version. It is so old, it is not even on github
(core rules were maintained on a subversion server before) anymore.

There is a minimal trace of this functionality in 2.2.X in the file
modsecurity_crs_20_protocol_violations.conf. Unfortunately, I do not
remember if it was in use with a wider set of rules.

I seem to remember it being introduced by Ryan Barnett as a means to get
tougher rules into the core ruleset. But I never saw anybody use the
mode and AFAIK Ryan did not pursue this, so it disappeared at a given
moment. I'd say the reason was lack of use.

It was not of much use in my eyes because the concept was developed far enough.

This time, the use concept is very clear and we are also providing
documentation and a guide to decide if it is worth the effort.

Hope this helps!

Christian
