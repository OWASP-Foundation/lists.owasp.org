<PRE>Chaim,

It seems you have been the only one who wanted to keep the 
old country list active. Now Manuel and Franziska chimed
in and stated they would rather not continue with the
country list being active (or move it into paranoia) as
others have before.

For me, geoip-blocking is a separate decision on its own.
If somebody wants to activate that, it should be a
deliberate move, independent of the paranoia setting.
It could be linked with a paranoia level and enabled
as a side effect, but local sites in Romania would stop
functioning immediately and that is not our
intention with the paranoia mode.

Enabling paranoia and then remember to think about
activating / reconfiguring the country list in order to
activate geoip-blocking is also complicated.

So under the line, I think keeping the rule active
but with a default empty list of countries is the
best move in our situation.

I am going to do a separate pull request for this change.
That way it is completely independent of the paranoia
mode changes.

Ahoj,

Christian
