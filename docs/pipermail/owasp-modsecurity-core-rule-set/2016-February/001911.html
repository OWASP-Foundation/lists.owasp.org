<PRE>Hello again,

&gt;<i> In my logs I only see mass scanners trying this, and there is one vendor appliance which is doing &#8220;compliance&#8221; checks on an IP address constantly. This appliance annoys me: you don&#8217;t even know my HOSTNAME and you make claims about my site actually being working and compliant? And people pay money for that? I like blocking that thing out of spite, but that&#8217;s just personal.

It's totally true that it's an annoying practice and 
should be stopped. But if you look at it with the
eyes of a newbie ModSec user, he will see a lot of
FPs in this class, which block the view on the more
severed alerts. Not necessarily by score, but by sheer
number of alerts.

Moving it to paranoia mode would free the view on the
more important exceptions.

&gt;<i> Anyway, you&#8217;ve given some good cases for allowing IP addresses, it&#8217;s not too controversial.

Thanks.

&gt;<i> It's kind of a mixed bag because we still want ModSecurity to be effective at blocking the easy rift raft (opportunistic attackers) but we want it to be easy to configure. Perhaps we make a 'domain name' configuration in the setup.conf and if it has been configured the rule comes into effect. I don't know that IF they have a domain we see too many false positives, most are things that as walter described, are just laziness. Thoughts?
</I>
Why don't we simply move it to paranoia mode? Instead of having to
understand the additional &quot;domain name&quot; config, a user simply raises the
paranoia level and ends up with more positives and if he thinks
some of these requests are leggit/FPs, he will whitelist them.
That would have the same effect as the &quot;domain name&quot; configuration
but with a more generic tuning process.

Ahoj,

Christian
