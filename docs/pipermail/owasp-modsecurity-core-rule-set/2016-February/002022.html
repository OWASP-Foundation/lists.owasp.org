<PRE>In general the Core Rule Set project has been moving along at a much faster pace in the past few months thanks to increased community involvement. In general I wanted to call out two individuals specifically, although there are MANY others involved and their help is also greatly valued; not only by me but by everyone in the community. As many of you know both Christian Folini (Dune73) and Walter Hop (Lifeforms) have been working extremely hard organizing and committing to various aspects of the upcoming OWASP CRS-3.0.0-RC1 release. In recognition of their support and hard work, I would like to announce that they have been given write-access to the OWASP-CRS GitHub. While we don&#8217;t have official titles, I bestow the unofficial title of &#8216;Core Contributor/Developer&#8217; upon you both. I&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to congratulate both of these gentlemen and thank them for their diligent work. Thank you.
