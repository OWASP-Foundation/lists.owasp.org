<PRE>Hello Christian,

Thanks for this great explanation. I tested further and found a defecting rule (specific, not CRS) which caused the described behavior: no phase:2 rules on requests without body. I corrected the rule, it should resolve some of my issues. Now, it seems that requests which fail and are not served by Apache (e.g. &quot;Invalid URI in Request.&quot;)  do not go through the phase:2 rules. Investigating.

Regards,
Aymeric

It's a bit different.

Traditionally ModSec has 5 phases:
1
2
3
4
5

5 is the logging phase when the request is already over.
3 and 4 are the response header and response body phases.

With 1 and 2 things are more complicated.

1 used to be the phase running after the requests headers where received. But then people constantly complained the rules in containers as directory / location would simply be ignored (container springing into action only when the request body was received). So Ivan Risti&#263; (somebody correct me if it was not him) gave up and pushed phase 1 on the same apache hook as phase 2.

This means, that phase 1 runs on the same apache hook as phase 2. But phase 1 runs before phase 2. (which is a neat detail for some of the more adventurous rule contructs).

The method (or the fact that a request has a body or not) is irrelevant for the phases. Phase 2 happens no matter if there is a body or not.

If you are not happy with the merging of phase 1 and phase 2, then you can compile ModSec with the option --enable-request-early. That is a good practice in my eyes.
For it allows you to block a request _before_ you start to receive the request body. This could come to your advantage in special situations like the prevention of file uploads etc.

Lately, some of the phases received an alias:
 2 - request
 4 - response
 5 - logging

But that's just an alias.

Hope this helps. So it was a conscious move, but that does not mean that I think the general shift of rules onto phase 2 was a very good idea.

Ahoj,

Christian




&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A typical example is the rule id 960911 (REQUEST-20-PROTOCOL-ENFORCEMENT) which validates the HTTP request line: it seems to me that it should be validated for requests including those without body, but the phase is now phase:request on CRS v3.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Besides, there are a lot of other examples in 
</I>&gt;<i> REQUEST-21-PROTOCOL-ATTACK where it seems to me that the rules should be put on phase:1. (E.g. smuggling, response splitting.) The same applies to REQUEST-10-IP-REPUTATION.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do I miss something ? Is this a conscious choice ?
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for enlightening me.
