<PRE>Hello,

We have finished the list of rule candidates for our little
pet project. I have a working implementation under
<A HREF="https://github.com/dune73/owasp-modsecurity-crs/tree/paranoia-mode">https://github.com/dune73/owasp-modsecurity-crs/tree/paranoia-mode</A>
and I think it is time to sort out the naming question
before submitting the first pull request with the basic mechanics.
(-&gt; see <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_ModSec_CRS_Paranoia_Mode">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_ModSec_CRS_Paranoia_Mode</A>
for an explanation of the 4 pull requests planned)

I started out this project with the idea of an &quot;on/off&quot; setting.
Hence the idea of &quot;mode&quot;. However, it became clear we are going
to work with a &quot;level&quot; ranging from 0-4 instead. So the idea of
&quot;mode&quot; no longer really applies. We need to find something better.

But of course, the core question is, if this should be called
paranoia, paranoid, strict or agressive or something else.

I opted for paranoia from the start and I still think it is the
right term. However, there has been opposition and we need to find
a solution everybody can agree with. I also think this is an
important discussion, as it is a non-technical discussion. So
everybody can chime in without being an expert and without running
lengthy tests in his lab.

Let me open the discussion with my reasoning why &quot;paranoia&quot; is the
right term. I will then continue to discuss the other options
and then you can respond and tell me why I am wrong and why the
other options are much better suited....

&quot;Paranoia&quot; is the new normal. The more the attacks evolve and the
more servers we configure, the more we realise, there is no real
security without being paranoid. So while paranoia used to be
a negative term, it is getting a more and more positive connotation;
especially in IT security.
Google the terms 
paranoid information security 
and you will get 2M hits. One of the top ones is
<A HREF="http://www.darkreading.com/operations/the-perfect-infosec-mindset-paranoia-+-skepticism/a/d-id/1297596">http://www.darkreading.com/operations/the-perfect-infosec-mindset-paranoia-+-skepticism/a/d-id/1297596</A>
where the author says paranoia is the standard mindset now 
(hence paranoia mode) and that you need to pair this with
skepticism (in other words: the tuning of your ruleset).

Other hits include the following titles:
13 Security and Privacy Tips for the Truly Paranoid
Security for the Paranoid - SecurityFocus
I became paranoid with computer security issues, I always ...
The paranoid CISO | CSO Online
Computer-Security Paranoia
openssl - How paranoid should the average user be about ...

Looking through some of these hits, I get the felling that those
who really care about security acknowledge that they are paranoid
and that they think that is the right attitude.

I also remember reading about paranoid security settings 10-20 years ago
and I would skip them immediately. Now, when looking at a new software
or product, the term paranoia immediately catches my eye and I read
about the most paranoid options first and then decide if the product is
any good. Without paranoia options, I think it must be a happy sunshine
hippy thing.

Additionally, the term &quot;PARANOID_MODE&quot; is already there, even if it has
not been in wide use in the 2.2.X series of rules:

2.2.X&gt; grep -r -i paranoi | wc -l
9

The Merriam-Wester dictionary has multiple definitions for paranoia.
One of them is:
&quot;a tendency on the part of an individual or group toward excessive or
irrational suspiciousness and distrustfulness of others&quot;

I think the adjectives &quot;excessive&quot;, &quot;irrational&quot; &quot;distrustful&quot;
characterise our new functionality very well: When raising the level,
you are enabling additional rules, which will cause an excessive number
of false positives due to a general distrustful attitude towards user
submitted input.

Ideally, two years down the line, ModSecurity (Core Rules) discussion
will run like this:
&quot;Man, I should install ModSecurity and the Core Rules on my server,
but I heard false positives are going to kill me.&quot;
&quot;No worries, as long as you keep the paranoia setting low, false
positives are minimal.&quot;

Two weeks ago, the register ran a story about 
Rob Joyce, head of NSA's Tailored Access Operations:
<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/28/nsas_top_hacking_boss_explains_how_to_protect_your_network_from_his_minions/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/28/nsas_top_hacking_boss_explains_how_to_protect_your_network_from_his_minions/</A>
The article closed with the register quoting Joyce:
&quot;At the end of the day it all boils down to knowing your network, 
he said, and it&#8217;s vital that IT administrators pick up their game 
and get paranoid about attacks.&quot;

Well said. And the core rules paranoia feature is going to help
with this in a controlled way without killing you with
false positives on the first day of the installation.

But let's look at the alternatives: &quot;Strict&quot; has been named as
a better term. I do not like strict. It implies that the standard
installation is not strict. Or that the default rules were not
strict. In fact they are very strict. Every single one of them.
It's just that they are more focused on less delicate aspects
of the requests. 

So I think the term does not work as it misleads the user into
making the wrong assumptions. You could say that running
the CRS in anomaly scoring mode and setting a threshold of &gt;5
is un-strict. But the individual rules are all strict from my
point of view.

This is even more true, as we have Ryan Barnett's proposal to
use &quot;aggressive&quot;. I think aggressive trumps strict as it 
sounds more like a gradual setting in my ears (both terms
exist in German as well, so maybe these are false friends
for me and their meaning is a wee bit different in English).

So this the new featureset would allow us to adjust how aggressive the
core rule set is. That does not sound too bad. It reminds me of a &quot;teeth
metaphor&quot; is use at times. A strong ruleset has strong teeth. By tuning
false positives, you pull a few of the teeth while keeping most of them
in place. The level of aggression adjusting with this new setting, would
thus add more teeth and the ruleset would thus become more aggressive. I
guess it's not overly wrong to think of piranhas in a pond.

The root of the term comes with the idea of active defense.
It lets me thing of a strike back. Look up the term
aggressive on The Merriam Webster dictionary. All the
definitions point in that direction:
<A HREF="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aggressive">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aggressive</A>
Aggressive always means that you not only defend, but you attack
as well.

(paranoia is entirely different in this regard. It does not
imply any counter strike)

So I think aggressive does not entirely meet the character of the new
functionality, which is in line with the rest of the core rules set in
being entirely defensive. It just block attacks. It absolutely does not
attempt to shut down the client, inject malware into the response or
launch a DoS attack against the source IP address (which would all be
possible with the right set of rules).

And what would be the complete term? Level of Aggression or 
Level of Aggressiveness, Aggressiveness Setting? That all springs
to mind. And that just does not sounds very cool in my ears.
Or outrightly negative (&quot;Level of Aggression!&quot;).

So all in all, I think we should work with paranoia. It's the best
I can think of right now. And I thought about this a lot.

But now let me hear what you think about it!

Please do not take too long. My first pull request is almost
ready, so let's come to a resolution in the next few days.

Best regards,

Christian
