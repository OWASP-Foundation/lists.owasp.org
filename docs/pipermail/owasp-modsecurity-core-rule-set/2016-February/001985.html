<PRE>Hello,

I like the term 'paranoia level' the most. It doesn't sound negative
to me. And during these discussions I already got used to it.

The term strict I like a little less. We often hear the word
combination &#8216;strict mode&#8217; which can either have the state disabled or
enabled, 0 or 1. But that&#8217;s my interpretation.
In contrast, I think the term paranoia intuitively allows multiple
levels. How much we protect or defend ourselves depends on how
paranoid we are.

I don't like aggressive. The term aggressive implies violence. But
that, again, is just my feeling.

I would choose 'paranoia level'. But I could also live with strict.

Regards,
Franziska

&gt;<i> Hi Christian,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You make some very good points! Meanwhile there seems to be a correlation

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,

</I>&gt;<i> We have finished the list of rule candidates for our little

</I>&gt;<i> and I think it is time to sort out the naming question
</I>&gt;<i> before submitting the first pull request with the basic mechanics.
</I>&gt;<i> (-&gt; see <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_ModSec_CRS_Paranoia_Mode">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_ModSec_CRS_Paranoia_Mode</A>
</I>&gt;<i> for an explanation of the 4 pull requests planned)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I started out this project with the idea of an &quot;on/off&quot; setting.
</I>&gt;<i> Hence the idea of &quot;mode&quot;. However, it became clear we are going
</I>&gt;<i> to work with a &quot;level&quot; ranging from 0-4 instead. So the idea of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mode&quot; no longer really applies. We need to find something better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But of course, the core question is, if this should be called
</I>&gt;<i> paranoia, paranoid, strict or agressive or something else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I opted for paranoia from the start and I still think it is the
</I>&gt;<i> right term. However, there has been opposition and we need to find
</I>&gt;<i> a solution everybody can agree with. I also think this is an
</I>&gt;<i> important discussion, as it is a non-technical discussion. So
</I>&gt;<i> everybody can chime in without being an expert and without running
</I>&gt;<i> lengthy tests in his lab.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me open the discussion with my reasoning why &quot;paranoia&quot; is the
</I>&gt;<i> right term. I will then continue to discuss the other options
</I>&gt;<i> and then you can respond and tell me why I am wrong and why the
</I>&gt;<i> other options are much better suited....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Paranoia&quot; is the new normal. The more the attacks evolve and the
</I>&gt;<i> more servers we configure, the more we realise, there is no real
</I>&gt;<i> security without being paranoid. So while paranoia used to be
</I>&gt;<i> a negative term, it is getting a more and more positive connotation;
</I>&gt;<i> especially in IT security.
</I>&gt;<i> Google the terms
</I>&gt;<i> paranoid information security
</I>&gt;<i> and you will get 2M hits. One of the top ones is
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.darkreading.com/operations/the-perfect-infosec-mindset-paranoia-+-skepticism/a/d-id/1297596">http://www.darkreading.com/operations/the-perfect-infosec-mindset-paranoia-+-skepticism/a/d-id/1297596</A>
</I>&gt;<i> where the author says paranoia is the standard mindset now
</I>&gt;<i> (hence paranoia mode) and that you need to pair this with
</I>&gt;<i> skepticism (in other words: the tuning of your ruleset).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other hits include the following titles:
</I>&gt;<i> 13 Security and Privacy Tips for the Truly Paranoid
</I>&gt;<i> Security for the Paranoid - SecurityFocus
</I>&gt;<i> I became paranoid with computer security issues, I always ...
</I>&gt;<i> The paranoid CISO | CSO Online
</I>&gt;<i> Computer-Security Paranoia
</I>&gt;<i> openssl - How paranoid should the average user be about ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking through some of these hits, I get the felling that those
</I>&gt;<i> who really care about security acknowledge that they are paranoid
</I>&gt;<i> and that they think that is the right attitude.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also remember reading about paranoid security settings 10-20 years ago
</I>&gt;<i> and I would skip them immediately. Now, when looking at a new software
</I>&gt;<i> or product, the term paranoia immediately catches my eye and I read
</I>&gt;<i> about the most paranoid options first and then decide if the product is
</I>&gt;<i> any good. Without paranoia options, I think it must be a happy sunshine
</I>&gt;<i> hippy thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, the term &quot;PARANOID_MODE&quot; is already there, even if it has
</I>&gt;<i> not been in wide use in the 2.2.X series of rules:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.2.X&gt; grep -r -i paranoi | wc -l
</I>&gt;<i> 9
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Merriam-Wester dictionary has multiple definitions for paranoia.
</I>&gt;<i> One of them is:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;a tendency on the part of an individual or group toward excessive or
</I>&gt;<i> irrational suspiciousness and distrustfulness of others&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the adjectives &quot;excessive&quot;, &quot;irrational&quot; &quot;distrustful&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> characterise our new functionality very well: When raising the level,
</I>&gt;<i> you are enabling additional rules, which will cause an excessive number
</I>&gt;<i> of false positives due to a general distrustful attitude towards user
</I>&gt;<i> submitted input.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally, two years down the line, ModSecurity (Core Rules) discussion
</I>&gt;<i> will run like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Man, I should install ModSecurity and the Core Rules on my server,
</I>&gt;<i> but I heard false positives are going to kill me.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;No worries, as long as you keep the paranoia setting low, false
</I>&gt;<i> positives are minimal.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two weeks ago, the register ran a story about
</I>&gt;<i> Rob Joyce, head of NSA's Tailored Access Operations:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/28/nsas_top_hacking_boss_explains_how_to_protect_your_network_from_his_minions/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/28/nsas_top_hacking_boss_explains_how_to_protect_your_network_from_his_minions/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> The article closed with the register quoting Joyce:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;At the end of the day it all boils down to knowing your network,
</I>&gt;<i> he said, and it&#8217;s vital that IT administrators pick up their game
</I>&gt;<i> and get paranoid about attacks.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well said. And the core rules paranoia feature is going to help
</I>&gt;<i> with this in a controlled way without killing you with
</I>&gt;<i> false positives on the first day of the installation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But let's look at the alternatives: &quot;Strict&quot; has been named as
</I>&gt;<i> a better term. I do not like strict. It implies that the standard
</I>&gt;<i> installation is not strict. Or that the default rules were not
</I>&gt;<i> strict. In fact they are very strict. Every single one of them.
</I>&gt;<i> It's just that they are more focused on less delicate aspects
</I>&gt;<i> of the requests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I think the term does not work as it misleads the user into
</I>&gt;<i> making the wrong assumptions. You could say that running
</I>&gt;<i> the CRS in anomaly scoring mode and setting a threshold of &gt;5
</I>&gt;<i> is un-strict. But the individual rules are all strict from my
</I>&gt;<i> point of view.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is even more true, as we have Ryan Barnett's proposal to
</I>&gt;<i> use &quot;aggressive&quot;. I think aggressive trumps strict as it
</I>&gt;<i> sounds more like a gradual setting in my ears (both terms
</I>&gt;<i> exist in German as well, so maybe these are false friends
</I>&gt;<i> for me and their meaning is a wee bit different in English).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So this the new featureset would allow us to adjust how aggressive the
</I>&gt;<i> core rule set is. That does not sound too bad. It reminds me of a &quot;teeth
</I>&gt;<i> metaphor&quot; is use at times. A strong ruleset has strong teeth. By tuning
</I>&gt;<i> false positives, you pull a few of the teeth while keeping most of them
</I>&gt;<i> in place. The level of aggression adjusting with this new setting, would
</I>&gt;<i> thus add more teeth and the ruleset would thus become more aggressive. I
</I>&gt;<i> guess it's not overly wrong to think of piranhas in a pond.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The root of the term comes with the idea of active defense.
</I>&gt;<i> It lets me thing of a strike back. Look up the term
</I>&gt;<i> aggressive on The Merriam Webster dictionary. All the
</I>&gt;<i> definitions point in that direction:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aggressive">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aggressive</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Aggressive always means that you not only defend, but you attack
</I>&gt;<i> as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (paranoia is entirely different in this regard. It does not
</I>&gt;<i> imply any counter strike)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I think aggressive does not entirely meet the character of the new
</I>&gt;<i> functionality, which is in line with the rest of the core rules set in
</I>&gt;<i> being entirely defensive. It just block attacks. It absolutely does not
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to shut down the client, inject malware into the response or
</I>&gt;<i> launch a DoS attack against the source IP address (which would all be
</I>&gt;<i> possible with the right set of rules).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And what would be the complete term? Level of Aggression or
</I>&gt;<i> Level of Aggressiveness, Aggressiveness Setting? That all springs
</I>&gt;<i> to mind. And that just does not sounds very cool in my ears.
</I>&gt;<i> Or outrightly negative (&quot;Level of Aggression!&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So all in all, I think we should work with paranoia. It's the best
</I>&gt;<i> I can think of right now. And I thought about this a lot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But now let me hear what you think about it!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please do not take too long. My first pull request is almost
</I>&gt;<i> ready, so let's come to a resolution in the next few days.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Christian
