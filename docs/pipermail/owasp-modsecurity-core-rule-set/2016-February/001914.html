<PRE>Well I'd argue most of those use hostname. Especially the other uptime monitors which, if external, then only have access via the main LoadBalancer. And, as I say, all of those are under the control of the SysAdmin(s), probably the first thing they tune, and unlikely to ever have to be touched again.

As a counter argument the number of Wordpress attack attempts I've seen, based on IP address on all my sites (none of which run Wordpress btw) suggests to me it's hackers running through IP addresses attempting to find a vulnerable WordPress installation - which probably doesn't take too many IP address attempts ;-)

Thanks,
Barry

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So anything else using IP address is likely a bot iterating through IP addresses and I do think they represent a threat and not just an annoyance and so the CRS should block by default.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also found it eye opening the amount of scanners hitting my sites when I turned ModSecurity on for the first time. Now granted most has likely been scanning my site for years with no issues, and they can cause people to panic when they see the sheer volume for first time, but I still think enlightening none the less.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I'd be more in favour of leaving this in normal mode. Perhaps adding some commented out examples of how to whitelist certain IP addresses from this (or all?) rule(s) if it really is that common a problem that people get overwhelmed by their internal systems using IP address.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Barry
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> P.S. Some great discussions going on. Great to see!

I like blocking that thing out of spite, but that&#8217;s just personal.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It's kind of a mixed bag because we still want ModSecurity to be effective at blocking the easy rift raft (opportunistic attackers) but we want it to be easy to configure. Perhaps we make a 'domain name' configuration in the setup.conf and if it has been configured the rule comes into effect. I don't know that IF they have a domain we see too many false positives, most are things that as walter described, are just laziness. Thoughts?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Why don't we simply move it to paranoia mode? Instead of having to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> understand the additional &quot;domain name&quot; config, a user simply raises the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> paranoia level and ends up with more positives and if he thinks
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> some of these requests are leggit/FPs, he will whitelist them.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That would have the same effect as the &quot;domain name&quot; configuration
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but with a more generic tuning process.
