<PRE>Walter,

Thanks for the further testing.

Really interesting. Our environments are so different. I really
see very few FPs here. But it's not the same type of software
running on the servers.

&gt;<i> This is just from a few days of people getting 403s. So after this experiment, I&#8217;m tending towards saying, this is the type of rule that makes the CRS scary to use, even if the rule is effective against RFI.

</I>&gt;<i> Of course if the default paranoia level is nonzero and it stays at that level, we have sorta CRSv2 parity and still a good way to get out of these FP.

I am not sure I understand your last sentence correctly.

If we have most rules at paranoia level 1 and default is
paranoia level 1. Should this rule be a 1 with additional
whitelisting of FPs, or should we assign it a paranoia
level of 2?

I'm OK with both options.

Ahoj,

Christian
