<PRE>We had to disable rules 960009 and 960015 also as they were causing a lot of
false positives for legitimate website visitors.  I think a lot of
valid/different web browsers don't conform to Accept and User agent headers
properly.

Many thanks Barry!I appreciate your sharing of your own experience, pretty
much exactly the same we face here.Yes, one of our apps generates too many
useless connections to Apache. We will work on a new version optimizing this
but it will take a while, perhaps a couple of months, and in the meantime we
will have to work around with an exception rule.Our mod_security install is
standard, e.g. we don't have any exceptions configured yet.So I am not sure
as where to put that rule.OWASP is in this path:
/usr/local/apache/conf/modsec_vendor_configs/OWASPAnd there's only conf file
there: modsecurity_crs_10_setup.confIs it OK to place the @ipmatch exception
rule in a file namedmodsecurity_crs_15_localrules.confunder this same
folder?  Tks a lot!All the best!Luiz

</I>&gt;<i> Date: Wed, 13 May 2015 10:07:24 +0100
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would work though I personally prefer to use @ipMatch which also
</I>allows you to match multiple IPs:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SecRule REMOTE_ADDR &quot;@ipMatch XXX.YYY.Z.WWW XXX.YYY.Z.VVVV&quot;
</I>&quot;id:1000,phase:2,t:none,pass,nolog,ctl:ruleRemoveById=960009&quot; 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A few other things to note:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) 960009 is a phase 2 rule and you have specified phase 1 in your rule
</I>below. I'm pretty sure that rules cannot see other rules outside of their
phase so it needs to be in the same phase. So I've updated this to phase 2
in my version above.
&gt;<i> 2) Your rule must have it's own id (as of ModSecurity 2.7) so I've 
</I>&gt;<i> given it an id of 1000. Make sure this doesn't clash with any existing 
</I>&gt;<i> rule you have. Principal is anything less than 99,999 are your own 
</I>&gt;<i> use. See here for more info: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual#id">https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual#id</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) You could disable ModSecurity completely for internal addresses with a
</I>ctl:ruleEngine=off rule. Personally I don't like that as I want them on for
testing purposes so we're not caught out with a rule that only runs in
production so think just disabling the specific rules is a better option.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However I think it would be good to understand why you need to do this at
</I>all.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Rule 960009 checks for requests missing a user agent. All decent browsers
</I>send a user agent hence why this rule is in place as the lack of a user
agent is probably due to some script or such like, so it is a good rule.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So why are you getting so many requests from internal addresses without a
</I>user agent and should you fix that rather than add the above rule to get
around that?
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can think of two reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Monitoring scripts or tools which are not quite as compliant as web
</I>browsers. So perhaps change these to also report the user agent as that
could be useful information to know (though with third party tools that
might not always be possible).
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Needlessly connecting to Apache. We use Apache to server up static
</I>pages and also in proxy mode to pass dynamic requests on to an application
server. After installing mod security and noticing similar to you, we
investigated and discovered some of our dynamic applications were needlessly
making calls to Apache, just to connect back to the app server again. It was
actually better to change them to connect directly to the app server, which
resolved the issue, as well as saving network traffic and a (admittedly
small amount of) Apache load.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Barry

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi! 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know if anyone experiences the same issue as us here, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suppose at least this might contribute to all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I installed OWASP rules on a Centos running 2 Joomla sites with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nearly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5,000 unique visitors a day. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was fortunate enough to identify and disable 12 rules that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delivered a bunch of false positives (one of them locked down the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server when one of us in the team submitted a security scan from
</I>CSF/LFD...).
&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, now it is running fine but one rule still delivers near 1,000 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; false positives a day and oddly enough having our own server IP as
</I>source!
&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And severity level for ALL of the hits are NOTICE. So, this is not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so much troublesome, except for the extra load on the server and the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; log size. I rotate it automatically everynight but it comes out at 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nearly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 0,3 GB as standard size. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, what I am trying to do but don't know exactly how is to implent 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something like this in a file named modsecurity_crs_15_localrules.conf:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SecRule REMOTE_ADDR &quot;@streq XXX.YYY.Z.WWW&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;phase:1,t:none,pass,nolog,ctl:ruleRemoveById=960009&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where XXX.YYY.Z.WWW is my server's IP address. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does anyone know if this is correct and if it can actually work to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keep my server out of this rule execution?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tks a lot! 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All the best!

Hi Barry!Well, it didn't work...This is what I did:My mod_security conf and
rules files are set up like this:
              

modsecurity_crs_15_customrules.conf file has only this line:
SecRule REMOTE_ADDR &quot;@ipMatch 999.99.99.99&quot;
&quot;id:1000,phase:2,t:none,pass,nolog,ctl:ruleRemoveById=960009&quot;
I restarted Apache, but rule 960009 still process that IP as source.
What did I do wrong?
There is also a file named /usr/local/apache/conf/modsec2.whitelist.conf
with just this on it:
# ConfigServer ModSecurity whitelist file&lt;LocationMatch .*&gt;&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;
I'm confused, don't know in which files this directive should go or what
else should I have done.Tks!All the best!Luiz
