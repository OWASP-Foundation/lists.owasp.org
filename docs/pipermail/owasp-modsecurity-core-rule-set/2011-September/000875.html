<PRE>I am excited to announce that today Trustwave has released two new commercial offerings for open source ModSecurity users -

 *   ModSecurity Rules from Trustwave SpiderLabs &#8211; <A HREF="http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/commercial/rules/">http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/commercial/rules/</A>
    *   The rules cover vulnerabilities within public software (commercial and open source)
    *   We have 4 main attack categories that we cover (current # of rules for each is listed):
       *   SQL Injection - 4536
       *   Cross-site Scripting - 4155
       *   Remote File Inclusion - 4276
       *   Local File Inclusion &#8211; 551
       *   Total &#8211; 13,518
    *   We also have rules files that group common software packages together (WordPress, Joomla, osCommerce, etc&#8230;)
    *   We also provide two versions of the rules depending upon if you want to integrate these rules with the OWASP CRS or if you wan to run them stand-alone.

 *   Commercial Support - <A HREF="http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/commercial/support/">http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/commercial/support/</A>

Here is a blog post from Trustwave SpiderLabs' Senior VP Nick Percoco on the new offerings - <A HREF="http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2011/09/trustwave-releases-new-modsecurity-rules-and-support.html">http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2011/09/trustwave-releases-new-modsecurity-rules-and-support.html</A>
