<PRE>This is the CRS newsletter covering the period from Early February until
today.

We held our monthly community chat. We had quite a few people stop by.

   - csanders
   - lifeforms
   - franbuehler
   - emphazer
   - dune73
   - agi
   - squared
   - fzipi_
   - spartantri

Our agenda from before the chat is available here
&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues/1026">https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues/1026</A>&gt;. During
the chat we discussed the following:



We added support for ModSecurity-v3/Apache and Modsecurity-v2/Nginx to the CRS
Support ModSecurity Docker Repos
&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/CRS-support/modsecurity-docker">https://github.com/CRS-support/modsecurity-docker</A>&gt;. These will be used
when testing before a release. Additionally, we will be adding testing with
Nginx+FTW in addition to Apache+FTW.

A blog about the current CI process will be created for next month.

Issue #990 &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues/990">https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues/990</A>&gt;
status
:<i> Only issue was with FTW failing tests, this has since been fixed. This
</I>was merged.

CRS Summit at AppSec EU:  The proposed CRS Summit will be on July 4, 4pm in
London, the closing day of the trainings, the night before the real
conference starts.

Dune73, Tin Zaw, and csanders-git submitted CFPs to AppSec EU.

#1013 FP resolution status: was merged.

#994 File detection: was built against ubuntu with ModSecurity on Apache.
This was causing conflicts. We decided as an organization to switch our CI
testing env to Ubuntu (instead of fedora).

#989 Fix Regression Tests: For some reasons even though tests were fixed,
these still failed, we'll be rebasing and that should fix the issue.

remaining @azhao155 issues represent actual issues with how the rules are
written.

CRS 3.1 release date shooting for May 2018

csanders-git put forth a number of options for increasing project
management capabilities within the project. A further email will be sent
out.
