<PRE>Hi Mirko,

This is very interesting!

We have had no formal project going on, but it&#8217;s always a personal interest of mine, since I&#8217;ve always felt some friction with the ModSec rule language, and the large amount of boilerplate that we have to include in the CRS. In the past, I&#8217;ve dreamt about simpler rule syntaxes to facilitate CRS development. I&#8217;ve once put up a ramble and sketch inspired on a Python-like syntax, which can be found here: <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/lifeforms/28086fbdd17a2504faf488fe217380ea">https://gist.github.com/lifeforms/28086fbdd17a2504faf488fe217380ea</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://gist.github.com/lifeforms/28086fbdd17a2504faf488fe217380ea">https://gist.github.com/lifeforms/28086fbdd17a2504faf488fe217380ea</A>&gt;

For instance (from the above gist), I would love to write CRS rules like this:

rule 933110:
	if lowercase(UPLOAD_FILENAMES) rx '.*\.(?:php\d*|phtml)\.*$':
		msg 'PHP Injection Attack: PHP Script File Upload Found'
		block_anomaly critical php_injection

However, at the time, I hadn&#8217;t considered the use case of systems automatically generating rules or exclusions. For such a case, a JSON or YAML based serialization would be more useful, as it would not require parsing, evades problems with quoting, etc. I like how you have thought about data types.

I am currently looking at lua-resty-waf, which uses JSON to describe rules. If you are thinking of a new rule syntax in a JSON or YAML like exchange format, it might be useful to see how this was done:
<A HREF="https://github.com/p0pr0ck5/lua-resty-waf/blob/master/rules/41000_sqli.json">https://github.com/p0pr0ck5/lua-resty-waf/blob/master/rules/41000_sqli.json</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/p0pr0ck5/lua-resty-waf/blob/master/rules/41000_sqli.json">https://github.com/p0pr0ck5/lua-resty-waf/blob/master/rules/41000_sqli.json</A>&gt;
I have to try converting CRS 3.1-dev to lua-resty-waf format to see how that ends up.

I have to say, as a human, I find writing JSON or YAML to be not the greatest experience, but at this point in time, one of these serialization formats is a must have for integration. I agree with you that the language should be declarative, but the WAF engine will in reality still be running its phases and rules sequentially, making ordering/state relevant etc, hence why I was thinking more of code than a JSON dump. (Of course you can achieve the same things with both)

It would be amazing to have a universal &#8220;Rosetta stone&#8221; which has possible YAML, JSON, and even simple code syntaxes as frontends, as long as it can output a ModSec .conf file. It would be a useful sandbox for experimenting with various ideas. And it would also help make supporting other WAFs easier.

Anyway, I would be very interested to chat about these things at AppSecEU :)

Cheers!
WH
