Subject: [JIRA] Resolved: (CORERULES-6) Some core rules files have not been

Ryan Barnett resolved CORERULES-6.
----------------------------------

       Resolution: Fixed
    Fix Version/s:     (was: 1.6.2)
                   2.0.0

The new CRS v2.0.0 now uses the block action within rules so that they will 
defer to the SecDefaultAction setting.

&gt;<i> Some core rules files have not been upgraded to use the SecDefaultAction 
</I>given in file 10
&gt;<i> 
</I>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 Key: CORERULES-6
</I>&gt;<i>                 URL: <A HREF="https://www.modsecurity.org/tracker/browse/CORERULES-6">https://www.modsecurity.org/tracker/browse/CORERULES-6</A>
</I>&gt;<i>             Project: Core Rules
</I>&gt;<i>          Issue Type: Bug
</I>&gt;<i>      Security Level: Normal
</I>&gt;<i>    Affects Versions: 1.6.1
</I>&gt;<i>         Environment: modsecurity 2.5.9  -- Core Rule Set ver. 1.6.1
</I>&gt;<i>            Reporter: john smith
</I>&gt;<i>            Assignee: Ryan Barnett
</I>&gt;<i>             Fix For: 2.0.0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Earlier rules files had a SecDefaultAction in each file which set pass as the 
</I>default action.  In 1.6.1, the only SecDefaultAction is in  _crs_10_config 
which (as in earlier rule sets) sets deny as the default action.   Several 
rules still depend on the assumption that pass is the default although this is 
no loger the case.
&gt;<i> This also effectively eliminates the difference between main rule set and the 
</I>&quot;optional&quot; rule set.
&gt;<i> Although several rules in several files are affected, a specifi example would 
</I>be all the rules in _crs_55_marketing.conf, which without modification of the 
rules or addition of a SecDefaultAction to set pass, have the effect of denying 
the major search engine crawlers.
&gt;<i> Several examples in the documentation also seem to implicitly assume that 
</I>'pass' is the default action even though this is no loger the case.
