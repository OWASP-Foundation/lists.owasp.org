I've attempted to set up fail2ban to ban attackers that trigger 
modsecurity rules.? But fail2ban is....failing to ban them.? I get 
plenty of bans based on apache-auth and fakegooglebot rules, but never 
on modsecurity.

My original filter in apache-modsecurity.conf looked like this (I 
believe this was the default)

failregex = ^%(_apache_error_client)s ModSecurity:? (\[.*?\] )*Access 
denied with code [45]\d\d.*$

After noticing that nothing got banned, based on a post in Server Fault 
I changed it to

failregex = ^%(_apache_error_client)s .*ModSecurity:? (\[.*?\] )*Access 
denied with code [45]\d\d.*$

But still nothing.

Has anyone tried this, and gotten it to work? (I am pretty ignorant of 
regex's and have just been looking for a canned solution).

Thanks in advance.

Bill

Hi Bill,

It may not be the best idea to ban clients just based into a single log entry, a single failed request that trigger a false positive may cause a lot of issues, for example with some proxies adding cookies with json content which often cause a false positive not because of the client but because of the added cookie.

You may better track client ip in persistent collections to track users which have caused X critical requests to then log that and use that alert instead for blocking with fail to ban.

As for the regex, copy the message from the log and paste it as target string into regex101.com (sanitize it first!) so you can see with colors if you got the match you want.

This assumes you receive direct connections from end users, all clients using NAT (e.g. corporate clients) may look in the logs as a single client and blocking it will block all those clients.

Cheers!

Chaim,

Yes, your answer definitely helps. Some follow-up questions:

 1 - When you say ARGS contains the "extracted contents" of the body, is
this equivalent to the entire body. If not, what exactly are the "extracted
contents"?
 2 - If my content is XML and I have disabled the XML parser, will ARGS or
XML:/* contain anything?
 3 - If my content is JSON and I have disabled the JSON parser, will ARGS
contain anything?
 4 - Is there a JSON-equivalent to XML:/*?

Thanks,
Jai

Message-ID: <CAE8hE=pwXgm85BSd_kJaaG_vERWrXW0UMjjLYyFs9E65mN4JBw@mail.gmail.com>

This is the CRS newsletter covering the period from Early April until May
7th.

We held our monthly community chat. It is a busy time so we had quite a few
people unavailable. Thanks to all those who attended:

   - csanders
   - Oladon_work
   - lifeforms
   - emphazer
   - franbuehler
   - squared

Our agenda from before the chat is available here
<https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/issues/1077>. During
the chat we discussed the following:


   - *Travis fails due to docker issues*. This was an issued which csanders
   worked to resolve before the meeting. It was due to a change in the
   underlying CRS maintained ModSecurity Docker image (modsecurity-docker #7
   <https://github.com/CRS-support/modsecurity-docker/pull/7>). While this
   reduced the size of the underlying image it removed certificates needed
   query github, which ended up causing builds to fail.
   - *Review of PR #1076
   <https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/pull/1076> for
   inclusion in 3.1*: franbuehler and lifeforms had looked at the PR and
   agreed it added features needed for 3.1. They both said they would test
   more in the coming weeks to ensure it made it into 3.1 with minimal
impact. squared
   said he would test this to ensure it worked with libmodsecurity.
   - *Release of 3.1*: It was suggested previously that we'd have a hard
   code stop on 3.1 features on May 7th if we were ready. We decided that the
   features we were preparing should make it into 3.1, but nothing after
   that. These features included PR #1076
   <https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/pull/1076>
   (additional monitoring or hybrid paranoia level settings), #1045
   <https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/pull/1045>
   (malicious file upload detection) and CPanel rule exclusions. emphazer said
   he would work on the CPanel rules within the next two weeks. It was agreed
   that PR 1076 could be completed within two weeks likely. At this time we'd
   generate an RC1 of CRS 3.1
   - *Other open PRs*: csanders had closed a number of the lingering test
   related issues that were blocking 3.1 release. He also committed to fixing
   the NGINX docker image before the 3.1 release. Franbuehler had reviewed
   #1045 <https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/pull/1045>,
   she had found some issues that were acknowledged by spartantri  that
   needed to be addressed before a merge.
   - *Community Summit on July 4*: Dune73 has been working in the backend
   to coordinate this event. It is coming along nicely a dozen confirmed
   participants from various companies. CPanel has committed to sponsor the
   dinner (thanks CPanel). Official registration will be open soon via
   AppSecEU website.

*Announcements:*


   - *Franbuehler gave a talk about ModSec CRS in DevOps last week at the
   DevOpsDays ZH (Zurich), slides forthcoming, an associated git repo can be
   found here <https://github.com/franbuehler/modsecurity-crs-rp>.*

*The next community chats will be held on the following dates:*


   - June 4, 2018 20:30 CET
   - Live at AppSecEU and Online July 4th, 2018 14:30 CET **Time Change**
   - Aug 6, 2018 20:30 CET

Hello Christian and Team,

I'm interested in the community's thoughts on having CRS rules or Custom Rules for detecting attacks against WebSocket connections, specifically DoS and Websocket header tampering.

Thanks.

Hello Hiranmayi,

Having them would be very interesting of course.

It is not so clear how far you can get. I usually declare that ModSec is no
good fighting standard DoS attacks. As for websockets, you may face a problem
where ModSecurity does not give you proper access to the traffic in question.

Checking standard HTTP headers should not be a proble, though and writing a
few rules for the websocket use case seems feasible.

Ahoj,

Christian

Subject: [Owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set] Proposal for another language for
	CRS
Message-ID: <DB767B90-3D5B-4A18-AAAE-D90695F0F51B@gmail.com>

Hello

Let me introduce myself first. I?m working in the realm of developing Web Application Firewalls for more than 13 years now. 
Currently I?m working for a company which is using modsecurity and the CRS as one component of the WAF part of their product.

In this role, we are thinking about how we can improve and develop the language, especially the language in which the CRS rules are described.

I wrote down some first thoughts about this here:

https://github.com/avinetworks/owasp-crs-technical-discussion/blob/master/language-draft.md <https://github.com/avinetworks/owasp-crs-technical-discussion/blob/master/language-draft.md>

More detailed specification and code will follow in the next couple of weeks, but I would like to have
this development as public as possible and start the discussion as soon as possible.

I would like to get feedback about these ideas from the community, so please feel free to comment.

I will be on the AppSec EU in July in London and would like to discuss the ideas in more details there.

Greetings

Mirko,
I'm excited to review your work. Most of us are very familiar with the
current language but that doesn't mean that we couldn't benefit
significantly from considering other, more modern approaches. I for one
certainly like the YAML format (makes it easier to read). I look forward to
talking about this more.

Hi Mirko,

This is very interesting!

We have had no formal project going on, but it?s always a personal interest of mine, since I?ve always felt some friction with the ModSec rule language, and the large amount of boilerplate that we have to include in the CRS. In the past, I?ve dreamt about simpler rule syntaxes to facilitate CRS development. I?ve once put up a ramble and sketch inspired on a Python-like syntax, which can be found here: https://gist.github.com/lifeforms/28086fbdd17a2504faf488fe217380ea <https://gist.github.com/lifeforms/28086fbdd17a2504faf488fe217380ea>

For instance (from the above gist), I would love to write CRS rules like this:

rule 933110:
	if lowercase(UPLOAD_FILENAMES) rx '.*\.(?:php\d*|phtml)\.*$':
		msg 'PHP Injection Attack: PHP Script File Upload Found'
		block_anomaly critical php_injection

However, at the time, I hadn?t considered the use case of systems automatically generating rules or exclusions. For such a case, a JSON or YAML based serialization would be more useful, as it would not require parsing, evades problems with quoting, etc. I like how you have thought about data types.

I am currently looking at lua-resty-waf, which uses JSON to describe rules. If you are thinking of a new rule syntax in a JSON or YAML like exchange format, it might be useful to see how this was done:
https://github.com/p0pr0ck5/lua-resty-waf/blob/master/rules/41000_sqli.json <https://github.com/p0pr0ck5/lua-resty-waf/blob/master/rules/41000_sqli.json>
I have to try converting CRS 3.1-dev to lua-resty-waf format to see how that ends up.

I have to say, as a human, I find writing JSON or YAML to be not the greatest experience, but at this point in time, one of these serialization formats is a must have for integration. I agree with you that the language should be declarative, but the WAF engine will in reality still be running its phases and rules sequentially, making ordering/state relevant etc, hence why I was thinking more of code than a JSON dump. (Of course you can achieve the same things with both)

It would be amazing to have a universal ?Rosetta stone? which has possible YAML, JSON, and even simple code syntaxes as frontends, as long as it can output a ModSec .conf file. It would be a useful sandbox for experimenting with various ideas. And it would also help make supporting other WAFs easier.

Anyway, I would be very interested to chat about these things at AppSecEU :)

Cheers!
WH

Subject: [Owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set] Wordpress admin-ajax.php issues
Message-ID: <CA+seigrJRnux4jjNUN4AOf7u14UKUTjwfQhQF1rT5qXDFcPLeA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I have installed OWASP rules set
including REQUEST-903.9002-WORDPRESS-EXCLUSION-RULES.conf

However, I get 500 error on admin-ajax.php when trying to use backup plugin
through admin page

Is there any information how to overcome this issue?

I can provide access to my AWS instance if required.

Thanks for your help.

Best regards,
Taya

Hey Taya,

Getting a 500 is a bit odd. But I take it you have made sure it is ModSec and
not something else. The full error log / audit log would help.

Ahoj,

Christian
