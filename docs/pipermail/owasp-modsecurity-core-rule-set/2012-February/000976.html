<PRE>Greetings everyone,
Please excuse the cross-posting but I wanted to make sure that everyone saw this post.  We are going to start an initiative to re-architect the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set.  We, SpiderLabs, want this to be a &quot;community-based&quot; effort where we openly discuss various methods of architecting the CRS so that they provide the most value.  Here are a few goals -

 1.  To make the CRS more accurate &#8211; which means to significantly reduce the # of false positives.  Most users want move to a blocking mode but can't until they are comfortable with the accuracy of the rules.
 2.  To make exceptions easier &#8211; there are a number of scenarios where exceptions need to be made to exclude certain parameters or URLs from inspection.
 3.  To increase the security coverage &#8211; which means to reduce the # of false negatives.  We don't want to miss any legitimate attacks.

We will be starting a string of discussion threads on the OWASP ModSecurity CRS mail-list -
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-modsecurity-core-rule-set</A>

If you would like to participate in this project &#8211; I suggest that you sign up for the mail-list.  We want feedback from all different types of ModSecurity users &#8211; home users, corporate users, government, education, hosting providers, etc&#8230;  Let us know what your challenges are so that we can fix them!
