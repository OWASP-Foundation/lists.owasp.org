<PRE>I am separating out these discussion topics into separate emails for
better tracking purposes.

Comments inline below.

&gt;<i>Hi Ryan, hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>my experience with the core-rules is only limited. I installed the rules
</I>&gt;<i>and tweaked
</I>&gt;<i>them to match my needs and generally use my own rules for research/toy
</I>&gt;<i>purposes. Based

</I>&gt;<i>mangling the
</I>&gt;<i>existing rules into more complicated ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So, I'd like to start with what I am missing a bit in the current rule

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Transparency
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     To a high degree the concept of the rules need to be transparent to
</I>&gt;<i>the user. If
</I>&gt;<i>     it takes one more than two days, to read/understand the structure of
</I>&gt;<i>the rules, it
</I>&gt;<i>     might shrug people off from using the rules in the first step.
</I>&gt;<i>     Likewise, the outcome (alerts) of the rules needs to be
</I>&gt;<i>understandable to anyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The switch from the old (pre 2.x) version to anomaly scoring was a
</I>&gt;<i>good idea, but
</I>&gt;<i>     the communication was suboptimal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Any central place where we have a documentation on the scale of the
</I>&gt;<i>anomaly score?
</I>&gt;<i>     What is a &quot;good&quot; threshold meant to be? Can we fix this beforehand?
</I>&gt;<i>Can you share
</I>&gt;<i>     experiences with tests, e.g. the average score when hitting some app
</I>&gt;<i>with sqlmap?
</I>&gt;<i>     How are the severity levels being used? I know they exist, but I do
</I>&gt;<i>not have a clue
</I>&gt;<i>     on how consistent and with which intention they're spread in the
</I>&gt;<i>rules.

I agree that we need better transparency between SpiderLabs and the
community which is why we are starting this effort :)  What we don't want
to have happen is that we suddenly make all these sweeping changes that
catches the community off-guard (which admittedly is what happened in the
move from CRS v1 to v2).  We want collaboration with the community.

We have wiki-based documentation on the SourceForge site here -

We can certainly add in new wiki pages for these topics.  We just need to
agree on formatting and how to present the topics.  We have a lot of
source material for this in the blog posts, but I feel that the blog posts
are in an unorganized state and not easily referenced by (new) users.
Perhaps that is a starting point - I can create a page that lists all of
the ModSecurity blog  topics on a wiki page.
