<PRE>Hello all,

I am not really a network guy. I have a small home server running Fedora
13. As well as hosting my small family web site it is also a mail server
running Procmail, Spamassassin, Dovecot and Squirrelmail. 

I also have an iPhone.

I was thrilled, recently, to discover an application called z-push which
allows me to &quot;push&quot; emails from my server to my iPhone. It uses a php
script running php-imap on the server to spoof
Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync. It works brilliantly with Mod_security
disabled. ModSec however blocks it. I have tried creating a local rule
in modsecurity_localrules.conf but I couldn't get it quite right - plus
I was not sure what the safest way to allow this access would be without
opening up the server too much...

I get two types of report in the console:


METHOD: POST   URI: /Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync 
1) Request content type is not allowed by policy 2) Inbound Anomaly Score (Total Inbound Score: 10, SQLi=, XSS=): Request content type is not allowed by policy

and

METHOD: OPTIONS   URI: /Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync 
 Access denied with code 405 (phase 2). Match of &quot;rx ^(GET|POST|HEAD)$&quot; against &quot;REQUEST_METHOD&quot; required.

The second of those, obviously, is actually blocked. It is blocked by a
rule which I put into my local rules having worked through Magnus
Mischel's book.

This is the rule in question:
# Rule to block non-standard methods (See Modsec book p50)
SecRule REQUEST_METHOD &quot;!^(GET|POST|HEAD)$&quot; &quot;deny,status:405&quot;


Please see below the detail for the denial. How can I craft a safe rule
to allow this through?

Thanks in advance....

Mark
