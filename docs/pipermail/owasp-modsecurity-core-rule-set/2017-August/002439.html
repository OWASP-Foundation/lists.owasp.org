<PRE>Thank you about your reply. I know about the exclusion, but I don&#8217;t think this is the perfect solution, because if I exclude all the false positive rules there will be 2-3 maybe working rules at all :) Maybe they should be tunned? What is going on when the anomaly score is higher - this I couldn&#8217;t understand - users are not blocked or what? If I understand right I can start with high anomaly score for all rule with equal score until I tune them perfectly.

In the nginx I have ratelimits and I prefer to start with most common Wordpress / Joomla hacks rule that can stop some part of the hacks, because this is the biggest problem

Best regards,
Georgi Georgiev

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am deploying mod security with nginx in shared hosting environment and most of the websites are Wordpress, Joomla and drupal. I don&#8217;t want to rewrite all the rules of owasp to minimize the false positives. Also, I searched for specific for Wordpress or Joomla ruleset but couldn&#8217;t find such thing (it would be very resourceful to research for every Wordpress and Joomla hack, even the most famouse one and to write rules about it, also to read how to write rules :)). Even, if I put mod security initially in a mode that does not block , only to log it would be very hard to see very queer if it&#8217;s false positive or whether it come from evil sources.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I read that right practice is to change the score of the anomaly but didn&#8217;t understand it at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, I would like to ask you how you deal with this? I know that false positives will be there all the time, but how you minimize them? Write your own ruleset? Is there any paid ruleset that you can recommend (it think that I found only one paid and many people cry from it). Just I want to explain me the process you follow with the rules :)
