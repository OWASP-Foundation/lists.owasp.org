<PRE>I had intended to still package up the latest CRS with modsec whenever I 
make a release.  The CRS is now in its own tree under SVN, so I just 
pull the latest CRS and include it in the modsec release.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) CRS is now an OWASP project and it will more than likely be developed

</I>&gt;<i> be developed on their own outside of the Mod source code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The release cycles of the CRS are going to be much more frequent and
</I>&gt;<i> tying it back into adding to the Mod source archive seems like a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> extra work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) We will soon be utilizing the rules-updater.pl script to allow users
</I>&gt;<i> to automatically download the latest rules from our site. I would guess
</I>&gt;<i> that this will become the most often used method for obtaining rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that we should take a cue from Snort and keep the source code
</I>&gt;<i> and the rules separate.
