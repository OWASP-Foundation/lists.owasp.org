<PRE>Hello,

I have some rules that in my particular case are giving false
positives (these  are part of the generic mysql inyections). I have
tried searching in google for the answer to this and the documentation
in the site and the best help I was able to see was that it was needed
to setup the Debug Level at least to 4 or 5 . I have set it to 5 but
now I have an infinite amount of logs. Exactly what would I be looking
for to know what rule matched according to the error in the audit_log?

Thank you!!

Andres
