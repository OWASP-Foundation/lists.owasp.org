--[ Description

BugCON Security Conference is one of the most important security
conferences at Mexico. BugCON 2016 will take place at Mexico City from
November 4th to 5th, 2016.

----[ Background

BugCON Security Conference: Safety is just a myth...! is the biggest
security conference at Mexico since 2008.

mexican beach c[xxx]

--[ Approach

BugCON is merely a technical security conference. BugCON is focused in
getting together security researchers, security professionals,
companies, universities and goverment agencies with the purpose of
showing their latest research, networking with people involved in
security fields and get drunk ;) ... all taking place in an uncensored
environment.

This is the reason why BugCON only accepts really hardcore technical
talks and workshops related with security areas like: research, new
techniques, vulnerabilities, projects, etc. No business talks...
neither &quot;CSI of computers&quot; nor yellow scarves.

presentation and 10 mins Q&amp;A for talks (if you need more time because
