Subject: [Owasp-chennai] Reg. Web Application Security Testing Conferences
Message-ID: <234186.91240.qm@web94812.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

Hi All,
?
I'm extremely happy to join this community. 
?
Just to give a quick intro about me, I'm new to the Web Security domain and really excited to learn a lot of stuffs related to it. I'm working in Verizon Communications @ Chennai.
?
I'd be glad to know if there are any conferences / training sessions related to Web Application Security Testing anywhere in India, so that I can plan to attend them & get valuable insight about the domain!
?
Please keep me posted if you happen to come across any conferences / trainings.
?
Thanks & Regards,
Arun Sundaresh. R
