Well, I'm in the US and I guess I'll have to bear with the minutes.
Is there someway I could dial-in? Or I'll be more than happy to reach out to a point person and get the updates.
Let me know if it works.

All the very best!

Hi All,

     Chennai OWASP chapter is planning to conduct the first Chennai
Chapter meeting during the second or third week of March. I will
announce the exact DateTime & Venue shortly. I would like to know how
many of you are interested in participating in the chapter meeting.



     If you are interested in attending the chapter meeting, revert
back to me. This will help me arrange the meeting smoothly so that
everyone is comfortable.



     The meeting will most likely be on Friday afternoon for at most 2
hours. Do revert to me before 12th March 2009 to plan for this
accordingly.







Thanks & Regards,

Hi All,

     Chennai OWASP chapter is planning to conduct the first Chennai
Chapter meeting during the second or third week of March. I will
announce the exact DateTime & Venue shortly. I would like to know how
many of you are interested in participating in the chapter meeting.



     If you are interested in attending the chapter meeting, revert back
to me. This will help me arrange the meeting smoothly so that everyone
is comfortable.



     The meeting will most likely be on Friday afternoon for at most 2
hours. Do revert to me before 12th March 2009 to plan for this
accordingly.







Thanks & Regards,

Hi,


Whether we would require any identity/security  passes ? As  the venue of
meeting is inside the  premises of a Corporate concern!

Hi All,

      Chennai OWASP chapter is planning to conduct the first Chennai Chapter meeting during the second or third week of March. I will announce the exact DateTime & Venue shortly. I would like to know how many of you are interested in participating in the chapter meeting.

Subject: [Owasp-chennai] Microsoft to release exploitability tool
Message-ID: <C1EB165136AB2B4EA08B012CB9FC9A5B027D86C7@blrx3m10.blr.amer.dell.com>

Dear Members,

Aiming to better identify bugs that could lead to security issues,
Microsoft announced on Wednesday that it planned to release a tool to
help developers classify and assess program crashes.

The tool, known as !exploitable and pronounced "bang exploitable," is a
plugin for the Windows debugger that categorizes crash information using
two hashes, members of Microsoft's Security Science group told
SecurityFocus in a briefing. Using the hashes, which Microsoft called
major and minor hashes, the tool can group crashes that are caused by
the same bug, even if the program executed in different ways to produce
the crashes. The tool also estimates the exploitability of the
vulnerability, rating them as Exploitable, Probably Exploitable,
Possibly Exploitable, and Unknown.

Subject: [Owasp-chennai] HP offers free security tool for Flash developers
Message-ID: <C1EB165136AB2B4EA08B012CB9FC9A5B02842F87@blrx3m10.blr.amer.dell.com>

HP is set to announce on Monday a free tool that developers can use to
check for holes in the Flash applications they write, which can lead to
data leaks and other security problems on Web sites. 

 

HP SWFScan decompiles Flash applications and searches the code for
vulnerabilities and violations of Adobe's best security practices
guidelines, said Billy Hoffman, manager of HP's Web Security Research
Group. The tool works with all versions of Flash.

 

With the Flash Player installed on more than 98 percent of
Internet-connected computers globally, Flash applications are a popular
target for attackers. HP analyzed nearly 4,000 Web apps developed with
the Flash platform and found that 35 percent violate Adobe's security
best practices.

 

For example, encryption keys and other sensitive data have been found
inside client-side Flash code, Hoffman said.

 

Flash, traditionally used for creating animation and games, has been
increasingly used for Web 2.0 apps destined for enterprise use, for
which tighter security measures are required, he said.

 

 

One of our Member asked the question whether a Tool is there to test
,and here you go J

First of all I like to thank our chapter lead Mr.Venki for arranging first
meeting of OWASP Chennai chapter for the year 2009 and cognizant for
sponsoring it. In this meeting I meet most of my former faculty members and
old friends. The only one thing which I missed was lunch ?.   J Jokes
apart... what I missed was networking session.
As rightly said its difficult be hundred percent bang on target or satisfy
everyone on the first attempt itself. I request our chapter lead Mr.Venki to
hold an Ice Breaking session or Networking session in next meeting .As OWASP
the forum of like mined security focused people so that we can interact and
know tips and techniques on dealing the common problems which we are facing
in our day to day working.

Subject: [Owasp-chennai] Owasp Software Assurance Maturity Model
Message-ID: <C1EB165136AB2B4EA08B012CB9FC9A5B0294FD57@blrx3m10.blr.amer.dell.com>

The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization. The resources provided by SAMM will aid in:

 

? Evaluating an organization?s existing

software security practices

 

? Building a balanced software security program

in well-defined iterations

 

? Demonstrating concrete improvements

to a security assurance program

 

? Defining and measuring security-related activities

within an organization

 

SAMM was defined with flexibility in mind such that it can be utilized by small, medium, and large organizations using any style of development. Additionally, this model can be applied organization-wide, for a single line-of-business, or even for an individual project.

 

As an open project, SAMM content shall always remain vendor-neutral and freely available for all to use.

I agree to Zuber & Siva's view that networking session was something that
was missing.

Good that Venki & Umapathy have atleast kickstarted some activity in OWASP
Chennai chapter & are planning to have more such events in the times to
come.

Looking forward to see more and more experts on the topic taking an
opportunity to present interesting sessions.

Though basic techniques & approach while developing/testing web applications
on various platforms would be same for most of the platforms, i would really
appreciate if experts touchbase upon security of platforms such as
Sharepoint, IBM Clearquest etc. I feel this might add value to both the
developers & testers.

Looking forward for an opportunity to present something interesting myself.

Regards
Vivek
