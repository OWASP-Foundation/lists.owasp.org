Subject: [Owasp-chennai] Sony's PlayStation Network and Qriocity hacked
Message-ID: <BANLkTimYdEpomQoVK6ioAyVtwyQNF+iy=A@mail.gmail.com>

By Alex Pham, Los Angeles Times

April 27, 2011

Sony Corp.<https://mail.google.com/topic/economy-business-finance/media-industry/sony-corp.-ORCRP014162.topic>said
hackers had obtained personal data, and possibly credit card
information, of tens of millions of people who have registered for
PlayStation<https://mail.google.com/topic/services-shopping/video-games/playstation-PRDCES000000023.topic>Network,
the company's online game and movie service, as well as Qriocity,
its on-demand digital music service.

"This was a big one," said Bruce Schneier, security technologist and author
of "Beyond Fear" and other books on computer security, referring to the
number of accounts and the scope of information involved.

As of March 31, Sony had 77 million accounts for its PlayStation Network
service, which links users via the Sony PlayStation
3<https://mail.google.com/topic/services-shopping/video-games/playstation-3-PRDCES000000022.topic>video
game console to download games and tap into online services such as
Netflix<https://mail.google.com/topic/economy-business-finance/netflix-inc.-ORCRP010656.topic>'s
video streaming service.

Not all accounts are active, and it's possible that one person can have
multiple accounts.

Hackers who gained access to personal information last week were able to
steal names, addresses, phone numbers, user names, birth dates, email
addresses and passwords, Sony said. The company said it did not know whether
credit card information was stolen.

"While there is no evidence at this time that credit card data was taken, we
cannot rule out the possibility," Sony PlayStation spokesman Patrick Seybold
wrote on the company's blog. "If you have provided your credit card data
through PlayStation Network or Qriocity, out of an abundance of caution we
are advising you that your credit card number (excluding security code) and
expiration date may have been obtained."

Sony last week shut down its PlayStation Network service, saying it had been
the target of an "intrusion," but did not release details until Tuesday.

The delay drew criticism from Sen. Richard
Blumenthal<https://mail.google.com/topic/politics/richard-blumenthal-hpp4069.topic>(D-Conn.),
who fired off a letter to the president of Sony's PlayStation
business in the U.S., Jack Tretton, saying he was "troubled by the failure
of Sony to immediately notify affected customers of the breach and to extend
adequate financial data security protections."

"We learned there was an intrusion April 19 and subsequently shut the
services down," Sony spokesman Patrick Seybold said. "We then brought in
outside experts to help us learn how the intrusion occurred and to conduct
an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. It was
necessary to conduct several days of forensic analysis, and it took our
experts until [Monday] to understand the scope of the breach. We then shared
that information with our consumers and announced it publicly [Tuesday]."

Schneier said such attacks aren't unusual and that few consumers are
permanently damaged from any resulting identity theft.

"This happens a lot, and there's nothing you can do about it," Schneier
said. "You might be screwed, but you'll basically be OK."

Meanwhile, Sony said it plans to get parts of its PlayStation Network back
up "within a week."
