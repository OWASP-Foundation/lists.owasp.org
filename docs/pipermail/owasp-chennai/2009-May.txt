All,

 

In regards to CPE credits. ISC2 members can claim 1 CPE / hour of
attendance to the event. The same CPE's will not be automatically added
to your certification cycle as the same practice has been stopped by
ISC2 at all its sponsored events. This facility is only available for
Surveys /events that are conducted directly by ISC2 for its members. 

 

For any other certification body such as ISACA, you may refer to CPE
guidelines for the calculation of number of CPE's you can claim towards
event attendance.

First of all a Big thanks to Chandra for arranging this wonderful meet. Also as he rightly mentioned in his email, a BIG kudos to Priyamvadha and her team for the best hospitality.



The meeting was very useful in all the aspect. The topics under discussion were all the hot topics. One small feeling is that; we could have spent some more time with Abhay to discuss our queries. If that would have happened, the meeting would have been a grand success.



However i understand the fact that we were running short of time and also we can discuss our quries anytime in the forum. I suggest the participants to use our mailing group id to post your questions to Abhay, so that the others would have been benefited and we can also avoid duplicate questions.



Overall it was a wonderful way to begin the OWASP meeting for me.

Once again BIG thanks to Chandra and Priyamvadha for providing this wonderful opportunity.

Thank you Venkat , I really appreciate your E-mail as well as it
provides me the vital energy to schedule for upcoming Meeting even after
I was dejected  because of the  nominal amount of crowd in the meeting.


 

Abhay will be our regular speaker and next time will make sure that we
will allocate some more time for the discussion ,I should thank him
specially because he has spent his own money and came all the way from
Bangalore .   

 

 

I am also planning for a  Training on OWASP TOOLS possibly by June End.

I would like to thank the OWASP Chennai team for having arranged the
conference. It was nice to see a dynamic OWASP Chapter. I am sure OWASP
Chennai would scale and go on to host several world-class conferences. It is
a good start.

As I see, some of you have not had a chance to interact with me. I must
truly apologize for the absence towards the end. I had to leave for
Bangalore, as I had some prior engagements to keep.

I welcome any interaction from all of you. Please post your questions to me
through the community or my blog.

Also, if you want your emails to be added to my blog mail list, please let
me know.

I have put up the presentation on my blog. Anyone interested, or anyone who
missed the meet, feel free to see it and provide some feedback.

Thanks

Warm Regards
Abhay

First of all a Big thanks to Chandra for arranging this wonderful meet.
Also as he rightly mentioned in his email, a BIG kudos to Priyamvadha
and her team for the best hospitality.



The meeting was very useful in all the aspect. The topics under
discussion were all the hot topics. One small feeling is that; we could
have spent some more time with Abhay to discuss our queries. If that
would have happened, the meeting would have been a grand success.



However i understand the fact that we were running short of time and
also we can discuss our quries anytime in the forum. I suggest the
participants to use our mailing group id to post your questions to
Abhay, so that the others would have been benefited and we can also
avoid duplicate questions.



Overall it was a wonderful way to begin the OWASP meeting for me.

Once again BIG thanks to Chandra and Priyamvadha for providing this
wonderful opportunity.





Thanks & Regards

Thank you Venkat , I really appreciate your E-mail as well as it
provides me the vital energy to schedule for upcoming Meeting even after
I was dejected  because of the  nominal amount of crowd in the meeting.


 

Abhay will be our regular speaker and next time will make sure that we
will allocate some more time for the discussion ,I should thank him
specially because he has spent his own money and came all the way from
Bangalore .   

 

 

I am also planning for a  Training on OWASP TOOLS possibly by June End.

I would like to thank the OWASP Chennai team for having arranged the
conference. It was nice to see a dynamic OWASP Chapter. I am sure OWASP
Chennai would scale and go on to host several world-class conferences.
It is
a good start.

As I see, some of you have not had a chance to interact with me. I must
truly apologize for the absence towards the end. I had to leave for
Bangalore, as I had some prior engagements to keep.

I welcome any interaction from all of you. Please post your questions to
me
through the community or my blog.

Also, if you want your emails to be added to my blog mail list, please
let
me know.

I have put up the presentation on my blog. Anyone interested, or anyone
who
missed the meet, feel free to see it and provide some feedback.

Thanks

Warm Regards
Abhay

First of all a Big thanks to Chandra for arranging this wonderful meet.
Also as he rightly mentioned in his email, a BIG kudos to Priyamvadha
and her team for the best hospitality.



The meeting was very useful in all the aspect. The topics under
discussion were all the hot topics. One small feeling is that; we could
have spent some more time with Abhay to discuss our queries. If that
would have happened, the meeting would have been a grand success.



However i understand the fact that we were running short of time and
also we can discuss our quries anytime in the forum. I suggest the
participants to use our mailing group id to post your questions to
Abhay, so that the others would have been benefited and we can also
avoid duplicate questions.



Overall it was a wonderful way to begin the OWASP meeting for me.

Once again BIG thanks to Chandra and Priyamvadha for providing this
wonderful opportunity.





Thanks & Regards

Thank you Venkat , I really appreciate your E-mail as well as it
provides me the vital energy to schedule for upcoming Meeting even after
I was dejected  because of the  nominal amount of crowd in the meeting.


 

Abhay will be our regular speaker and next time will make sure that we
will allocate some more time for the discussion ,I should thank him
specially because he has spent his own money and came all the way from
Bangalore .   

 

 

I am also planning for a  Training on OWASP TOOLS possibly by June End.

Subject: [Owasp-chennai] Alert - Microsoft Security Advisory 971492 Released
Message-ID: <C1EB165136AB2B4EA08B012CB9FC9A5B035C22E4@blrx3m10.blr.amer.dell.com>

What is the purpose of this alert? 

This alert is to notify you that Microsoft has released Security
Advisory 971492 - Vulnerability in Internet Information Services (IIS)
Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - on May 18, 2009.

 

Summary

 

Microsoft is investigating new public reports of a possible
vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). An
elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the WebDAV
extension for IIS handles HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by creating a specially crafted anonymous HTTP request to
gain access to a location that typically requires authentication.

 

We are not aware of attacks that are trying to use this vulnerability or
of customer impact at this time. Microsoft is investigating the public
reports.

 

We are actively working with partners in our Microsoft Active
Protections Program (MAPP) and our Microsoft Security Response Alliance
(MSRA) program to provide information that they can use to provide
broader protections to customers.

 

Upon completion of this investigation, Microsoft will take the
appropriate action to help protect our customers. This may include
providing a security update through our monthly release process or
providing an out-of-cycle security update, depending on customer needs. 

 

Affected Software

 

*         Microsoft Internet Information Services 5.0

*         Microsoft Internet Information Services 5.1

*         Microsoft Internet Information Services 6.0

 

Mitigating Factors

 

File system ACLs are enforced. This vulnerability bypasses the IIS
configuration that specifies which authentication is allowed, but not
the file system-based ACL check that verifies whether a file is
accessible by a given user. Even if successfully exploited, the attacker
would still be limited to the permissions granted to the anonymous user
account on file system ACL level. Therefore this vulnerability cannot be
used to exceed the level of access granted to the anonymous user account
through file system ACLs. The default anonymous user account is
configured as the IUSR_<computername> account.

 

The anonymous user account is denied write access by default. In order
to successfully exploit this vulnerability with write access, the
anonymous user account would need to have write access ACLs set within
the IIS folder structure. However, by default, the IUSR_<computername>
account only has read access ACLs set. On IIS 6.0, there is an explicit
deny ACE for the default anonymous user account. Unless overridden by
the administrator, this deny ACE will be inherited by all children under
the wwwroot.

 

WebDAV is not enabled by default on IIS6.0. On Windows Server 2003
systems running IIS 6.0, WebDAV is not enabled in the default
configuration. Unless WebDAV has been enabled by an administrator on
these systems, the vulnerability is not exposed.

 

Recommendations

 

Review Microsoft Security Advisory 971492 for an overview of the issue,
details on affected components, mitigating factors, suggested actions,
frequently asked questions (FAQs), and links to additional resources. 

 

Customers who believe they are affected can contact Customer Service and
Support (CSS) in North America for help with security update issues or
viruses at no charge using the PC Safety line (866) PCSAFETY.
International customers can contact Customer Service and Support by
using any method found at
http://www.microsoft.com/protect/worldwide/default.mspx.

Hi Folks,
?
I've been trying to find out ways of performing security assessment of stand-alone windows-based client?applications. But I couldn't get any lead on that.
?
It would be of great help, if anyone in this distro has any knowledge or prior experience in that area. Please throw some light on security assessment of stand-alone client applications.

Client applicaiton is Web/ Java based or VB based ?
 
You can run commerically avaialble Vulnerability scanning tools for
Windows-OS & web based applicaitons, and try to address the listed High/
Medium vulnreabilities.
 
For Winodws OS - ISS Scanner will do
For Web based applicaiton, both commerical and free ware tool is
avaialble.
 
Also Antivirus is a must.
 
Chandra can provide much more information.

First of all, let us try and understand what type of application. By "Client
Application", do you mean Desktop Application, in which case it changes the
way you approach security assessment in the first place.

hi arun,
there are quite a few things you would have to consider when testing a thick
client application.
some of the most basic checks that you can do with your existing
understanding of web security are as below:

1) check for SQL Injection
2) look at the communication channel between the client and server, is it
encrypted
3) check for any hard-coded passwords or encryption keys or any other
sensitive information in the client-side.
4) if there is any kind of access control based on accounts try to see if
you can bypass that by directly communicating with the server.
5) check out what files and registries this client reads from/writes to and
see if they contain any sensitive information

if the application is coded in native language or its managed code calling
native code internally then buffer overflows are a possibility, so you
either end up with a source code review or fuzzing the application, if you
have the required skills.

dont get too carried away by the technology part of it...in all probability
most real life abuses of the application would be an intelligent abuse of
some seemingly naive feature.

so look at all the feature of the applications and how they work and see how
they can be abused.

this would not be a perfect approach but it would get you quite far in terms
of locking it down.

if its a very critical application and the associated paranoia is high then
get an expert to test it.

hope this helps

cheers
lava

Hey recently a client wanted to know why would anyone refer to OWASP for guidelines to securing their web apps. The question was in the context of if the app is already ISO 27002 certified etc.

I created a simple one page PDF and shared with them. Might be useful in your organisations as well.

Feedback more than welcome.

The information has been taken from various sources online and the copyright only applies to presenting them in this manner. Feel free to use them anywhere and if you do quote me great but its ok otherwise as well. It was more for the client than anything else.
