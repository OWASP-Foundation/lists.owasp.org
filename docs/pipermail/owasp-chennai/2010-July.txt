Hello All,
    I have received 28 responses so far for the meeting. We will, after all,
have the meeting then :)

A slight change in the schedule. Instead of starting the meeting at 9:00am,
we will start a little later at 9:30a.
 I shall send out the detailed programme by tomorrow (or you will have to
wait till the meetings begins :) )

Thanks & Regards,
~Venk!
