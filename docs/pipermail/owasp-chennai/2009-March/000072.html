<PRE>HP is set to announce on Monday a free tool that developers can use to
check for holes in the Flash applications they write, which can lead to
data leaks and other security problems on Web sites. 

 

HP SWFScan decompiles Flash applications and searches the code for
vulnerabilities and violations of Adobe's best security practices
guidelines, said Billy Hoffman, manager of HP's Web Security Research
Group. The tool works with all versions of Flash.

 

With the Flash Player installed on more than 98 percent of
Internet-connected computers globally, Flash applications are a popular
target for attackers. HP analyzed nearly 4,000 Web apps developed with
the Flash platform and found that 35 percent violate Adobe's security
best practices.

 

For example, encryption keys and other sensitive data have been found
inside client-side Flash code, Hoffman said.

 

Flash, traditionally used for creating animation and games, has been
increasingly used for Web 2.0 apps destined for enterprise use, for
which tighter security measures are required, he said.
