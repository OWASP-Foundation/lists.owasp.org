 Hi all,


I think president and the board members of our chapter a very busy and they
have no time for chapter meetings. We respect their sense of responsibility
towards family and career, but they can delegate the responsibilities to
some other person who can carry out day to day working of our chapter as per
protocol. The classic example come to my mind is, even when our Prime
Minister is recuperating our defense minister A.K.Antony took charge of
Republic day function and our external affairs minister Mr. Pranab Mukherjee
took charge of presenting Interim Budget, all this happen as per protocol
.if a country as big and complex like India can be run without a Prime
minister for a while then I think there is no harm in conducting regular
chapter meeting if some board members are busy or absent.

Regards,

Zuber.

Hi Zuber,

      I have been trying to get a speaker for our first meeting. I am trying to get in contact with one of them. In case I see a need to delegate, I definitely will do so. None of you need to worry about it. As already mentioned, the chapter meeting will happen around the middle of the next month. I am waiting for the speaker's time. Once that is confirmed, I will let you folks know the exact venue, date and time.

 

 

 

Thanks & Regards,

 Hi all,


I think president and the board members of our chapter a very busy and they have no time for chapter meetings. We respect their sense of responsibility towards family and career, but they can delegate the responsibilities to some other person who can carry out day to day working of our chapter as per protocol. The classic example come to my mind is, even when our Prime Minister is recuperating our defense minister A.K.Antony took charge of Republic day function and our external affairs minister Mr. Pranab Mukherjee took charge of presenting Interim Budget, all this happen as per protocol .if a country as big and complex like India can be run without a Prime minister for a while then I think there is no harm in conducting regular chapter meeting if some board members are busy or absent.




Regards, 

Zuber.
