Hi All,
    Tomorrow's program of our meeting stands cancelled due to
non-availability of meeting place. I will update you with the new date when
we can meet.
    We only had 2 speakers for the meeting. Anyone else willing to pitch in
- welcome as much. I am looking at around the 3rd or 4th week of August for
our meeting.
    As of now, Santosh and Prasanna Venkat have agreed to give
presentations. We will be requiring at least one more speaker for the
meeting.

    Apologies for the last minute shift in the schedule. Will keep you
posted on the next meeting date.

Thanks & Regards,
~Venki
