<PRE>Dear Mark,
 
In recognition of your previous support at OWASP events, the AppSec DC organizers would like to offer the first 100 people $100 off the cost of admission to OWASP AppSec DC.  Register at <A HREF="http://reg.appsecdc.org">http://reg.appsecdc.org</A> with discount code (DC12BOOMERANG). 

Now in its third year, AppSec DC is the Open Web &amp; Application Security Project's (OWASP's) premier AppSec DC conference will be held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, April 2-5.  AppSec DC features two days of training April 2-3, followed by two days of talks, April 4-5. In accordance with the broadening of OWASP's mission after the 2011 OWASP Global Summit, AppSec DC is not restricting its content to strictly to the realm of web applications. We invite all practitioners of application security and those who work with or interact with all facets of application security to submit papers and participate in the conference.  As a result AppSec DC will have a focus on Critical Infrastructure (ICS/SCADA) and Mobile application security.

Highlight's of AppSec DC 2012 will include:

*Keynote by Daniel Earl Geer, Jr., Sc.D., Creator of the Index of Cyber Security (2011) and the Cyber Security Decision Market (2011), among his numerous other accomplishments
*Presentation by Joe Jarzombek, Director for Software Assurance, National Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security
*Presentation by Ruben Santamarta of IOActive will present on backdoors in industrial control systems devices.
*Panel topics to include Critical Infrastructure, Pentesting Smart Grid Web Apps, How to Get Every IT Architect to Become a Security Ambassador, *Adapting and Managing IT Security Solutions for Industrial Control Systems
*Training classes to include Assessing and Exploiting Web Applications with Samurai-WTF, Building Secure Android Apps, Secure Web Application *Development Training
*Full schedule at <A HREF="http://schedule.appsecdc.org">http://schedule.appsecdc.org</A>

We hope to see you there!

Regards,
The AppSec DC Team
