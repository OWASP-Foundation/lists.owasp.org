Hello All,
    As already indicated by Chandru in his earlier communication regarding
CFP for the November meeting, I am urging the interested candidates to
submit their intent to present as soon as possible. It would be of immense
help to the organizers and the attendees if you can indicate the topic and
also the duration of your papers presentation to us before Saturday,
20-Nov-2010. This will also enable us to envisage the interests in the
participants and can accept the invitations accordingly.

Please note that, going forward, all participants to the OWASP Chennai
meetings will be admitted only upon registration and having a valid TICKET.

Thanks & Regards,
~Venki
