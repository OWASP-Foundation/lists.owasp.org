<PRE> Hi all,


I think president and the board members of our chapter a very busy and they
have no time for chapter meetings. We respect their sense of responsibility
towards family and career, but they can delegate the responsibilities to
some other person who can carry out day to day working of our chapter as per
protocol. The classic example come to my mind is, even when our Prime
Minister is recuperating our defense minister A.K.Antony took charge of
Republic day function and our external affairs minister Mr. Pranab Mukherjee
took charge of presenting Interim Budget, all this happen as per protocol
.if a country as big and complex like India can be run without a Prime
minister for a while then I think there is no harm in conducting regular
chapter meeting if some board members are busy or absent.

Regards,

Zuber.
