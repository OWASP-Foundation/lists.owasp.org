Dear OWASP Members,

There is no denying that cyber security has become integral part of
protecting our nation's integrity. This fact can't be highlighted more
than the venerable presence of the most respected technocrat India has
ever produced, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam (Former President of India) and Vice
Admiral Shekhar Sinha VSM, NM & BAR, Chief - Integrated Defence Staff,
Ministry of Defence who will grace the upcoming event "Securitybyte &
OWASP AppSec Asia 2009" to be held on 17th - 20th November 2009 at Hotel
Crowne Plaza, Gurgaon, Delhi NCR.

OWASP India is glad to know that our whole and sole mission has reached
the most highest echelons of government. 

You would be glad to know that as of now we have got 300+ confirmed
participation requests. The participation is in amalgamation of the best
and the brightest - civil/government servants, successful entrepreneurs,
InfoSec experts, hackers, other IT professionals and academia. 

We appreciate your enormous support and foresee similar participation
for our future events as well. We have very limited seats available and
even if you intend to register onsite then let us know today to check
the availability.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv Soi
