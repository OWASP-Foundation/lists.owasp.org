<PRE>Hi,

I have a little doubt if the mailing list is run by the community or by one
or two people. Even to approve my request to join the group, it had taken a
month. I sent a request on Jun4, and I got approved just today(Jul 10).
Please take a look at ILUGC or Owasp bangalore. Whoever is the moderator,
should enable automatic approval, if he/she cannot take the responsibility
to approve requests in a reasonable amount of time. Or if he/she would
definitely need manual approval system to avoid unwanted elements, and
cannot make sure that all requests are approved in a reasonable amount of
time, should entrust the power of approving requests to someone who is a
longtime member of the community. By the delay to approve the request, I
just get a doubt if its really community driven, or driven by the few who
started the ML. Or probably the moderator is a person who is not interested
in the topic, and just started ther mailing list out of an intermittent
interest??
