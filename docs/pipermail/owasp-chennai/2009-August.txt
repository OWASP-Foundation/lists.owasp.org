Subject: [Owasp-chennai] Network Solutions Data Breach: 573,

Company Says It Was PCI-Compliant When Hacked

July 28, 2009 - Linda McGlasson, Managing Editor


A data breach at Internet domain administrator and host Network
Solutions has compromised personal and financial data for more than
573,000 credit and debit cardholders. To add more pain to the breach,
Network Solutions says it was PCI compliant at the time of the breach. 

The breach, discovered in June
<http://about.networksolutions.com/site/data-security-alert-problem-fix-
and-customers-notified/> , was the result of hackers planting rogue code
on the company's Web servers used to host mostly small online stores,
intercepting financial transactions between the sites and their
customers. No further explanation of how the rogue code made its way
onto the company's servers was available from Network Solutions. When
asked, Susan Wade, Network Solutions communications representative says
"Not at this time. Because of the ongoing law enforcement investigation,
we aren't able to release that information." 

Compromised data was captured between March 12 and June 8, 2009, when
the breach was discovered, says Wade. 

The last PCI assessment and certification of Network Solutions' networks
was completed on October 31, 2008, says Wade. The firm that performed
the assessment was the Payment Software Company, a San Jose, CA-based
qualified security assessor company. 

The 4.343 ecommerce merchant customers were notified of the breach on
Friday, July 24, via an email and a letter sent via US postal service,
Wade says. Network Solutions provides service to more than 10,000
merchant websites. The ecommerce customers are mainly small businesses,
mostly "Mom and Pop" type retailers spread geographically across the
country. Wade says that Network Solutions has offered them help in
contacting their affected customers. Of the compromised data, no fraud
has been reported thus far by the four major credit card brands, Wade
notes. 

Network Solutions has hired TransUnion, a credit reporting agency, to
work with it on behalf of its merchants, to contact their customers
whose data may have been affected. Affected merchants can visit
www.careandprotect.com, the website Network Solutions set up for them to
get more information. 

PCI Security Council Weighs In 

Just because a company has passed its compliance validation, it doesn't
mean that the need for vigilance of security measures should stop, says
PCI Security Standards Council General Manager Bob Russo. As for whether
Network Solutions was PCI-compliant at the time of the breach, Russo
notes, "Until a forensics investigation is completed, an organization
can not comment accurately on its compliance status." 

The announcement a data breach at Network Solutions underscores the
necessity for ongoing vigilance of an organization's security measures,
he adds. "Security doesn't stop with PCI compliance validation. As the
Council has said many times, it is not enough to validate compliance
annually and not adopt security into an organization's ongoing business
practices," Russo states. A card data environment is under constant
threat, so businesses must ensure their safeguards are also under
constant vigilance - "monitoring and where necessary, ongoing
improvement. A layered approach to security is absolutely necessary to
protect sensitive payment card data - without ongoing vigilance or a
comprehensive security strategy, organizations may be just a change
control away from noncompliance," he says. 

Validation to the principles and practices mandated in the PCI DSS plays
an integral part in an organization's security posture, but basic
monitoring and logging cannot be set aside after a security assessment
is complete, Russo stresses. "Reports by forensics companies suggest
that this is an area of weakness among organizations," he says. "An
intrusion need not result in card data compromise if an organization is
following the 12 guiding requirements of the PCI Data Security
Standard."

Hi Chennai OWASPers,
    The scheduled chapter meeting to be held on 15-Aug-2009 stands cancelled
because of too few participants and lack of papers submission from the
chapter members. We will let you now when we can have the next chapter
meeting.

Thanks & Regards,
