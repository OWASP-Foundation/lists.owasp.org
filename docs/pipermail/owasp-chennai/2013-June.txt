Subject: [Owasp-chennai] CFP Extended, Do it now!
Message-ID: <CA+Rr0=6cek_PW7mSobXq8uwPSrvhhfk5uHqicpzRqf+BShwBkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Good News for information security experts who couldn't yet submit their
papers for "OWASP InfoSec India Conference 2013" happening at Hotel Crowne
Plaza, Gurgaon, New Delhi NCR, India from August 30-31, 2013.

With few great papers submitted already, we would like to take this
opportunity to extend the CFP submission dates to 10 more days in order to
allow maximum participation.

CFP is now closing on June 25th, 2013, more details can be found at:
http://2013.owasp.in/category/cfp/

Don't miss out the opportunity to present your paper to a vibrant
information security community of CIOs, CISOs, investigators, policy
makers, INTs, defense, CERTs in the cyber city and national capital region
of India.

Many Thanks,
Dhruv Soi
Chair - OWASP India
