Subject: [Owasp-chennai] Suggestion for a good Web security scanner
Message-ID: <AANLkTimHS-ef3iprhd8AJQmSWB-Cce-5kgQTj2TqDSM=@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Fellow OWASPers,

I've been trying to evaluate tools that would help me find XSS and other
security loopholes on a given site.

Scanmus is one that is not available to anyone outside of Yahoo!
Acunetix is another that I found.
Burpsuite Professional doesn't let users trial the software before buying
it.
It is difficult to evaluate these software without getting hold of a copy.

Any suggestions or pointers from your experiences would be highly
appreciated

PS: Excuse me about cross posting to bangalore and chennai lists, incase
there are people subscribed to both.

Thanks,
Rajagopal

Try HP WebInspect, IBM AppScan and Cenzic. I hope you are trying to
test a non RIA web application.

Thanks Bharane
Yes, I'm testing a non-RIA app.

In my opinion

1. IBM Appscan  and Burpsuite Professional (through Manual exploit)

2. Cenzic

3. Netsparker

4. Webinspect

Dear all

Pls find below Detailed Web APplication Attacks in Tools Perspective

*Scan Type & Target *

*Reflected XSS*

*SQL Injection (MySQL)*

*Initial Public Scan*

Initial Scan on the Application?s Public (unauthenticated) Section

(*Purpose:* *gather as many ?Low Hanging Fruit? exposures as possible with a
minimal amount of false positives*)

*Netsparker* AND *Acunetix* AND *N-Stalker* AND *SkipFish*

(Nearly False Positive Free Combination)

*ProxyStrike *AND *WebCruiser*

(Nearly False Positive Free Combination)

*Internal Scan - Unsafe*

The Application?s Internal (authenticated) Section

  *Netsparker* AND *Acunetix* AND *SkipFish*

(Nearly False Positive Free Combination)

*Wapiti*

(Verification with other tools is recommended to reduce False
Positives ? *ProxyStrike
*AND *WebCruiser, *In addition to one of the following: W3AF/Andipaors/ZAP/

Netsparker/Sandcat/

Oedipus)

* *

*Internal Scan - Safe*

The Application?s Internal (authenticated) Section

(*Method: scan internal application pages without activating any delete,
logout or other dangerous operations*).

*ZAP* AND *W3AF*

(Safe combination with relatively efficient accuracy)

*W3AF *AND *Andiparos*/*Paros* AND* Oedipus *AND* ProxyStrike*

   *Additional Public Scan*

Detect additional potential exposures that require manual verification, and
aren?t covered by previous tools

(Public Section)

*ProxyStrike* OR *Sandcat (Grabber *detects 1-2 additional POST cases -
optional*)*

*Wapiti*

*2nd Internal ? Unsafe*

Detect additional potential exposures that require manual verification, and
aren?t covered by previous tools

  *ProxyStrike* OR *Sandcat*

*Wapiti*

(No substantial change, so there?s no need to run another scan)

*2nd Internal ? Safe*

Detect additional potential exposures that require manual verification, and
aren?t covered by previous tools

(*Method: scan internal application pages for additional exposure instances
without activating any delete, logout or other dangerous operations*)

*ProxyStrike*

*W3AF *AND *Andiparos*/*Paros* AND* Oedipus *AND* ProxyStrike*

(No substantial change, so there?s no need to run another scan)

*Complementary Scan for Additional Exposures*

*Complementary Scan*

Scan the applications with scanners that have a wider range of features, to
cover additional security flaws

*W3AF* AND/OR *Arachni* AND/OR *Skipfish* AND/OR *Sandcat*

Srini,

That's a real good list. Thank you for posting it.
I feel that tools only help provide a good technical baseline. For a
detailed perspective, the specialist needs to analyze the business processes
(technical/functional) and identify the vulnerabilities in them. Only then
will an application be considered secure.

Warmest Regards
Bharane
