Hi Team,
    We are planning to have a meeting of OWASP Chennai on August 2nd 2014.
Inviting speakers to give sessions on security topic for at least 30
minutes. We are looking for about 2-3 presentations.

    The topics must be generic security specifics. Please, do not talk
about your company products. Any speaker for OWASP projects are welcome!

    Kindly help by ensuring we have enough speakers to continue running our
Chapter!

Thanks & Regards,
~Venki
OWASP Chennai Chapter Leader
