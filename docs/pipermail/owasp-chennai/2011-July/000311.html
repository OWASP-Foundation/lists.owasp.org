<PRE>Hello,

OWASP has recently announced a new membership model.  Now you might be able
to pay a discounted membership while enjoying the full benefits of a OWASP
member.  For example, the regular  annual membership fee is $50, but people
from some developing countries pay only $20.  To find out how to take
advantage of this discount, just send an email to your chapter leader or
reply to this email.

Benefits of OWASP members include professional association, voting rights
for OWASP elections, as well as discounted attendance at OWASP conferences.
For example, if you are a member, then there is no charge to attend AppSec
Asia 2011 in Beijing, China from November 8 to
11&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Global_AppSec_Asia_2011">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Global_AppSec_Asia_2011</A>&gt;
.

OWASP is a worldwide not-for-profit organization.  For the last ten years,
it provides free, open and unbiased application security materials to the
public.  Your donation supports your local chapter and other operational
costs.  To become a proud member today, please go to *
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership#Please_Join_Us*">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership#Please_Join_Us*</A> and then click on
the Donate Now button in the* Individual Supporters* table.
