*Hacker shows off remote ATM exploit*

Posted Sun Aug 1, 2010 10:06am AEST

A computer hacker has demonstrated a technique to remotely make an ATM spit
out cash using the internet.

New Zealand researcher Barnaby Jack publicly showed off the "ATM
jackpotting" technique at the DefCon hackers conference in Las Vagas, in the
United States.

Mr Jack proved his findings using two kinds of ATMs typically found in
corner stores, bars or other "stand-alone" venues in the US, but said the
flaw likely exists in machines at well-known banks.

"You don't have to go to the ATM at all," Mr Jack said.

"You can do it from the comfort of your own bedroom."

Mr Jack says banks use remote management software to monitor and control
their ATMs.

He says he used a weakness in that software to take control of machines over
the internet.

He says his method bypasses the need to submit passwords and serial numbers
to access ATMs remotely.

Once in the machines, he says he can command them to spit out cash or
transfer funds.

He says he could also capture account data from magnetic strips on credit or
bank cards as well as passwords punched in by ATM users.

"When you think about ATM security you generally think about the hardware
side; is it bolted down and are the cameras in position," Mr Jack said.

"This is the first time anyone has taken the approach of trying to attack
the underlying software.

"It is time to find software defences rather than hardware defences."

Mr Jack did not reveal specifics of the attack to hackers at the conference,
but did tell ATM makers about the flaw so they could bolster machine
defences.

"I might get my butt in hot water if I released the code," he said.

"I was careful not to release the keys to the kingdom."

Mr Jack says he has grown wary of ATMs since discovering the remote exploit.

"I just keep my cash under the bed now," he said.

Hello All,

First of all thanks for OWASP chennai for organizing such a great meetup.

All the three speakers are very crisp with their points and shared their
personal experiences related to their talks. They are highly informative and
I learned a lot from those sessions.

I too feel, our next meet should have some live workshop or demos.

Cheers

Subject: [Owasp-chennai] Home ministry PCs hit by virus
Message-ID: <AANLkTikgocKv+dxa=MMqJZg-bnJm+aJL0JhNQURRrdY5@mail.gmail.com>

 NEW DELHI: Unknown hackers hacked the internet account of the Indian
ambassador to Uzbekistan and sent virus-attached emails to some officials of
the home ministry, sending the security establishment in a tizzy.

 The "malicious" email contains a dangerous malware, Trojan, which allows
the hacker remote access to the user's computer system, according to
sources.
 Investigators suspect that hackers in a "foreign" country have cracked the
email ID of the ambassador and used his account to send the virus.

 The Intelligence Bureau (IB), according to officials, has warned home
ministry officials against opening such email that asks a user to run or
install an unknown programme making the computer accessible to hackers.

 "The Intelligence Bureau has intimated that a number of senior officers in
the ministry have received a malicious mail from the email ID containing a
Trojan concealed inside a sham list of some Indian terrorists," said a
source, quoting an IB circular.

 The virus -- used for data theft, downloading or uploading of files on the
user's computer and even keystroke logging -- has attacked the computers
even as the government's IT arm National Informatics Centre (NIC) had
installed one of the latest antivirus softwares in the official computers.

 The officials maintained that there was no sensitive information stored in
the computers attacked but still the IB has ordered certain procedures to
minimize the damage.
 They have advised that all computers in the North Block should be regularly
updated with latest antivirus software applications. Besides, no sensitive
document should be stored in computers connected to the internet.

 "There is proper control over the use of computer storage media (CSM)," the
circular says, adding if a pen drive is used in standalone and internet
computers, "all precautions should be taken to ensure that the drive is
treated (scanned) with antivirus software and there is no hidden folder.?
