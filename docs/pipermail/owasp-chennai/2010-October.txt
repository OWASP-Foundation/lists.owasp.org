All

As some of you might know, PCI-DSS v 2.0 has just been released 2 days ago.
It has certain changes that might influence your environments or your PCI
implementations. I have written the first of my two part blogpost on the
analysis of PCI v 2.0. Its on my blog: citadelnotes.blogspot.com

Hope you find it useful. Please write to me if you have any questions

Regards
Abhay
