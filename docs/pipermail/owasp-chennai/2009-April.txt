Hi Friends,

I just wonder, do we have any standard methodology to identify false positive among the vulnerabilities reported by a tool?

Can anyone share your experience or thought on this?

Hi,

I am interested in attending the 2nd meeting as i was unfortunate to miss the 1st meet due to my travel.

It would be great if you could inform the date little advance and so I can reschedule my travel if any.

Thanks for your initiative.

Venkat K
