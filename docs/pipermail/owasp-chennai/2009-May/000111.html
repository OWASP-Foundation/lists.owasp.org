<PRE>What is the purpose of this alert? 

This alert is to notify you that Microsoft has released Security
Advisory 971492 - Vulnerability in Internet Information Services (IIS)
Could Allow Elevation of Privilege - on May 18, 2009.

 

Summary

 

Microsoft is investigating new public reports of a possible
vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). An
elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the WebDAV
extension for IIS handles HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by creating a specially crafted anonymous HTTP request to
gain access to a location that typically requires authentication.

 

We are not aware of attacks that are trying to use this vulnerability or
of customer impact at this time. Microsoft is investigating the public
reports.

 

We are actively working with partners in our Microsoft Active
Protections Program (MAPP) and our Microsoft Security Response Alliance
(MSRA) program to provide information that they can use to provide
broader protections to customers.

 

Upon completion of this investigation, Microsoft will take the
appropriate action to help protect our customers. This may include
providing a security update through our monthly release process or
providing an out-of-cycle security update, depending on customer needs. 

 

Affected Software

 

*         Microsoft Internet Information Services 5.0

*         Microsoft Internet Information Services 5.1

*         Microsoft Internet Information Services 6.0

 

Mitigating Factors

 

File system ACLs are enforced. This vulnerability bypasses the IIS
configuration that specifies which authentication is allowed, but not
the file system-based ACL check that verifies whether a file is
accessible by a given user. Even if successfully exploited, the attacker
would still be limited to the permissions granted to the anonymous user
account on file system ACL level. Therefore this vulnerability cannot be
used to exceed the level of access granted to the anonymous user account
through file system ACLs. The default anonymous user account is
configured as the IUSR_&lt;computername&gt; account.

 

The anonymous user account is denied write access by default. In order
to successfully exploit this vulnerability with write access, the
anonymous user account would need to have write access ACLs set within
the IIS folder structure. However, by default, the IUSR_&lt;computername&gt;
account only has read access ACLs set. On IIS 6.0, there is an explicit
deny ACE for the default anonymous user account. Unless overridden by
the administrator, this deny ACE will be inherited by all children under
the wwwroot.

 

WebDAV is not enabled by default on IIS6.0. On Windows Server 2003
systems running IIS 6.0, WebDAV is not enabled in the default
configuration. Unless WebDAV has been enabled by an administrator on
these systems, the vulnerability is not exposed.
