Dear All,

I found this interesting news about ATM Malware. Interesting :) ...........




ATM Malware Spreading Around the World


Cash machines around the world are hosting malware that can harvest a person's card details for use in fraud, a situation that could worsen as the malware becomes more sophisticated, according to a security researcher.


By Jeremy Kirk 

 

Fri, June 05, 2009 - IDG News Service - Cash machines around the world are hosting malware that can harvest a person's card details for use in fraud, a situation that could worsen as the malware becomes more sophisticated, according to a security researcher. Analysts at Trustwave's SpiderLabs research group were surprised earlier this year when it obtained the ATM malware sample <https://www.trustwave.com/downloads/alerts/Trustwave-Security-Alert-ATM-Malware-Analysis-Briefing.pdf>  from a financial institution in Eastern Europe, said Andrew Henwood, vice president of SpiderLabs's Europe, Middle East and Africa operation. Trustwave does forensic investigations for major credit card companies and financial institutions as well as penetration tests.
"It's the first time we have come across malware of this type," Henwood said.
The malware records the magnetic stripe information on the back of a card as well as the PIN (personal identification number). That data can be printed out on the ATM's receipt roll when a special master card is inserted to the ATM that launches a user interface. It can also be recorded on the magnetic stripe of that master control card.
"We were surprised at the level of sophistication," Henwood said. "It does make us generally pretty nervous."
Most ATMs run security software, but financial institutions haven't focused on their security as much as other systems, Henwood said.
"ATMs were kind of an afterthought and were considered to be fairly stable," Henwood said. "I'd say there's not been enough focus in the past on ATM infrastructure."
Those who wrote the malware have detailed knowledge about how ATMs work, Henwood said. The sample they tested ran on ATMs using Microsoft's Windows XP operating system.
The sample did not have networking capabilities, but that may be a natural evolution. That's particularly dangerous since most ATM machines in developed countries are networked. The danger is that the malware could be engineered into a worm that, once on one ATM, spreads through all ATMs on a network, Henwood said.
To install the malware, a person would need access to inside of the ATM or a port in which software could be uploaded. That means insiders could be involved, or cybercriminals have picked a lock on an ATM in order to install the software, Henwood said.
SpiderLabs has received information that similar malware has been found on ATMs now outside of Eastern Europe, Henwood said. Since then, the lab has provided detailed information on the malware to financial institutions and law enforcement, he said.
In March, security vendor Sophos found it had captured three ATM malware samples <http://www.sophos.com/blogs/sophoslabs/v/post/3577>  customized to target machines made by Diebold, around the same time SpiderLabs saw its first sample.

Amar Wakharkar.

This looks like a fairly complex infection mechanism combining
exploiting websites, injecting JavaScript code then attempted
exploitation of host machines and failing that prompting a download for
some fake malware.

The way they have it all setup is pretty clever too hiding behind common
technologies so their infections don't look out of place.

This is the same Gumblar worm, I have been blogging about. You can also read
my real-world experience with this worm on my blog.

P.S. This is quite a serious worm. Last week this worm had a world-wide
footprint of 3000 systems, now it has risen 10 times.

Shanmuga

One of your points is alright. FTP Credentials will have to be changed now,
with this worm out in the wild. Default settings on FTP can be compromised
anyway, worm or no worm. The worm does not try and bruteforce your FTP
credentials. It merely gleans the passwords and reports it to the bot herder

Unfortunately this worm does not stop at FTP credentials. It even disables
AV and patching and goes a step further to install its own bogus AV
solution. Keep an eye out for any bogus AV apps you may find in your
network. This is a hard worm to detect because of its obfuscated nature.

With reference to your point on the Chinese IPs, there were several more IPs
that were found distributing the worm (in different countries) like Russia,
etc. Censorship of the IP/IP range is not a solution. These worms are
largely driven from proxy sites and fake dynamic dns', which can be created
for free. These worms have a distributed set of botnets working in tandem.

I would pay more attention Traffic analysis, AV Signatures, Patching, IPS
sigs and browser security. Enterprise browser security is in the middle ages
even today. Even today, we have IE6, which are being driven from Active
Directories. Yesterday, while on assessment, we discovered some affected
systems that were sending out a boatload of syns to some random IPs on the
internet.

There are some ways to protect oneself from malicious links in websites
(especially social networking sites). These are addons to Mozilla which can
be used to preview links or understand more about them before actually
clicking on the link. These are LinkAlert and CoolPreviews.  Link Alert is a
neat little widget which provides info about the site which is behind the
click, like whether it is a JS being accessed, or a regular site or a secure
site. It provides info about things like a new window opening up.
CoolPreviews is also very useful as it provides the preview of the site,
before you can click on it. I use both of these in tandem, and I am quite
sure using these 2 effectively in your daily browsing activities can
prevent, to a large extent, a phishing issue, or an XSS issue, or a
clickjacking issue also.

Hi,

The problem is with FTP Information of websites.

Since FTP allows unlimited login attempts they get  hacked easily.

If you have any  Default FTP accounts,Delete it and create new FTP accounts.

a)FTP accounts should not have default usernames and make passwords complex.

Since most of code  malware injected points to Chinese sites,Block ip's from
China in .htaccess file

This is the same Gumblar worm, I have been blogging about. You can also
read my real-world experience with this worm on my blog. 

P.S. This is quite a serious worm. Last week this worm had a world-wide
footprint of 3000 systems, now it has risen 10 times.

Please do count me in this time aswell !! :)  also i would love to add a
small suggestion here,
it would be great if we had a medium/forum where we can communicate to the
members in the group.
as getting in touch with the group members via email threads that keep
getting longger with many
repeatitions, doesnt make much of a sense. if we have a wiki or a vbulletin
or other such place to
post public opinions and easier to reach other members will b of a great
use.
please advice. keep up the good work, thanks again.

Its on the similar lines of the Gumblar or any other redirection worm, the
only difference being that it opens out to an Iframe. But I find this to be
a more advanced vector as compared to the Gumblar, but there is little
information about how it infects a site. Advice: Patch your Adobe readers.
Javascript is out in the wild!!

Hi Vinod,
    Sure you are in!
    Regarding your suggestion, we are in the process of creating a seperate
website for owasp-chennai that will cater to the request that you have
indicated. I have already booked the site and wwe are in a process of
contentizing that.

Some random thoughts on that are listed below:

0. Puzzles & Games
1. Articles
2. Links
3. Calendar - for events and meetings
4. Uploads of ppt that were used in the chapter meetings
5. Pools & opinions
6. Forum for question & answers

Am also open to continue this discussion further and improve it.

Thanks & Regards,
~Venki

Message-ID: <c86ca9490906190006x677ab41kb385d13969766726@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi Chennai OWASPers,
    As already indicated by Chandru, we are planning for a OWASP Chennai
meet in the month of July, preferably around the 2nd or the third week. If
you are intrested in doing a presentation, please let me & Chandra know. It
would be great if you can give us the topic in advance. Typical duration
would be around 30 to 45 minutes. We would like to know this before the
first week of July as it would help us choose the appropriate topics and als
schedule the others for the subsequent meetings.

    I would also like to know if any of your companies would be intrested in
sponsoring the next meeting. Kindly get in touch with me if you company is
willing to sponsor the next event.

Thanks & Regards,
~Venki

Hi Vinod,

    Sure you are in! 

    Regarding your suggestion, we are in the process of creating a
seperate website for owasp-chennai that will cater to the request that
you have indicated. I have already booked the site and wwe are in a
process of contentizing that.

 

Some random thoughts on that are listed below:

 

0. Puzzles & Games

1. Articles

2. Links

3. Calendar - for events and meetings

4. Uploads of ppt that were used in the chapter meetings

5. Pools & opinions

6. Forum for question & answers

 

Am also open to continue this discussion further and improve it.

 

Thanks & Regards,

~Venki

Please do count me in this time aswell !! :)  also i would love to add a
small suggestion here,
it would be great if we had a medium/forum where we can communicate to
the members in the group.
as getting in touch with the group members via email threads that keep
getting longger with many 
repeatitions, doesnt make much of a sense. if we have a wiki or a
vbulletin or other such place to 
post public opinions and easier to reach other members will b of a great
use.
please advice. keep up the good work, thanks again.

Subject: [Owasp-chennai] Now Topic For tne next owasp-chennai meet

Hi Chennai OWASPers,

    As already indicated by Chandru, we are planning for a OWASP Chennai
meet in the month of July, preferably around the 2nd or the third week.
If you are intrested in doing a presentation, please let me & Chandra
know. It would be great if you can give us the topic in advance. Typical
duration would be around 30 to 45 minutes. We would like to know this
before the first week of July as it would help us choose the appropriate
topics and als schedule the others for the subsequent meetings.

 

    I would also like to know if any of your companies would be
intrested in sponsoring the next meeting. Kindly get in touch with me if
you company is willing to sponsor the next event.

 

Thanks & Regards,

~Venki
