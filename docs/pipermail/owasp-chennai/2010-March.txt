Typical Web Firewalls use a mechanism to classify anomaly traffics. This
tool submits an old-school malicious (not dangerous) request, and tells
you the type of firewall a particular web site use (if any). Mainly
useful for black box security assessment.

Hi

Am organizing a regular meeting venue for OWASP and would like to know if
this will be a good thing to do. It will be great if regular meetings /
trainings can be scheduled and members can interact.

Shall appreciate feedback from members.
