I am surprised to see this email coming up on the OWASP mail list.

The people behind this campaign have setup an online petition. Once you sign
the petition, you are redirected to a page similar to this -
http://greenpeace.in/safefood/chavan-petition/thank-you/.

Here, they ask you for your email *and password*, so that they can read your
address book and send an email to all your contacts. That's how this email
spreads like wild fire.

I can't understand how people hand over their passwords to random websites
on the internet. But worse, people registered to owasp mailing list are also
falling to such schemes. Really sad.
