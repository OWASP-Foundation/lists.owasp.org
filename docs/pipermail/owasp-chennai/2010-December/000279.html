<PRE>Hello OWASP Chennai members
     Greetings folks.

     We wanted to conduct the last meeting of our chapter for this year on
18th December. But unfortunately we could not because of lack of speakers
for the meeting. Nevertheless, we are still making arrangements for the
speakers and the next meeting date is scheduled to be held on Saturday, 8th
January 2011.

     As already indicated, the call for speakers is still on.


    Often times, i receive mails from the members requesting for conducting
the meeting. But apparently, when a call for speakers is done, no one
responds. Thats a bt ironic as without the volunteers, these meetings can
hardly happen. I would kindly request more participation from each one of
you in this esteemed list. Your participation can be in any of the following
form:

0. As a speaker
1. You can also pass on any iother industry specailist contact details.
Either myself or Chandra can talk to them and get their time for the meeting
2. A volunterr for arranging a place for the meeting
3. Any other form as you can volunterr to help.

    This event stands cancelled primarily because of non-availability of
speakres and also due to non availability of a meeting space. :(. It was
indeed unfortunate that the last meeting of this year could not happen
successfuly.

    But, we are not going to be bogged down by this one meeting that got
cancelled. The following year, we will be start our first meeting on the 8th
of January and make sure that we will all meet regularly as we used to do
this year. We had made it a practice to meet every 2 months and we were able
to do that properly in the latter half of this year.

    Going forward, I would urge each one of you to volunteer as a speaker
and take this forward, because as a community we can survice if we are able
to share the knowledge.

    Also, please feel free to contribute towards our chapter. Any amount is
welcome and it can be as low as US$ 10 (&lt; INR 500). This will be used for
the snacks etc that we supply for the meetings. Although I did not want to
mention this, for all the meetings so far, I had personally paid from my
pocket. In a couple of instances, Chandru also paid for conducting the
meeting from his own pocket. And each meeting costs us around INR 500 to INR
800, depending on the location and the cost fo the snacks (tea + samosa/puff
etc). I know this is not much of an amount but considering the frequency of
such meetings going forward, we would like to have enough contributions from
one and all amd make this chapter the best so far.

Thanks &amp; Regards,
~Venki
OWASP Chennai Chapter Lead
