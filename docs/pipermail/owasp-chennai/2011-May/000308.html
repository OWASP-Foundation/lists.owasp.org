When a group of investors offered to pay

years ago, the technology veterans were derided for buying a fallen
Internet darling hobbled by losses and lawsuits.

After agreeing to sell the company for $8.5 billion to
Microsoft&lt;<A HREF="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=MSFT&amp;inline=nyt-org">http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=MSFT&amp;inline=nyt-org</A>&gt;,

a venture

and a pension fund &#8212; are now poised to reap a windfall. Even eBay,
which took a $1.4 billion hit on its original investment, looks to collect
more than $2 billion on Skype.

With the Microsoft deal, which was announced on Tuesday, Skype avoids
becoming a technology clich&#233;. Many Internet stars attract lofty bids from
deep-pocketed suitors, only to fade a few years later. But few make a splash
for a second time.

&#8220;It was an orphaned division of eBay,&#8221; said Egon Durban, a managing director
at Silver Lake Partners, one of the investors in Skype. &#8220;But we thought we
could take Skype, a great Internet brand, and turn it into an ubiquitous
communications platform.&#8221;

Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis,
Skype quickly became an online sensation. Within the first two months of its
start, more than a billion people had downloaded the communications service.

Less than two years later, eBay, the huge online marketplace, rushed to
capitalize on Skype&#8217;s popularity, offering $2.6 billion for the company,
with an additional $1.5 billion in performance-based incentives. The young
founders eagerly accepted.

But the marriage soon soured. While the auction site thought Skype&#8217;s
video-and-voice platform would enhance the user experience, it was an
awkward fit. A series of management shuffles only added to the tension
between eBay management and Skype&#8217;s founders.

Although the number of Skype subscribers continued to grow under eBay&#8217;s
watch, losses swelled. In 2007, eBay took a $1.4 billion write-down on the
business, watching it continue to languish. From 2006 to 2009, Skype posted
only one year of profitability.

&#8220;EBay had reasons to buy the business but they never were able to execute,&#8221;
said Benedict Evans, an analyst with the London-based research firm Enders
Analysis. &#8220;They bought the business and, it seems, they just forgot they
bought it.&#8221;

Amid the recession in 2009, Mr. Durban of Silver Lake Partners called the
venture capitalist Marc
Andreessen&lt;<A HREF="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/a/marc_andreessen/index.html?inline=nyt-per">http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/a/marc_andreessen/index.html?inline=nyt-per</A>&gt;,
the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and the venture capital firm Index
Ventures, to discuss a possible co-investment in Skype. By the end of the
year, the group had hashed out an agreement with eBay to buy a majority of
Skype for $1.9 billion.

It was a risky bet. Besides a string of losses and a weak economy, Skype was
also wrestling with intellectual property lawsuits filed by its founders.
After the acrimonious split, the founders had retained crucial patents that
formed the foundation of Skype&#8217;s platform.

Even so, the investors remained confident. Price was a big factor. The deal
valued Skype at $2.75 billion, slightly less than eBay paid four years
earlier. Silver Lake alone paid nearly a billion dollars for its stake &#8212;its
biggest single investment ever.

&#8220;Skype was embroiled in a lawsuit the day we signed and the investors were
sued the following day after signing,&#8221; Mr. Durban said. But &#8220;we saw an
unbelievable potential to transform this company.&#8221;

&#8220;There was a lot of risk,&#8221; said Mark Wiseman, the executive vice president
of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. &#8220;But we did our own due
diligence, and we saw a lot of the same things that Microsoft saw &#8212; a
dominant global brand, with a very solid, growing base of users, and a
robust technology platform.&#8221;

The investors and eBay settled the outstanding suits in late 2009. As part
of the agreement, Skype acquired the intellectual property and a holding
company owned by the founders received a 14 percent stake. Index Ventures
also bowed out of the deal.

With their legal issues behind them, Silver Lake and the other investors
swiftly moved to spruce up Skype. Over the last two years, they have pushed
the Internet company to increase its focus on development, shortened product
cycles and forged new partnerships. Skype also moved to build out its
services in the mobile and the enterprise space, both considered high-growth
markets. Last year, for instance, the company started an application for
Google&lt;<A HREF="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=GOOG&amp;inline=nyt-org">http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=GOOG&amp;inline=nyt-org</A>&gt;&#8217;s
Android mobile phones and signed a deal with Facebook.

Since 2009, Skype&#8217;s staff has increased by more than 40 percent, to about
1,000 employees. Last October, the investors hired a new chief executive,
Tony Bates, a veteran of Cisco
Systems&lt;<A HREF="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=CSCO&amp;inline=nyt-org">http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=CSCO&amp;inline=nyt-org</A>&gt;
.

&#8220;They invested a lot in making money and the quality of the service,&#8221; said
Ted Schadler, an analyst with Forrester
Research&lt;<A HREF="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=FORR&amp;inline=nyt-org">http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=FORR&amp;inline=nyt-org</A>&gt;.
&#8220;The move to hire Tony, a world-class I.T. executive, was a turning point &#8212;
that move alone said they were growing up very rapidly.&#8221;

The changes started to materialize in the numbers last year. Skype recorded
$859.8 million in revenue and a net loss of $7 million in 2010, according to
a recent filing. The previous year, the loss exceeded $300 million. Skype&#8217;s
monthly users topped 170 million, nearly double the amount at the end of
2009.

Skype&#8217;s improving fortunes started to attract the attention of potential
suitors. Technology giants like Google and Facebook were actively looking at
the company earlier this year, according to people who were close to the
matter but not authorized to speak publicly. The casual talks put a deal in
the $4 billion to $5 billion range.

Speculation of a sale spurred Microsoft into action. Steven A.
Ballmer&lt;<A HREF="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/steven_a_ballmer/index.html?inline=nyt-per">http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/steven_a_ballmer/index.html?inline=nyt-per</A>&gt;,
Microsoft&#8217;s chief executive, who said that he had considered buying Skype in
recent years, sent his chief financial officer, Peter W. Klein, to Silver
Lake&#8217;s Silicon Valley offices to make an unsolicited offer. For several
weeks, the various parties discussed the potential terms, talking about
valuation, Skype&#8217;s long-term outlook and the role of the current management
team.

In mid-April, Microsoft settled on the price, agreeing to pay $8.5 billion,
including the assumption of $725 million in debt. The deal was signed Monday
night at 9:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time.

While some worried that Microsoft paid too much, Skype&#8217;s investors stand to
profit immensely. Silver Lake Partners netted nearly $3 billion in the deal,
according to people close to the firm who were not authorized to talk
publicly. Andreessen Horowitz, which initially invested $50 million, now has
a stake valued at an estimated $200 million. The investment owned by the
founders&#8217; holding company is worth around $1.1 billion.

Mr. Durban, who says he felt a pang of seller&#8217;s remorse, was ultimately
happy with both the price and the buyer. It was, as he said, &#8220;an opportunity
to get liquidity in full.&#8221;

&#8220;It was very difficult for us to walk away.&#8221;
