Microsoft is close to buying VoIP service Skype for about $8.5bn.

An announcement could come as soon as today according to sources collared by
the Wall Street
Journal.&lt;<A HREF="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703730804576313932659388852.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703730804576313932659388852.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories</A>&gt;But
the paper cautioned that the deal was not final and may still fall
through.

The deal would be Microsoft's biggest ever, costing in the region of $8.5bn
including debts. Not that Microsoft is short of cash &#8211; it made $5.2bn in
profits last quarter and has more than $50bn in the bank or in short-term
investments.

Presumably the deal is seen as a way to bolster Microsoft's lacklustre
online and mobile businesses. Despite massive marketing spending, Bing is
still struggling to find a place in people's hearts, and Windows Mobile also
finds itself in third place.

Skype claims 23m concurrent users at busiest times and 124m people a month
using the service in some form: how many pay for the privilege is less
clear. However the company's costs are low as most of the resources -
bandwidth, processing power - used to handle calls are provided by users (or
the networks they are on) rather than by Skype itself.

Despite, or perhaps because of, its cunning parasitic P2P architecture,
Skype has been the unloved ginger step child of the internet. eBay was
forced to write off billions of dollars after buying the service and failing
to find any way to integrate it with its core auction business.

The online tat bazaar paid
$3bn&lt;<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/12/ebay_bids_skype/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/12/ebay_bids_skype/</A>&gt;for
Skype before offloading
it to Silver Lake Partners and other private investors for
$1.9bn&lt;<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/20/ebay_skype_closed/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/20/ebay_skype_closed/</A>&gt;

That transaction also settled a patent dispute
between&lt;<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/20/skype_founders_ruling/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/20/skype_founders_ruling/</A>&gt;company
founders Niklas Zennstr&#246;m and Janus Friis and eBay.

Most recently, rumours were that Google or Facebook could be
interested&lt;<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/05/skype_google_facebook_rumour/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/05/skype_google_facebook_rumour/</A>&gt;&#8211;
here's Matt
Asay's explanation&lt;<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/06/who_should_buy_skype/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/06/who_should_buy_skype/</A>&gt;of
why they should walk away, which is well worth a read.

A Microsoft spokeswoman told us: &quot;Microsoft does not comment on rumour or
speculation.&quot; &#174;
