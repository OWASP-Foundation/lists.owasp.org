Hello Everyone !

 My name is Sudarshan Pisupati. I obtained a Master's Degree in Information
Security from Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore. MD) and recently moved to
Houston.

I have a keen interest in  Application security and I look forward to
getting involved in the Houston chapter of OWASP.

I was also fortunate to attend the OWASP app-sec conference in Washington DC
in Nov 2009. It was not only the best learning experience of my life , but
also one of the best conferences I have attended till date !

I wish to be involved in supporting the local chapter in any way I can.

I look forward to meeting with all of you .

Regards,
Sudarshan Pisupati
