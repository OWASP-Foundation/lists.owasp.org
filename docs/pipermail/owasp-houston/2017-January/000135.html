<PRE>Happy New Year!

We will be hosting a New Year kick-off event to get the year started. This
is a social meeting. Please join us to hear about our planned schedule for
the year. We are interested in hearing directly from you on the kinds of
application security talks and speakers you would like to see this year.

As part of Poison Girl's &quot;Drink Houston Better&quot; campaign, OWASP Houston is
hosting a social meeting at Poison Girl this Sunday, January 8th, starting
at 6PM. Proceeds from bar sales during the event will be generously donated
to our OWASP chapter.

Alert Logic, this meeting's sponsor, has offered to bring in food and buy
the first round of drinks (and maybe a second). Because this event is being
hosted at a bar it is 21+ only.

This will be a good chance to catch up and help shape the next year.

Please register on OWASP Houston Chapter MeetUp page:
<A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Houston/events/236732836/">https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Houston/events/236732836/</A>


Hope to see you there,

Houston OWASP Chapter leadership team
