Title: Effective Application Security Testing at High Velocity: Keeping up
with Agile and DevOps

Speaker: James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Rabon


Description:

In a world of competing requirements, how can application security keep up
with the rapid pace of development and still remain effective?

Agile and DevOps put pressure on development for more rapid deployments
while at the same time producing higher quality / more secure code.

Security is important (avoid the headlines!) but definitely not easy and
competes for resources.

Remediation of security vulnerabilities can be costly and cumbersome,
especially once the application is in production.



In this presentation, James Rabon will share lessons learned by working
with some of the most advanced and innovative application security
customers / programs. Learn how static and dynamic analysis of applications
can be made efficient and effective in some of the most dynamic development
organizations. See how app sec leaders integrate application security
throughout their software development lifecycle and include it in the
DevOps tool chain of automation to move security testing at high velocity.
Automation is your friend and we will examine where modern security tools
are being included in the &#8220;treat infrastructure as code&#8221; mantra. We&#8217;ll also
take a look beyond security tools and automation to the people and
processes that effective application security programs use to run at high
speed. A brief demo will follow for those interested.


Agenda:

6:00-6:30pm: Check-in, food, networking

6:30pm: Meeting start

6:45pm: Announcements, intros

7:00pm: Presentation - Vendor neutral &#8220;Best practices&#8221; presentation (7pm to

spotlight (15 to 20 mins) post-presentation: Fortify Demo, Q&amp;A &#8211; collect
business cards

Speaker Bio:


Jimmy Rabon began his career as a software developer for the Computer
Sciences Corp before deciding to specialize in application security over
seven years ago with Fortify.
He began his career in application security by serving as an on-site
subject matter expert for software security and has performed countless
security audits of applications (both static and dynamic testing reviews)
for several large commercial and government entities. He has enabled
organizations that utilized his or his team&#8217;s services, to find and fix
exploitable vulnerabilities in critical systems.


Having worked as a software engineer for many years prior to specializing
in application security, he understands the unique challenges that
developers face when attempting to deliver secure code and can help deliver
effective technology and processes to enable information assurance and
development teams to work together to make software as secure as possible.


He leads a team of highly skilled application security consultants as the
head of HPE Fortify professional services responsible for designing
effective software assurance
solutions in the Americas.


He is currently a Senior Product Manager with Fortify with a passion for
building security products that solve real world problems in the most
effective and efficient way possible.
