Title: Making Vulnerability Management Less Painful with OWASP DefectDojo

OWASP DefectDojo Project
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_DefectDojo_Project">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_DefectDojo_Project</A>


Abstract:

DefectDojo was created in 2013 when one security engineer at Rackspace
stupidly opened his mouth in front of his leadership team. Vulnerability
management is traditionally tedious, time consuming, and mentally draining.
DefectDojo attempts to streamline vulnerability management with automation
centered around templating, report generation, metrics, scanner
consolidation, and baseline self-service tools. DefectDojo is currently
used by multiple large enterprises and has core contributors from five
different companies. It has made several engineers' lives much easier, and
it can help you too. Got a ton of findings to consolidate and report on?
DefectDojo has you covered. Need to have a dashboard of your team&#8217;s work?
DefectDojo has you covered. Tired of boilerplate report generation?
DefectDojo does that for you. Come check out how to make vulnerability
management less painful and speed up your appsec program in this talk with
demo.


Speaker:

Greg Anderson is the project leader for OWASP DefectDojo. He will be
presenting remotely and the room works well for this format. Greg is a long
time member of OWASP and has held several different leadership positions.
You can find his bio on the official OWASP users page:
