outrageously fun discussions! Our mission is to provide an inclusive, open
environment for sharing and collaborative discourse on topics that most
interest you.

The first Austin event was great, which you know if you were there.
 Security BSides Austin 2011 will be even better. If you have thoughts,
comments, complaints, suggestions- or would like to volunteer, let us know.
 Join the BSides mailing list, or send a message to feedback(at)

When: March 11-12, 2011


Event Registration is now open- via Eventbrite

<A HREF="http://bsidesaustin2011.eventbrite.com/">http://bsidesaustin2011.eventbrite.com/</A>


Where:

The Walton-Joseph Building, 706-708 6th Street. That's right, we will be
right on 6th St, near everything (or at least near I-35, the transit center,
the convention center, bars, restaurants, and much more).  This historic
building was built C. 1884, and has served as a retail store, boarding
house, bar, church, shoeshine parlor, restaurant- and now a BSides Venue.
