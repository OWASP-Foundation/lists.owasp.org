Subject: [Owasp-Houston] Core Security (WebVerify) Trial License Offer
Message-ID: <EACCF2FC-F94F-4D78-96A4-4F8B1731266D@owasp.org>

OWASP Team,

In an effort to provide our members with new and interesting products - Core Security is offering our chapter a five day trial of their new Web Application Security Testing product, WebVerify.  See below for details.  

If you do decide to try/test the solution,...it will be going through their normal sales channels (so you will be contacted (i'm assuming) by an account executive).  However, i wanted to extend the offer to you since it's a (newer) solution to the marketplace.

Have a great weekend!

David

Fellow OWASPers, 

Hopefully by now you've heard the buzz around last year's Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON).  The conference was hosted by the Austin OWASP Chapter and featured some of the world's top security researchers including Robert "RSnake" Hansen, Samy Kamkar, Joe Jarzombek, and many more.  In it's first year, LASCON had over 160 attendees and the feedback was outstanding.  Here's just a few of examples of what 2010 LASCON attendees had to say about the conference:


With the lineup of presenters that you have for the LASCON Conference, I can't afford not to go. 
- Ian Robertson 


Just wanted to drop the LASCON organizers a note about how much I enjoyed the conference last Friday. Good venue, good food, good presentations, and good people. 
- Joel Burrow 


Thanks for understanding how us geeks think and putting on a conference that we can really enjoy being a part of. 
- Jay Paz 


With so much positive feedback coming out of LASCON 2010 it was a no brainer for our team to do it again this year.  We've already received commitments from Jeremiah Grossman, John Steven, Michael Howard, and many more.  Needless to say, this year's conference is gonna rock and we want you to be a part of it!  We've got special Early-Bird Pricing good through the end of July.  For the next two weeks OWASP members can attend LASCON for only $75.  Non-members can attend LASCON for $125 and that includes a $50 OWASP membership of which 40% goes to support your local chapter.  You may have missed out on last year's conference, but you won't want to miss what we have in store for LASCON 2011 happening October 28, 2011 at the Norris Conference Center in Austin, TX.  And be sure to plan on sticking around for the LASCON Happy Hour sponsored by Trustwave.  The mechanical bull is back!  We'll see you at LASCON!

OWASPers,

I just wanted to remind you all that the Lonestar Application Security
Conference (LASCON) Early-Bird registration rate ends on Sunday.  Currently
you can register to attend LASCON for only $75 as an OWASP member or $125
for a non-member which includes a year membership ($50 value).  However, as
of Monday, August 1st, the price goes up by $50.  If you're planning on
attending LASCON, now is the time to register before the price goes up.

LASCON is going down on October 28, 2011 at the Norris Conference Center in
Austin, TX.  This year we will have four to five tracks with topics
including Audit, Architecture, Development, and Executive Management.
That's right, bring your boss to LASCON!  The CFP for LASCON is still open
(submissions welcome), but speakers include Jeremiah Grossman, John Steven,
Rafal Los, Michael Howard, Joe Jarzombek, and many more.  We have a happy
hour event immediately after the conference sponsored by Trustwave and the
mechanical bull will be back.  We're looking forward to seeing you at
LASCON!
