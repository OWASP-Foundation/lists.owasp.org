OWASP Houston May Chapter Meeting
Tuesday May 23, 2017 at 6:00PM


Title:
Using Instrumentation and Sensors to drive Optimization in your Application
Security Program


Location:
Lucky?s Pub Downtown
801 St Emanuel Street,
Houston, TX 77003
http://luckyspub.com/locations/downtown/


Abstract:
In our physical world, we have instrumentation all around us. Clocks tell
us time, kitchen ovens tell us temperature, and apps remind us to take our
medication. Cars tell us speed, fuel level and even have onboard health
diagnostics. In our homes, we have security alerts when someone trespasses
our property or opens a door.

However, in the world of software, we have very little visibility into what
is going on inside the software. Our presenters will describe how
instrumentation can be used to enable your software applications to both
detect vulnerabilities and block attacks. Furthermore, they will
demonstrate the insights offered by using instrumentation and why this
approach can offer unique insights to your security program.

Girish Nair has been a software developer for more than two decades. He has
