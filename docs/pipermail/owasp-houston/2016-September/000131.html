<PRE>OWASP Houston October Chapter Meeting

Monday October 17, 2016 at 6:30PM

Title: Is Your Vulnerability Management Program Evolving? Introducing the
Vulnerability Management Maturity Model &#8211; VM3

Speaker: Gordon MacKay

Presentation Abstract:

Vulnerability management (VM) solutions and products that are central to
every information security program contain a serious &#8220;hidden&#8221; flaw. This
software flaw is interleaved within pattern matching-like algorithms
located deep within the foundational core of the most widely used automated
VM solutions on the market. As a direct consequence of this flaw, even
though these products report a certain level of network security risk, the
metric upon which their calculations are based is skewed, resulting in an
unintentional gap between the products&#8217; intended information risk
measurement and the erroneous measurement actually reported. This session
covers the technical details of the referred to hidden flaw, its
consequences and what you can do to limit your exposure.
