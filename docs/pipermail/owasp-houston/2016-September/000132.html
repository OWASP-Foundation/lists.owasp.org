<PRE>Gordon just reached out to me and told me about how he would like to update
this topic with something even more exciting. He is going to present a
Murder Mystery style discussion to uncover who is killing your InfoSec
program.

You won't want to miss this compelling presentation. We hope to see you
there. The EventBrite and OWASP Chapter pages have been updated with the
new title and abstract.

Please share with your friends and colleagues.

Thanks.

Joseph

OWASP Houston October Chapter Meeting

Monday October 17, 2016 at 6:30PM

Title: Murder Mystery &#8211; Who is Killing your Information Security Program

Speaker: Gordon MacKay

Presentation Abstract:

Integrating vulnerability scanning results into one&#8217;s security ecosystem
involves a serious hidden challenge which results in heinous consequences,
thereby killing your InfoSec program.  This session shares clues on this
challenge, step by step, in the form of a murder mystery game, and
ultimately reveals the culprit as well as strategies to overcome it.  Come
participate, play, and interact! Try to guess &#8220;who-dunnit,&#8221; and learn how
to avoid future similar InfoSec crimes.
