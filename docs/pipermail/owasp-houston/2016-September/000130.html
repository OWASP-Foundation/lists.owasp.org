OWASP Houston September Chapter Meeting
Monday September 19, 2016 at 6:30PM

Title: Web App Testing Stats Compared to The OWASP Top 10

Description:

For over seven years, Cigital has performed high volumes of application
security assessments through the Cigital Assessment Center (CAC). Over that
time the CAC has accumulated a large amount of data that provides helpful
insights into software security practices. We&#8217;ll present the most common
web application security vulnerabilities identified over one year by the
CAC, contrasting our findings with one of the industry&#8217;s leading
benchmarks, the OWASP Top 10.

Bio:

Joel Scambray is a Principal at Cigital, a leading software security
consulting firm established in 1992. He has helped Fortune 500-class
organizations address information security challenges for over twenty years
as a consultant, author and speaker, business leader, and entrepreneur. He
is widely recognized as co-author of the Hacking Exposed book series, and
has worked/consulted for companies including Microsoft, Foundstone, Amazon,
Costco, Softcard, and Ernst &amp; Young.

Building security requires the list of attendees with their full names by
the Friday prior to the meeting, so please signup by the Thursday before
the meeting.
