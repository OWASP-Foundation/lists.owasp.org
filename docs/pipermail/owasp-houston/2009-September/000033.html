<PRE>When possible, I like to test applications with several accounts of
varying privlege.  Testing with different roles helps me identify
business logical flaws and potential weaknesses in the authorization
scheme.  As an example, an admin account may help me discover an area of
an application that may not immediately be identifiable to a regular
user (accounting, reporting, admin functions).  I then attempt to force
browse or perform admin operations with an account that should not have
sufficient rights.

I usually ask for application admin (not OS admin) credentials from our
developers so we can do our automated web application scans. My thought
is that, like an OS scan with credentials, this gives the best bang for
the buck in exposing as many vulnerabilities within as short a time as
possible. I received this email from one of our Unix admins and wanted
to know your thoughts:

  I am just curious, why do you need an admin user id to scan an
application? An admin id will of course have more access than a normal
user id and the idea of limiting users to non-admin ids is to limit
their ability to break things. My understanding is that the scan is done
from the outside to determine if there are any security holes in the
application that need to be closed before the application is put into
production. Since we don't advertise the admin user id to the world, why
would we give the scanning software an admin id? Wouldn't a normal user
id do the trick?

Thanks for your thoughts,

Karl
