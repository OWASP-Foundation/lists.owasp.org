Topic - CRM Security

Abstract

Customer relationship management (CRM) systems are increasingly being used
by organizations to increase revenue and improve efficiencies within their
sales organizations. The overall objective of CRM is to identify, acquire,
and retain customers, meaning that these systems contain information that
has a direct impact on the competitive advantage of the organizaiton. It is
therefore critical that this information be protected from unauthorized
access or modification. This session will highlight the risks inherent
within these systems and how to address them from both a process and
technical perspective.

Speaker:

Mark is a subject matter expert in the area of IT security, compliance and
audit. He has almost seven years of experience working for &#8220;Big 4&#8221; public
