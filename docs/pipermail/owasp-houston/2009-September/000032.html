We'll typically try to get two sets of credentials for each role (just in case one account gets locked out).

You want to be able to exercise the entire application - all the pages, all the forms, etc.  You can only do this if the account(s) used to scan the application have access to the pages and features.  It may be that an admin account can access all the pages so you can get away with using just an admin account.  More often I have noticed that there is value in running an uncredentialed scan, a scan for a normal user with an account and a scan for an admin user (and so on based on how many roles there are in the application).

Having vulnerabilities accessible to only admin accounts is likely not acceptable.  Those may be prioritized with the same level of severity as publicly-accessible vulnerabilities, but you still need to know that they exist so they can be prioritized for remediation.  Don't forget about insider threats.

And it is important to understand that scans - even with admin credentials - aren't going to find all vulnerabilities.  Consider augmenting scanning with manual penetration as well as code review.

Thanks,

Dan

I usually ask for application admin (not OS admin) credentials from our
developers so we can do our automated web application scans. My thought is
that, like an OS scan with credentials, this gives the best bang for the
buck in exposing as many vulnerabilities within as short a time as possible.
I received this email from one of our Unix admins and wanted to know your
thoughts:

  I am just curious, why do you need an admin user id to scan an
application? An admin id will of course have more access than a normal user
id and the idea of limiting users to non-admin ids is to limit their ability
to break things. My understanding is that the scan is done from the outside
to determine if there are any security holes in the application that need to
be closed before the application is put into production. Since we don't
advertise the admin user id to the world, why would we give the scanning
software an admin id? Wouldn't a normal user id do the trick?

Thanks for your thoughts,

Karl
