<PRE>I usually ask for application admin (not OS admin) credentials from our
developers so we can do our automated web application scans. My thought is
that, like an OS scan with credentials, this gives the best bang for the
buck in exposing as many vulnerabilities within as short a time as possible.
I received this email from one of our Unix admins and wanted to know your
thoughts:

------begin quoted email-------

  I am just curious, why do you need an admin user id to scan an
application? An admin id will of course have more access than a normal user
id and the idea of limiting users to non-admin ids is to limit their ability
to break things. My understanding is that the scan is done from the outside
to determine if there are any security holes in the application that need to
be closed before the application is put into production. Since we don&#8217;t
advertise the admin user id to the world, why would we give the scanning
software an admin id? Wouldn&#8217;t a normal user id do the trick?
------end quoted email-------

Thanks for your thoughts,

Karl
