Please join us for another OWASP Houston Workshop. Stuart Dunsmore (GCIA,
GREM) will be leading a lesson on reverse engineering of malware by
dissecting some malware that was caught as part of a recent email campaign.
Additionally, Mukul Gupta (PhD, GCIA, GWEB, CISSP, CISA, CAP) will be
providing some crypto challenges. Join us to use your brain and a command
line to solve puzzles for prizes.

We have a new sponsor for this event. Karbach Brewery has donated a few
cases of their beer to get the creativity flowing. Pizza will be provided
by Alert Logic.

Food, drinks, and crypto puzzles served from 6:00-8:??, Stuart will speak
from 6:30 to 7:15. From 7:15 attendees may work through some of his lesson
on their own and ask Stuart questions. Malware samples will be provided to
the brave. If you intend on participating please bring a computer with a
virtual machine ready to go with IDA pro.

When you arrive at the event there will be parking on the first or sub
floor of the parking garage, take the stairs up one floor to the tiled walk
way that leads to the building. There will be an attendant to let you in
and direct you downstairs to the lower lobby where the meeting will be held.
