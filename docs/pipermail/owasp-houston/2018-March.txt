We had a great meeting with the Houston Java User Group in February. I know
that some people weren't able to attend, so I wanted to give you a chance
to find out more about what you missed.

If you would like a copy of the presentation or would like to learn more
about Checkmarx and their products, please contact Nick Futter. We do not
provide vendors with contact information of members or attendees, so you
will need to reach out directly to him if you would like to be contacted.
Nick's email address is nick.futter at checkmarx.com and he is CC'ed on this
email.

Thanks again to Checkmarx, Inc for sponsoring our meeting. More information
