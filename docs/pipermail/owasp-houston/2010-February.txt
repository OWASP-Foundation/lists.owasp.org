OWASP Houston,

I wanted to send out a quick note to let you all know that we will be
starting up our chapter meetings in March 2010 (not February as
indicated on our website).  Also - for the first meeting, we will be
hosting a free happy hour which will be sponsored by two web
application security vendors.  We will be sending out an email (and
reminders) for the happy hour in the next few days so please be on the
lookout for the note.

Have a great day!

David, Mark, Linda, Paul
