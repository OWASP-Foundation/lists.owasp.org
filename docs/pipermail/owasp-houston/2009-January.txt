Houston,

Several OWASP members pointed out that the Secure World Expo ( http://secureworldexpo.com/events/index.php?id=260 
  ) will be hosted on the same day (February 11th) as our proposed  
meeting date.  It was requested that our meeting be rescheduled for  
later in February so... I will be working with our sponsor and send  
out a new meeting date as soon as possible.

Also, we will be receiving a discount code for our OWASP chapter which  
will give members a $245 price reduction.  I will forward the discount  
code out to our membership as soon as I receive it from the folks at  
Secure World.

David

Message-ID: <ECC6851A-BE0D-4FEA-85E1-8CF93A9461F0@icrew.org>

OWASP Houston,

As we kickoff 2009, we would like to invite anyone in our OWASP  
Chapter to submit presentation topics for review.  If you are  
interested in presenting at an upcoming meeting, please submit your  
topic via email to:

	icrew_at_owasp.org

To provide an idea of what might be applicable...

   * Web Services and Application Security
   * Common Application related Threats and Risks
   * Business Risks with Application Security
   * "Cloud" Security
   * Vulnerability Research in Application Security
   * Web Application Penetration Testing
   * OWASP Tools and Projects
   * Secure Coding Practices
   * Technology specific presentations on security such as AJAX, XML,  
etc.
   * Anything else relating to OWASP and Application Security.


We are continuously seeking out fun and interesting topics (from  
vendors, consultants, etc), but we would like to encourage personal  
growth within our local organization as well.

Regards,

David
