<PRE>OWASP and Houston Java User Group Members,
Would you like to give back to the community and help college students
learn how to effectively create secure web applications? If so, there is an
ideal way for you to make meaningful contributions. You can become part of
a team that helps students get started on the right foot.

You may not know it, but each community college district in the state of
Texas is required to seek input from industry professionals to validate
their teaching approach and course coverage. Advisory Committees fill this
very important role.

Terry Hanks, one of the Computer Information Technology Department
instructors at the San Jacinto College &#8211; South Campus, is currently seeking
members for the Web Development Certificate and Degree program. He needs
about 20 industry professionals to meet and provide guidance for this
program.

The date is not yet set in stone, but it would be either Thursday March 23
or Thursday March 30. It would be held at the South Campus at 6:30PM with a
meal provided. I can attest that there is always plenty of good food at
these meetings as I have been a part of the district's advisory board for
many years.

If you are willing to become a part of this vital team, please reach out to
Terry and let him know which night would work best for you. His email
address is CC'ed on this email and his full contact information is listed
below.

Please feel free to forward this email to any of your friends or colleagues
that would be a good fit for this effort. Once Terry has finalized the
committee members and the best date, he will send out the invite for the
meeting.

Thanks for your consideration.
