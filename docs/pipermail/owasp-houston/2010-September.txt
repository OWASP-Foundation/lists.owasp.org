Hello Texas OWASPers!

After a long and difficult RFP selection process, the LASCON planning
committee has come to an agreement on the presentations for the first-ever
Lonestar Application Security Conference.  The conference will be held at
the Norris Conference Center in Austin, TX on Friday, October 29, 2010.
Registrations are $50 for OWASP members and $100 for Non-Members which
includes a year of OWASP membership.  We have extended the registration
discount deadline for one additional week to give you all a chance to look
over the speaker list, but after 9/24 the price goes up by $50 assuming they
are still available.  We are well over halfway to our targeted registration
number and are closing in fast on selling out.  Register today at:

And now.....the moment you've all been waiting for.....the tentative LASCON
2010 Presentation Schedule....

SEE ATTACHED JPEG FOR SCHEDULE

We haven't updated the website yet with this information, but it will be up
there shortly along with presentation abstracts and bios for all of the
presenters.  We sincerely hope that you are as excited about the lineup as
we are and will register today for LASCON 2010!

We would like to thank Gemalto, WhiteHat, Splunk, and Impact Security LLC
for their generous sponsorships of LASCON 2010.

Subject: [Owasp-Houston] LASCON: Last Day for Early-Bird Discount!
Message-ID: <AANLkTinopDXwqczPkXrcTSjDfE7hZr623z11kdzF9Exq@mail.gmail.com>

Well over 100 people have registered so far for the Lonestar Application
Security Conference (LASCON) happening in Austin on October 29, 2010, but
are you one of them?  We are well on our way to our goal of selling this
thing out and if you're stalling, you might just miss your opportunity to
see 20 of the country's top security minds for as low as 30$!  If you
haven't registered at this point, what are you waiting for?  *After today,
the early-bird discount ends and prices go up.*  But you're thrifty, right?
You know a good deal when  you see one.  Certainly you want to be "in the
know" on Monday when everyone around the water cooler is talking about how
Samy met your girlfriend, don't you?  And don't forget that you still need
to get more CPEs before the end of the year.  Your security peers from all
around the state are attending LASCON and you should too!

Registration is easy.  Just go to http://guest.cvent.com/d/vdqf7g/4W and
enter your name and e-mail address.  Tell us whether you're an OWASP member
or not (we do validate against the OWASP membership list).  If not, you pay
an extra $50 which is just the cost of a full year of OWASP membership.
Enter your credit card number.  Done.  Now we'll see you at the Norris
Conference Center in just over a month!

In case you haven't seen it yet, here's a big list of everyone who is
presenting at LASCON:

*Keynote*
Matt Tesauro (OWASP Foundation Board Member)

Another Factor

*Speed Debates*
We're still working on the rules, but effectively two security professionals
will be selected to square off against eachother in a debate on a relevant
security topic.  We will assign an affirmative and a negative and give them
each a short period of time to persuade the judges that they are right.  The
judges will vote and we will determine a winner for the debate.  The debates
will feature many of our esteemed LASCON presenters and maybe even YOU?!?!

For more information on LASCON, please see our website at
http://www.lascon.org.  As always, we would like to thank our generous gold
sponsors Gemalto, WhiteHat Security, Splunk, and Impact Security, LLC for
helping to make LASCON the best application security conference in Texas.
