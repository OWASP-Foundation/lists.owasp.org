OWASP Houston,

I wanted to inform you of a new Information Security group which will
be located here in the Houston area.  The group is called "NAISG" and
it is an international organization that provides and coordinates
security-focused meetings, demonstrations and seminars; as well as an
online communications forum with a global audience.  The next meeting
will be held on November 2nd at 6:30pm at the Microsoft Offices on
Beltway 8 (where the OWASP meetings were originally held).

If you are interested -- the details are below.

David

1. INAUGURAL NOVEMBER MEETING (11/2, 6:30 PM)

     Add the meeting to your calendar!  All meeting notices are
available in ICS format so that you can
     easily add them to your Outlook or other ICS-compliant calendar
system.  Access the ICS file at http://houston.naisg.org/meetings.

     Presentation: "Breaking Down the Enterprise Security Assessment"
     Many enterprise security assessments look at too few attack
vectors or do not dig far enough into the attack vectors once a
vulnerability has been discovered.
	 Come join a discussion on the breakdown of a security assessment,
explore the essential attack vectors, and debate the depth to which
the assessment should
	 go.  Presented by Michael R. Farnum, CISSP

     >> If you have not yet done so, please send a courtesy e-mail to
Meetings-Houston at naisg.org indicating that you plan to attend the
meeting
     so that we can order the correct quantity of pizza.  This month's
pizza will be sponsored by Network Box (http://www.networkboxusa.com).

     The meeting will be on Monday, November 2 at 6:30 PM.   It will
be held at the Microsoft office on West Sam Houston Parkway.
     [Directions are on our Web site at http://houston.naisg.org.]
The meeting will start with mingling time, then a short presentation
	 officially kicking off the chapter, which will then be followed by
the presentation and a Q&A period.

2. MEETINGS COUNT TOWARD YOUR CISSP RECERTIFICATION
     During the three year recertification period, each CISSP must
earn 120 continuing professional education (CPE) credits.
     Your attendance at NAISG meetings is valid toward these credits.
If you are a CISSP, please print a copy of the form at
     http://houston.naisg.org/Meetings and bring it to the meeting.
Give it to the meeting moderator to sign, after which you
     can submit it to (ISC)2 as needed.  Details on the
recertification requirements are at
https://www.isc2.org/cgi-bin/content.cgi?category=24.

3. NETWORK WITH OTHER NAISG MEMBERS ON LINKEDIN
