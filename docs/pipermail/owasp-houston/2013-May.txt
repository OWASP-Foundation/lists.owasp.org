We are pleased to have the following speakers and topics for the evening:

*Catching Flies with Mr Miyagi: Web Application Testing Techniques by Kevin
Johnson*

In this talk based loosely around the Karate kid movies, Kevin John (CEO of
Secure Ideas) will walk through some techniques to improve your web
penetration testing techniques.  Stop being the kid moved from NJ and
dropped into a cruddy apartment.  Learn the wax on/off of testing modern
web applications.

Kevin has performed a large number of trainings, briefings, and
presentations for both public events and internal trainings. Kevin teaches
for the SANS Institute on a number of subjects. He is the author of three
classes- SEC542: Web Application Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking,
SEC642: Advanced Web Application Penetration Testing, and SEC571: Mobile
Device Security. Kevin has presented at a large number of conventions,
meetings, and industry events. Some examples of these are: DerbyCon,
ShmooCon, DEFCON, Blackhat, ISACA, Infragard, and ISSA.

*WTF, WAF Testing Framework by Terry Ray*

Terry Ray will be presenting an approach to evaluating web application
firewall capabilities that is suitable to the real world use case. The
methodology touches on issues like False Positive / False Negative rates,
evasion techniques and white listing / black listing balance. He will
demonstrate a tool that can be used by organizations to implement the
methodology either when choosing an application protection solution or
after deployment.

Subject: [Owasp-Houston] May OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting: Attend Remotely
Message-ID: <51A0DAB1.7010007@owasp.org>

 Austin OWASPers,

See below for the following announcements. As previously mentioned, we
are also offering a remote Webinar session for those who want to attend
remotely.

Thanks

    May OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting -- Dustin Kirkland, Gazzang.com

*When:* Tuesday, May 28th, from 11:30am-1:30pm

*Where:*/'/ National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

*Topic: * Encrypt Everything Everywhere (but *especially* in the Cloud)

*Abstract: *

72% of the 21 million U.S. health care records that have been
compromised since 2009 should have been trivially protected using
comprehensive encryption of the data before being written to disk (see:
http://1.usa.gov/a2UGEG). A busy cloud compute node from OpenStack or
Amazon EC2 might spin up thousands of instances per day. Ephemeral,
block, and object storage - each and every one of these should always be
encrypted before being written to the underlying physical media. The
good news is multiple excellent file and disk encryption solutions exist
in Linux, such as eCryptfs and dm-crypt,making encrypting everything
simple and cost-effective.This session is designed for security
professionals, IT decision makers and solution architects. We'll discuss
encryption and key management best practices and examine use cases for
companies that store sensitive and regulated data in the cloud.

*Speaker Bio:* Dustin Kirkland is the CTO at Gazzang, delivering data
security and encryption for cloud computing and big data using eCryptfs,
dmcrypt, and an innovative key management system called zTrustee. Dustin
is also an active Core Developer of the Ubuntu Linux distribution,
maintainer of 20+ open source projects, and the creator of Byobu,
zEscrow, DivItUp.com, and LinuxSearch.org. A Fightin' Texas Aggie Class
of 2001 graduate, Dustin lives in Austin, Texas, with his wife Kim,
daughter, and his two Australian Shepherds, Aggie and Tiger.

*Cost:* Free!

*Lunch:* Provided by LASCON! Please RSVP so we can order enough food.
