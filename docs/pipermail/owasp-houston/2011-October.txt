Houston OWASP!

HouSecCon 2010 was a huge success! Now take a moment to check out HouSecCon
2011, THE Houston Security Conference (Nov 3, 2011).

HouSecCon does not serve a single Information Security industry vertical or
give only one side of InfoSec. HouSecCon attracts everyone from the security
noob to the CIO with a mix of hacker con with management con. And HouSecCon
does this across all industry verticals (retail, healthcare, energy,
telecomm, etc). These attributes give HouSecCon a unique flavor in the
Houston area and the InfoSec conference world.

Subjects include Cloud Security, Cloud Compliance, Mobile Device Security,
Threat Landscapes Affected by APT, Web Application Security with new web
apps, ARM Processor Security, Data Exfiltraton and Confidentiality, Social
Engineering Attack Techniques, and more.

OWASP Houston,

Interested in attending the Houston Security Conference,...but a little
short on cash?  We have been allocated ten (10) free tickets to the show
which will be given out on a first come basis.  If you would like to attend,
please email David Nester at dnester at gmail.com and the first ten folks will
be put on the list.  If you do accept one of the free tickets, we do ask you
to confirm that you will indeed use the ticket (we don't want the free ones
going to waste).

Have a great day!

David
