<PRE>We're down to less than a dozen tickets for the Mini-con on May 16th.
Remember tickets don't just get you seats they get you drink tickets! If we
run out of tickets, there will be some standing room so don't feel bad if
you get this message late and we're out of tickets.

register now! &lt;<A HREF="https://owasp-houston-may-mini-con.eventbrite.com/">https://owasp-houston-may-mini-con.eventbrite.com/</A>&gt;

Please join us for our May Mini-Con, 6PM May 16th, at the Sheraton Suites,
2400 W. Loop South, Houston, Texas 77027. We're trying a new location this
time. This is a free event, but space is limited. We will be providing food
and beverage. Please register for a ticket to confirm your space at the
event. If tickets are unavailable, we will have some standing room.

We are pleased to have the following speakers and topics for the evening:

*Catching Flies with Mr Miyagi: Web Application Testing Techniques by Kevin
Johnson*

In this talk based loosely around the Karate kid movies, Kevin John (CEO of
Secure Ideas) will walk through some techniques to improve your web
penetration testing techniques.  Stop being the kid moved from NJ and
dropped into a cruddy apartment.  Learn the wax on/off of testing modern
web applications.

Kevin has performed a large number of trainings, briefings, and
presentations for both public events and internal trainings. Kevin teaches
for the SANS Institute on a number of subjects. He is the author of three
classes- SEC542: Web Application Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking,
SEC642: Advanced Web Application Penetration Testing, and SEC571: Mobile
Device Security. Kevin has presented at a large number of conventions,
meetings, and industry events. Some examples of these are: DerbyCon,
ShmooCon, DEFCON, Blackhat, ISACA, Infragard, and ISSA.

*WTF, WAF Testing Framework by Terry Ray*

Terry Ray will be presenting an approach to evaluating web application
firewall capabilities that is suitable to the real world use case. The
methodology touches on issues like False Positive / False Negative rates,
evasion techniques and white listing / black listing balance. He will
demonstrate a tool that can be used by organizations to implement the
methodology either when choosing an application protection solution or
after deployment.
