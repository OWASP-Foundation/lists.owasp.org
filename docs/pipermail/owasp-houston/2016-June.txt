Meeting Agenda:

1. Introductions of all attendees to gain a solid understanding of
backgrounds, interests, and what people would like to learn about.

2. Upcoming security related conferences - LASCON in Austin, Cyber Texas in
San Antonio

3. Major OWASP Projects that have been updated recently or currently being
worked on: OWASP Top 10 - 2016 Data Call discussion question review.
Proactive Controls, ASVS 3, Developer Guide reboot, OpenSAMM, WAFEC
updates, OWASP Testing Guide, WebGoat 7

4. Discussion about possible study groups that we want to start having. For
example, CISSP or CSSLP certification preparation, Hacking-Live CD
interactive sessions. OWASP ZAP workshop (leveraging bodgeit, WebGoat, and
Security Shepherd), other books or projects people would like to pursue.

5. Topics that people would like to see discussed at the next meeting and
how often they would like to meet. Ideally, we could meet once a month for
the normal meeting and then at least twice a month for study groups. This
has been very successful for the Austin chapter.

Subject: [Owasp-Houston] Study group book choices
Message-ID: <CAEqmOud0H8duJ3-S-AN0hsnFt2xuE9mZ+VjMiHhT88emULgG8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm going to be working through some of these books on my own if anyone
would like to join in either in any form or fashion. In person, online,
guided book club style or just group communication to get help with.

I am currently using Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and
Pentesters by Justin Seitz but also have these books if y'all would prefer
to work on something else.

   - Reverse Engineering for Beginners - Dennis Yurichev(highly regarded,
   beginner friendly, and works well withchallenges.re site)
   - Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands?on Guide to Dissecting Malicious
   Software - Andrew Honig and Michael Sikorski(completely self contained,
   seems to cover everything yet is the most beginner friendly)
   - Designing BSD Rootkits: An Introduction to Kernel Hacking - Joseph
   Kong(this seems rather detailed and might require some decent C knowledge
   and nix experience).

If you're interested let me know and what method works best. I'll setup a
Telegram group once some more people join for easier communication.

Regards,
Rory Carson
