Hey Texas OWASPers,

The largest Information Security Conference to happen in this region in
years is just over a week away.  On 10/23-10/24 (Training) and 10/25-10/26
(Conference) an estimated 800-1000 security professionals will be gathering
at the Hyatt in downtown Austin, TX.  This conference has been to New York,
Washington DC, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis, but this is the first time it
has ever been in Texas and we can't say when (if ever) it will be back.
The official schedule is online at http://schedule.appsecusa.org and
features some of the industries most sought-after speakers.  We have a host
of other events surrounding it including a movie sneak preview, an epic
happy hour featuring a performance by Dual Core, and a 10k race.  We have a
very limited number of badges remaining and time is running out.  Register
today for only $595!

REGISTER HERE:  http://www.cvent.com/d/6cq1lj/4W

See you next week!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol
Co-Chair, OWASP AppSec USA 2012
