Georgia Weidman will present:

*Can You Hear Me Now? Leveraging Mobile Devices on Pentests* BYOD is not a
new concept. From contractor laptops to an employee?s game console in the
break room, a compromised device in the corporate environment can lead to
all sorts of bad things. In this talk we will look at the unique threats
that BYOD for mobile devices brings to the table. The most security
conscious corporations are deploying the latest devices and policies to
stop attackers from breaching the perimeter and if they do to stop data
exfiltration. We will discuss how mobile devices on a corporate network
and/or handling company data undermines these efforts. We will look at
multiple mobile platforms gathering sensitive information, attacking other
devices such as other mobile devices, servers, and workstations, and using
out of band communication to perform data exfiltration and communicate with
internal devices. Multiple live demo scenarios will be shown and some
useful code for pentesters will be released.

*Speaker Bio:*

Georgia has worked in information security in both the public and private
sectors. She recently founded her own security firm, Bulb Security LLC
focusing on security training, research and development, and penetration
testing. She began speaking at security conferences at Shmoocon 2011 and
has had a full schedule ever since, presenting all over the world. To name
a few she has spoken at Security Zone, Takedowncon, Hacker Halted, Defcon
Wireless Village, and many Bsides events.

Georgia was recently awarded a DARPA Cyber Fast Track grant to continue her
smartphone security research. Georgia?s security work has been featured in
print articles including Ars Technica, PC World, and MIT Technology Review.
She?s also discussed security on television on programs such as Fox News
Live and 16?9 on Global TV Canada.


Clint Pollack will present:

*Tips for Building a Successful Application Security Program*
Application vulnerabilities are steeply on the rise. At $350 billion per
year software is the largest manufacturing industry in the world yet there
are no uniform standards or insight into security, risk or liability of the
final product.  The development environment is becoming increasingly
complex ? application origin ranges from internally developed code,
outsourced, 3rd party, Open Source, and Commercial Off the Shelf software.
Ensuring these entities are creating secure software is becoming a daunting
task.  Lots of emphasis is placed on IT controls, patching, etc, but the
new attack vector is your applications.  During this presentation we will
recap the state of software security today and discuss detailed actions you
can take to build a successful application security program that is
centralized, policy-driven, and comprehensive.

Houston,

Every year a group of individuals including researchers, developers,
security professionals and others work to ensure the security of web
applications. Some of these individuals are featured in news stories or at

recognized.

    August OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting

*When:* Tuesday, August 27th, from 11:30am-1:00pm

*Where:* National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C


*Title:* Static Code Analysis: Is it safe to go back in the water?

*Abstract:* With a reputation for high cost, difficult deployment, and
high skillset requirements, static analysis has been put on the back
burner in many app sec programs in favor of activities like pen testing
with lower barriers to entry. As tools and techniques mature, people are
moving beyond pen testing and re-investigating static analysis to bring
more precise and earlier-in-the-dev-cycle improvements to code security
quality. Join two leading industry experts in a discussion of current
security code review practices, real-world case studies, what works and
what doesn't, plus technical and business drivers you need to know to
get a code review capability off the ground in your organization.
