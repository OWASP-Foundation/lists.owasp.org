<PRE>Houston OWASP,

Our next chapter meeting will be held on September 9, 2009 at Houston
Community College.  Below are the details for the next meeting, but we will
also be sending out a google calendar invite shortly.  If you are going to

below).

We look forward to seeing you there!

TOPIC: &quot;Conducting Application Assessment&quot;

SPEAKER(S): Dan Cornell, OWASP, Denim Group

ABSTRACT: This talk will review a number of application assessment
techniques and discuss the types of security vulnerabilities they are best
suited to identify as well as how the different approaches can be used in
combination to produce more thorough and insightful results. Code review
will be compared to penetration testing and the capabilities of automated
tools will be compared to manual techniques. In addition, the role of threat
modeling and architecture analysis will be examined. The goal is to
illuminate assessment techniques that go beyond commodity point-and-click
approaches to web application or code scanning.



Date: Wednesday, September 9th
Time: 6:00 - 7:30pm

Location: HCC
1010 West Sam Houston Parkway North
