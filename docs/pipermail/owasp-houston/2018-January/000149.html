Title: App Security Really Will Make You Money!

Description:

When organizations think of application security they typically think of
technology features and functions. In this talk Checkmarx discusses how
Application Security can actually help drive an organization's bottom line
and internal processes. In this age of ever expanding risk to
organizations, Application Security can be used to expand your customer
base, drive compliance, and expand the knowledge of an organization's
executives and employees.

Meeting Location: PROS
3100 Main
2nd floor
Room B
Houston, TX 77002

Meeting Sponsor: Checkmarx, Inc

Checkmarx, founded in 2006, is a leader in application security solutions,
having developed the first platform for true Source Code Analysis (SCA)
with its marquee solution: Static Application SecurityTesting (SAST).

Our mission is in enabling organizations to secure applications from the
start, reducing risk and cost along the way.

Our platforms offer maximum application security for software developers
