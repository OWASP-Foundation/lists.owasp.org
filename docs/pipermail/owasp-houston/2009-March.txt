Message-ID: <4122F6F18CC18A4FBE1DCBA11348F0AB031A2465@satmail.denimgroup.com>

All:

If you are planning on attending the Texas Regional Infrastructure Security Conference (TRISC) <http://www.trisc.org/> this year, we have it set up so that OWASP members get a $100 discount on their registration.  Seeing as how OWASP individual membership is only $50 this is a pretty good deal!

More information about OWASP Membership can be found here: <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership>

When you go to register for TRISC indicate that you are an OWASP member and include your OWASP membership number.  If you have only recently become a member put "NUMBER PENDING" in the member number field and I will work with the TRISC folks and Kate Hartmann to make sure you are actually a member.

This is going to be a great conference - hope to see folks there.

Thanks,

Dan

All:

The good news: Folks seem to be excited about using their Membership in OWASP to get a $100 discount on the TRISC conference.  Hooray!

The bad news: I screwed up!  Boo!

They have some validation on the TRISC registration website that isn't accepting OWASP membership numbers.  D'Oh!  To register as an OWASP attendee, please use the number 55555001 for registration.  I'll manually go and verify folks' membership offline so kindly don't cheat.  (Obviously please don't share this number.)

A $50 OWASP Individual Membership gets you a $100 discount on TRISC.  You can't beat the math.

The TRISC website is here: <http://www.trisc.org/>

The OWASP Membership website is here: <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership>

Thanks,

Dan

OWASP-Houston,

Our meeting that was scheduled for this evening at 5:30 p.m. at the
Microsoft Office in Houston has been cancelled due to lack of
participation.

 

Recently OWASP Houston sent a survey to each of you to solicit your
suggestions to make this chapter a success.  We appreciate those that
responded, and as a result of your responses, we are planning future
meetings according to requests regarding the location, time, and topics
of interest.

 

Please stay tuned for updated meeting announcement.  If you have any
questions and/or comments, please feel free to contact David Nester or
myself.

 

Best Regards,

Message-ID: <4122F6F18CC18A4FBE1DCBA11348F0AB031A2F8D@satmail.denimgroup.com>

All:

As I have mentioned before, OWASP members get a $100 discount on TRISC 2009 attendance.  Seeing as how OWASP membership now costs $50 that is a great deal.  Bailout!  Just register for TRISC and use the OWASP membership number 55555001 (kindly don't share that number with non-OWASP folks)

There isn't a formal application security track at TRISC this year (yet!), so I thought I would put together a list of the application security-focused talks.  For OWASP San Antonio we will be treating TRISC as our March meeting (regular meetings to resume in April).  For the rest of Texas I hope to see everyone there!

Monday:
1:00: Ballroom A: Rohyt Belani - Phishing 2.0
      Ballroom B: David Lissberger - Hacking Through a Firewall
2:00: Ballroom B: Josh Sokol - Using Proxies to Secure Applications and More
3:15: Ballroom B: Robert Hansen & Rob MacDougal - Assessing Your Web App Manually Without Hacking It

Tuesday:
8:30: Keynote: Johnny Long
12:45: Ballroom A: Trey Ford - Top Website Vulnerabilities: Trends, Business Effects, How To Fight Them
       Ballroom B: Mano Paul - Web 0wn3d (OWASP Top 10) In Depth & Demonstrated
1:45: Ballroom B: Matt Tesauro - OWASP Live CD: An Open Environment for Web Application Security
      Amphitheater: John Dickson - The Permanent Campaign: Driving a Secure Software Initiative in the Enterprise
3:15: Ballroom B: Securing SharePoint
4:15: Ballroom A: Joseph Krull - PCI Compliance - Convert Drudgery Into a Powerful Security Framework
      Ballroom B: Erhan Kartaltepe & Ravi Ganesan - A New Standard for Establishing Trust in Cross Domain XHR
