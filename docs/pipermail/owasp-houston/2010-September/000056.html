<PRE>Hello Texas OWASPers!

After a long and difficult RFP selection process, the LASCON planning
committee has come to an agreement on the presentations for the first-ever
Lonestar Application Security Conference.  The conference will be held at
the Norris Conference Center in Austin, TX on Friday, October 29, 2010.
Registrations are $50 for OWASP members and $100 for Non-Members which
includes a year of OWASP membership.  We have extended the registration
discount deadline for one additional week to give you all a chance to look
over the speaker list, but after 9/24 the price goes up by $50 assuming they
are still available.  We are well over halfway to our targeted registration
number and are closing in fast on selling out.  Register today at:

And now.....the moment you've all been waiting for.....the tentative LASCON
2010 Presentation Schedule....

SEE ATTACHED JPEG FOR SCHEDULE

We haven't updated the website yet with this information, but it will be up
there shortly along with presentation abstracts and bios for all of the
presenters.  We sincerely hope that you are as excited about the lineup as
we are and will register today for LASCON 2010!

We would like to thank Gemalto, WhiteHat, Splunk, and Impact Security LLC
for their generous sponsorships of LASCON 2010.

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
President
Austin OWASP
