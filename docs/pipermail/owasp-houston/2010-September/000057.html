<PRE>Well over 100 people have registered so far for the Lonestar Application
Security Conference (LASCON) happening in Austin on October 29, 2010, but
are you one of them?  We are well on our way to our goal of selling this
thing out and if you're stalling, you might just miss your opportunity to
see 20 of the country's top security minds for as low as 30$!  If you
haven't registered at this point, what are you waiting for?  *After today,
the early-bird discount ends and prices go up.*  But you're thrifty, right?
You know a good deal when  you see one.  Certainly you want to be &quot;in the
know&quot; on Monday when everyone around the water cooler is talking about how
Samy met your girlfriend, don't you?  And don't forget that you still need
to get more CPEs before the end of the year.  Your security peers from all
around the state are attending LASCON and you should too!

Registration is easy.  Just go to <A HREF="http://guest.cvent.com/d/vdqf7g/4W">http://guest.cvent.com/d/vdqf7g/4W</A> and
enter your name and e-mail address.  Tell us whether you're an OWASP member
or not (we do validate against the OWASP membership list).  If not, you pay
an extra $50 which is just the cost of a full year of OWASP membership.
Enter your credit card number.  Done.  Now we'll see you at the Norris
Conference Center in just over a month!

In case you haven't seen it yet, here's a big list of everyone who is
presenting at LASCON:

*Keynote*
Matt Tesauro (OWASP Foundation Board Member)

*Technical Track*
James Flom (COO, Co-Founder, SecTheory) - Why ha.ckers.org Doesn't Get
Hacked
Dan Cornell (Principal, Denim Group) - Smart Phones with Dumb Apps: Threat
Modeling for Mobile Applications
Chris Eng (Director of Security Research, Veracode) - Deconstructing
ColdFusion
Robert Hansen (CEO, Founder, SecTheory) and Josh Sokol (Information Security
Program Owner, National Instruments) - HTTPS Can Byte Me
Samy &quot;MySpace Worm&quot; Kamkar (Co-Founder, Director of Engineering, Fonality,
Inc.) - How I Met Your Girlfriend

*Management Track*
Charlie Scott and Jay Paz (Information Security Office, UT Austin) -
Conducting an Institution-Wide, Multi-Department Application Security
Assessment
Joy Jarzombek (Director for Software Assurance, National Cyber Division,
Dept of Homeland Security) - Mitigating Business Risks with Application
Security
Michael Howard (Principal Security Program Manager, Microsoft) - Everything
Useful I Learned About Software Security, I Learned at Microsoft
Eric Pace Birkholz (Director of Channels, Special Operations, WhiteHat
Security) - Security Religions and Risk Windows
Ernest Mueller (Web Systems Architect, National Instruments) - Cloud

*OWASP Etcetera Track*
Dean Bushmiller (Expanding Security) - OWASP Top 10: What is it all about?
Brad Causey (Senior Security Analyst, BBVA Compass) - Automating Web Testing
Beyond OWASP Webscarab Using Python
No Bar-yosef, Rob Rachwald, and Amichai Shulman (Imperva) - Tell Me Your IP
and I Will Tell You Who You Are
Karen Lu and Asad Ali (Gemalto) - Enhancing Web Application Security Using
Another Factor
Charles Henderson and David Byrne (Trustwave) - Anatomy of a Logic Flaw

*Speed Debates*
We're still working on the rules, but effectively two security professionals
will be selected to square off against eachother in a debate on a relevant
security topic.  We will assign an affirmative and a negative and give them
each a short period of time to persuade the judges that they are right.  The
judges will vote and we will determine a winner for the debate.  The debates
will feature many of our esteemed LASCON presenters and maybe even YOU?!?!

For more information on LASCON, please see our website at
<A HREF="http://www.lascon.org.">http://www.lascon.org.</A>  As always, we would like to thank our generous gold
sponsors Gemalto, WhiteHat Security, Splunk, and Impact Security, LLC for
helping to make LASCON the best application security conference in Texas.

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
Information Security Program Owner
National Instruments
