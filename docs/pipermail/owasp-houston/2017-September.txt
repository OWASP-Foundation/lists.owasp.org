Subject: [Owasp-Houston] No September meeting due to Hurricane Harvey
	recovery
Message-ID: <CAN2198Qb4pH0cUMGH4DvNvT4ahLJ_YdjX03rY4y2oNiHwaJL0Q@mail.gmail.com>

We will not have a September meeting as many people need time to recover
from the recent hurricane. I will send out an update as soon as the next
meeting time and speaker are lined up.

Please email me directly if you have any suggestions or would like to
present at an upcoming meeting.

Joseph

All,

With the *acknowledgement by Equifax*
<http://fortune.com/2017/09/14/equifax-data-breach-security-apache-struts/>
that the massive breach of over 143 million customer records was caused by
an unpatched vulnerability in Struts2. We try and slow down a bit to talk
about who is responsible for this, the creators of the open source
solutions or the people who use them. *In this video broadcast
<http://blog.sonatype.com/struts2-vulnerabilities-who-is-responsible>*, we
speak with David Blevins, CEO of TomiTribe and Brian Fox, CTO of Sonatype.
Both are members of *Apache Software Foundation* <https://www.apache.org/>.

This is directly related to the *OWASP Top 10 - A9
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities>*,
Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities.

If you can't view YouTube videos, you can listen to the *entire
podcast, **Struts2
Vulnerabilities: Who Is Responsible* on the OWASP 24/7 Podcast Channel
