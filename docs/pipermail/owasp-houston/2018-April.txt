Meeting Location:
PROS
3100 Main
2nd floor, Room B
Houston, TX 77002

Presentation Title: A phased approach to building security automation into
your CI/CD

Abstract:

So your engineering team is using CI / CD and churning out code at a
frenetic pace. It is unclear where the risk is, what controls to focus on
and where in the SDLC to introduce those controls. Mahesh will introduce a
practical, risk-based approach to introducing security automation into the
CI / CD pipeline to surface critical issues, shorten remediation time
without bottlenecking the release. Finally, he will touch on the concepts
of interactive analysis (IAST) and runtime protection (RASP) as key tools
in this approach.

Speaker: Mahesh Babu, Head of Product Strategy, Contrast Security

Speaker Bio:

Mahesh is responsible for growing Contrast Protect. He takes every
opportunity to tell everyone how Contrast has fundamentally changed

career as a security researcher at the CERIAS center at Purdue University.
He then went on to build and scale large security & privacy programs a
