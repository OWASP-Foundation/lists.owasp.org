<PRE>Everyone,

This is a reminder that the OWASP Houston informal kick-off
meeting is only one week away.  Please feel free to spread the word and
confirm your attendance at meetup.com/owasp-houston.  If you know others
who are interested, please have them subscribe to the OWASP Houston email
distribution list.  We look forward to meeting everyone and gaining your insight
for a great 2013 kick-off.  Thanks!


Sponsors:  Imperva and Alert Logic
The wait is over! OWASP Houston is here!  We will have an informal kick-off
meeting 6PM-8PM on Monday, November 19th at Stag's Head Pub in their
private meeting room. This is just two weeks away. Please join us to help
shape OWASP Houston before you leave for the holidays.

When: November 19th, 2012 (6PM - 8PM)
Where: Stag's Head Pub - 2128 Portsmouth Street Houston, TX 77098
Sponsored By: Imperva and Alert Logic

The goal of this kick-off is to meet local security professionals and make
decisions regarding the OWASP Houston 2013 series of meetings. Please take
a moment to complete this five question survey. We will be announcing
aggregate results at the meeting and try to make a decision for a quarterly
meeting space.

Five question survey &lt;<A HREF="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RWNWRZX">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RWNWRZX</A>&gt;

If you can make it to the meeting, great. Please RSVP on our meetup page so
we can have some expectation of attendance. Food and drinks are courtesy of
our sponsors for the evening, Imperva and Alert Logic. Many thanks to both
organizations for taking a chance sponsoring a new chapter.

RSVP at meetup.com &lt;<A HREF="http://meetup.com/owasp-houston">http://meetup.com/owasp-houston</A>&gt; If you don't want to
give your real name that's fine.. But, RSVP anyway.

It is our goal to provide you with excellent presentations on application
security topics that interest you. At this time we feel that quarterly
formal meetings with at least two presenters is an attainable goal. We are
working to secure some top notch speakers. For instance, one of our early
confirmed speakers for February is Jason Chan from Netflix. Jason will
speak about Netflix's approach to application security with tools like
Simian Army, Security Monkey and Gauntlt which are all designed to wreak
havoc on your applications and infrastructure.

For our monthly meetings you should expect an informal hands-on
environment. We may be having crowd-sourced lightning talks, bug hunting,
workshops, training, CTF, lock picking contests, etc. Whatever it is it'll
be fun and you should learn something.

You can read more on the chapter page.

Join us!

When: November 19th, 2012 (6PM - 8PM)
Where: Stag's Head Pub - 2128 Portsmouth Street Houston, TX 77098
Sponsored By: Imperva and Alert Logic

We are still considering a few locations for the quarterly and monthly
meeting space. If you have a suggestion please reply to me directly.

Thank you for your support,

OWASP Houston
