I would love to talk with you and others you recommend about speaking at one of our events.  Please call me at 832.858.9205.

If you don't mind, I am available and would like to attend your Nov. 19 meeting.  Please let me know.  

Also, I plan to go to ISSA today, and look forward to meeting you if you plan to be there also.

Sincerely,

Harvey Nusz, CISSP, CISA, CRISC

Paul,
 
Thanks for the invite. Unfortunately, I won&#8217;t be able to attend as I teach on Monday nights at UH. As President of the Greater Houston Chapter of ISACA, I think it may good to have you speak at one of our luncheons in 2013. Let me know if you would have interest.
 
Regards,

The wait is over! OWASP Houston is here!  We will have an informal kick-off meeting 6PM-8PM on Monday, November 19th at Stag's Head Pub in their private meeting room. This is just two weeks away. Please join us to help shape OWASP Houston before you leave for the holidays. 

When: November 19th, 2012 (6PM - 8PM)
Where: Stag's Head Pub - 2128 Portsmouth Street Houston, TX 77098
Sponsored By: Imperva and Alert Logic

The goal of this kick-off is to meet local security professionals and make decisions regarding the OWASP Houston 2013 series of meetings. Please take a moment to complete this five question survey. We will be announcing aggregate results at the meeting and try to make a decision for a quarterly meeting space.  

Five question survey

If you can make it to the meeting, great. Please RSVP on our meetup page so we can have some expectation of attendance. Food and drinks are courtesy of our sponsors for the evening, Imperva and Alert Logic. Many thanks to both organizations for taking a chance sponsoring a new chapter.

RSVP at meetup.com If you don't want to give your real name that's fine.. But, RSVP anyway.

It is our goal to provide you with excellent presentations on application security topics that interest you. At this time we feel that quarterly formal meetings with at least two presenters is an attainable goal. We are working to secure some top notch speakers. For instance, one of our early confirmed speakers for February is Jason Chan from Netflix. Jason will speak about Netflix's approach to application security with tools like Simian Army, Security Monkey and Gauntlt which are all designed to wreak havoc on your applications and infrastructure.  

For our monthly meetings you should expect an informal hands-on environment. We may be having crowd-sourced lightning talks, bug hunting, workshops, training, CTF, lock picking contests, etc. Whatever it is it'll be fun and you should learn something.

You can read more on the chapter page.

We are still considering a few locations for the quarterly and monthly meeting space. If you have a suggestion please reply to me directly.

Thank you for your support,

OWASP Houston
