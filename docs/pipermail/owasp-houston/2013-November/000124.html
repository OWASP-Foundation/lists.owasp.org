<PRE>Greetings Houston,

We have some great news! We have a secured two new sponsors for the
November Mini-Con. Thank you HP and Accuvant! Since our budget for the
event has grown we've decided to release 10 additional tickets (guaranteed
seat and adult beverages). There were already a few guests on the wait list
for the event that will be granted tickets. Congrats. This leaves only a
handful of tickets remaining. Please tell a friend or co-worker to sign up
quickly!

Additionally, there has been an update to the description of Jonathan
Kuskos' presentation that more accurately reflects his talk. I wrote an
original summary based on a brief email conversation and it was inaccurate.
The description has been updated to correctly read, &quot;Johnathan Kuskos will
be presenting methods of WAF bypassing, breaking client-side validation,
and advanced injection obsfucation.&quot; Not just advanced SQL injection
obsfucation! Sorry for the confusion.

Houston's response to the OWASP chapter and particularly this event has
been great. We are now the the sixth largest OWASP chapter using Meetup.
Based on our trending we will soon pass Raleigh and Orange County and take
the fourth spot. This increased interest means that we will need to
considering larger event space for the 2014 Mini-Con series.

See you Thursday!

Reserve your free ticket on
