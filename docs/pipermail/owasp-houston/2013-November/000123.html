<PRE>Greetings Houston,

The last tickets for the November Mini-Con were claimed on Eventbrite this
morning, but we've just released five more tickets. The event details have
been updated to include a description of Johnathan Kuskos' presentation.

Thanks,

OWASP Houston



Please join us on November 14th for the fourth installment of OWASP
Houston's 2013 Mini-Con series. Seating and drinks are reserved for guests
that have signed up through eventbrite. If there are no tickets available,
a wait list will for a seat will be opened. If you do not have a ticket and
would like to come, please come to the event early. Limited standing room
will be available.

Reception begins at 6:00PM. Our speakers at this event included Jason
Reeder, Johnathan Kuskos, and Daniel Buentello. Jason will starting the
evening with our first presentation at 6:30PM. The event will be finished
by 9:00PM.

This will be the last meeting of 2013. Thank you for all your support.  We
are currently planning the 2014 year.

To find out about future events, sign up for our meetup
group.&lt;<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Houston/">http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Houston/</A>&gt;

Johnathan Kuskos will be presenting methods of WAF bypassing, breaking
client-side validation, and advanced SQL injection obsfucation.

The first bandaid that web app administrators typically apply to their site
is a web application firewall.  Most lack the technical skill set to tune
it properly, or leave default settings &quot;as is&quot;.  Whitelists can be
difficult to customize appropriately and blacklists usually fall prey to
persistent attackers.  Spoiler alert: All WAF's can be bypassed.  This
becomes even more devastating when the WAF is the only line of defense.
 This presentation will focus on injection obfuscation, and include a few
cool tricks for bypassing pesky WAF blacklists and filters that I've come
across on my journey to become a more thorough penetration tester.

  Kuskos is a Senior Application Security Engineer and newly appointed
Security Check Supervisor for WhiteHat Security.  He has a bad habit of
going home and hacking after he's done hacking at his day job.  As an
active participant in responsible disclosure, he can be found on publicly
recognized &quot;Whitehat&quot; lists for Shopify, Twitter, Mozilla, Netflix, Google,
Meraki, LastPass, Barracuda Networks, and Etsy.

Additionally, Daniel Buentello will be presenting his Derby Con 2013 talk
titled, &quot;Weaponizing your Coffee Pot&quot;:

As SoC price continue to drop and their implementation continues to rise,
connected &#8220;&#8221;appliances&#8221;&quot; (Internet of Things)will be become an attractive
avenue for cyber criminals. Due to the fact they provide no traditional
feedback (monitor) or input (mouse/keyboard) If one were able to compromise
an embedded host it would be the perfect vantage point for a MITM attack or
a beachhead to launch other attacks. I plan to guide you through some of
the steps from initial reconnaissance to building binaries for different
architectures. Then end goal being to take over the host without breaking
designed functionality (stealthy), being able to run third party binaries
at start (lethal), and surviving basic removal techniques (persistent) aka
weaponizing.

*FAQs*

*What are my parking options ?*

Parking is freely available in the garage behind the hotel. We will be
validating parking at registration. This benefit applies to everyone that
attends the event regardless of your ticket holding status.



*Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?*

You don't have to bring your ticket, but it might help speed up things. We
can verify the name you register with.



*The name on the registration/ticket doesn't match the attendee. Is that
okay?*

If you can't make it and want to print your ticket for a friend that can,
that's fine.
