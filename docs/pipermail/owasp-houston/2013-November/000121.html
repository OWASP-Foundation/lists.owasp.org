evening with our first presentation at 6:30PM. The event will be finished
by 9:00PM.

This will be the last meeting of 2013. Thank you for all your support.  We
are currently planning the 2014 year.

To find out about future events, sign up for our meetup
group.&lt;<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Houston/">http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Houston/</A>&gt;

Johnathan Kuskos will be presenting methods of WAF bypassing, breaking
client-side validation, and advanced SQL injection obsfucation.


Daniel Buentello will be presenting his Derby Con 2013 talk titled,
&quot;Weaponizing
your Coffee Pot&quot;:

As SoC price continue to drop and their implementation continues to rise,
connected &#8220;&#8221;appliances&#8221;&quot; (Internet of Things)will be become an attractive
avenue for cyber criminals. Due to the fact they provide no traditional
feedback (monitor) or input (mouse/keyboard) If one were able to compromise
an embedded host it would be the perfect vantage point for a MITM attack or
a beachhead to launch other attacks. I plan to guide you through some of
the steps from initial reconnaissance to building binaries for different
architectures. Then end goal being to take over the host without breaking
designed functionality (stealthy), being able to run third party binaries
at start (lethal), and surviving basic removal techniques (persistent) aka
weaponizing.
