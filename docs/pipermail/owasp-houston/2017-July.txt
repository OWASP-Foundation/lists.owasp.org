OWASP Houston July Chapter Meeting

Tuesday July, 18 2017 at 6:30PM

Title: Making Vulnerability Management Less Painful with OWASP DefectDojo

OWASP DefectDojo Project
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_DefectDojo_Project


Abstract:

DefectDojo was created in 2013 when one security engineer at Rackspace
stupidly opened his mouth in front of his leadership team. Vulnerability
management is traditionally tedious, time consuming, and mentally draining.
DefectDojo attempts to streamline vulnerability management with automation
centered around templating, report generation, metrics, scanner
consolidation, and baseline self-service tools. DefectDojo is currently
used by multiple large enterprises and has core contributors from five
different companies. It has made several engineers' lives much easier, and
it can help you too. Got a ton of findings to consolidate and report on?
DefectDojo has you covered. Need to have a dashboard of your team?s work?
DefectDojo has you covered. Tired of boilerplate report generation?
DefectDojo does that for you. Come check out how to make vulnerability
management less painful and speed up your appsec program in this talk with
demo.


Speaker:

Greg Anderson is the project leader for OWASP DefectDojo. He will be
presenting remotely and the room works well for this format. Greg is a long
time member of OWASP and has held several different leadership positions.
You can find his bio on the official OWASP users page:

Greg Anderson did a great job talking about OWASP DefectDojo and how it has
drastically improved the value that he provides to his development and
management teams. There are many opportunities to contribute in various
roles helping make this project even better. Since documentation is key,
the project has placed a huge emphasis making it solid.

He also reminded us that all OWASP members should participate in the
upcoming elections. It is extremely important to actively participate in
this process. You need to be an OWASP member in order to vote. Full details
can be found below.

We also discussed possible future topics such as Python programming since
it is becoming crucial to various security tools like DefectDojo.
