Houston OWASP,

HouSecCon 2012 is coming, and the committee is completely psyched about it!
Honestly, it is hard not to be excited about the third year of HouSecCon.
HouSecCon 2010 was packed full of great sessions with some serious power
players in the InfoSec industry presenting. We packed 180+ attendees into
the Houston Microsoft offices that first year, and the positive feedback
was overwhelming.

HouSecCon 2011 held some big changes. We knew the Microsoft offices would
not be able to hold us, so we moved venues to the Norris Conference
Center?s beautiful CityCentre location. We had more awesome sessions, with
presenters and attendees coming from all over the US to speak and attend.
Our attendance grew to over 250.

And this year? Well, HouSecCon 2012 is expected to grow to close to 300,
and we?re hoping to go over that by quite a bit. A ticket for the event is
still only $25. Also, we have introduced a VIP ticket for $50 (limit of 50
tickets, so jump on them quickly), where you will be guaranteed a t-shirt
and other perks (to be announced). You just can?t get this kind of quality
InfoSec learning and access to a bunch of great sponsors anywhere for that
kind of money!
