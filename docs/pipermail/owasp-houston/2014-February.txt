Subject: [Owasp-Houston] OWASP Houston Workshop: Intro to Metasploit
	February 20th 2014
Message-ID: <CAC-yGhmXKPi3bAQWe4-_CwfQujDux1GXoeNr7SuwVM3O2Rt4tQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

We have a new venue sponsored by TXRX Labs <http://txrxlabs.org>. If you
haven't been to TXRX labs, it's a 16,000-square-foot hacker space on the
east side of downtown. They provide educational classes like Intro to
LinuxCNC <http://txrxlabs.org/classes/intro-to-linuxcnc-fall-2013_172/> and
host recreational programming
events.<http://txrxlabs.org/event/348/recreational-computer-programming-group/>They
also have classes on knitting, welding,  soldering, bicycle repair,
and pancakes. This is a great space for learning in Houston and that's why
we're exploring its use for OWASP workshops.

Our first Workshop topic for 2014 will be an introduction to Metasploit led
by Dennis Maldonado(@DennisMald) You are encouraged to bring a laptop to
follow along with the presentation, test out the concepts, and ask
questions.
