<PRE>

The Houston TechFest 2008 will be held on Saturday, September 13th at the
 University of Houston's main campus. 
We learned a lot from last years' TechFest where almost 500 people attended.
We believe TechFest 2008 will be even better.

We would like to extend an invitation to all speakers interested in making a presentation at this event.  
Acceptable topics include .NET, Security, Java, SharePoint, development
 methodologies, SQL Server or related technologies.

Requirements for Presentations: 

&#168;    60 minutes in length maximum. We may include a limited number of longer sessions.

&#168;    Submission of the presenter's name along with a short abstract. Follow up with a picture (optional), and bio.

&#168;    Send us your shirt size.

Speakers may submit more than one topic for presentation.  Please send
 all topic(s), presenter(s), bio(s), and abstract(s) to
 <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-houston">speakers at houstontechfest.com.</A> 

There will be 5 sessions with multiple tracks in each session.  

Feel free to pass this information to other people who might want to be presenters at the Houston TechFest.

If you or your organization would like to be a sponsor please request sponsor information from <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-houston">sponsors at houstontechfest.com</A>

Should you have any questions, please contact me at
 <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-houston">speakers at houstontechfest.com.</A> 

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,

Michael Steinberg
Houston TechFest
