SharePoint Auditing and Penetration Testing by Shohn Tojacek
*
Gartner predicts SharePoint will eventually replace network file shares.
This makes sense due to the feature-rich environment, ease of use, and
collaborative benefits.  However, the default security model allows for all
site users to have read access to all documents.  Further, Microsoft gives
you base functionality in Windows Server using Windows SharePoint Services
(WSS); but to really leverage SharePoint you probably want to use Microsoft
Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) that allows for integration with MS Office
documents.  Now you have all your company's documents in a single repository
that has functionality that can enable different teams to 'build' their own
portal and apply their own security model.

In this talk we will explore the possibilities of SharePoint and the
security implications for your business and how you might address them.
