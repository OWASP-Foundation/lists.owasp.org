<PRE>OWASP Houston -

Thank you to everyone who participated in the initial OWASP Houston
Re-Launch in November.  The turnout was great and will continue to to
only get better as we all grow this chapter together.  We hope
everyone has a great holiday in the upcoming weeks.  This email is to
inform you of a planned meeting for OWASP Houston after the holiday
season cools down.  With that in mind, please join us on Thursday,
January 31st for an OWASP Houston Workshop.  During this workshop,
attendees will be led through the process of discovering and reporting
vulnerabilities.  We will start by reviewing source code for common
vulnerabilities.  Once we identify interesting code, we will test the
application to confirm our initial findings.  Finally, we will discuss
reporting elements.  Please bring your laptop if you plan on
participating.  Spin up and prepare a virtual machine with Linux,
Apache, MySQL, and PHP.  If you just want to watch and learn; that's a
fine choice as well.  Looking forward to another successful meeting
with you all.  Feel free to invite friends and colleagues interested
in infosec and OWASP.

Sponsors: Imperva and Alert Logic
Please join us 6PM Thursday January 31st at Stag's Head.
