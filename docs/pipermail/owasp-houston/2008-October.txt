Subject: [Owasp-houston] Call for Logos - SnowFROC
Message-ID: <276614.92896.qm@web406.biz.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi All - we're putting together a Front-Range OWASP Conference for March 5th.  We're calling it
SnowFROC and we're hoping to make it a fantastic annual event.

A fantastic event needs a fantastic logo.  Please help by creating a logo and sending a jpeg to
Kathy Thaxton at kthaxton at businesspartnersolutions and to me at owasp at justplainpix.com with a
subject line "Logo contest" and your contact info.  If you're not "the artistic type" but you know
someone who is, please forward this message on.

Here are some examples.  I'd REALLY like to have something of the same quality - please help!

What does the winner get?  At this point I can guarantee that the winner will be recognized during
SnowFROC as well as on the SnowFROC site and both Chapter websites.  I can promise we'll try to do
something else special for the winner but can't guarantee what that will be (stay tuned).

Note:  if you are interested in volunteering to be on the Panel of Judges please contact me or
Kathy Thaxton (Events Director, cc:'d on this message)

Thanks and good luck!
Andy
