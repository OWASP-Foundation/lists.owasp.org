<PRE>OWASP Team,

In an effort to provide our members with new and interesting products - Core Security is offering our chapter a five day trial of their new Web Application Security Testing product, WebVerify.  See below for details.  

If you do decide to try/test the solution,...it will be going through their normal sales channels (so you will be contacted (i'm assuming) by an account executive).  However, i wanted to extend the offer to you since it's a (newer) solution to the marketplace.

Have a great weekend!

David




-----------------------


WebVerify is an automated security testing product that provides demonstrable and actionable intelligence on an organization&#8217;s exploitable web application vulnerabilities and the resulting security implications for their broader operations&#8211; using techniques similar to those employed by actual attackers. With WebVerify, you can not only identify exploitable application weaknesses, but also verify the exposure of related databases, the web server, backend network devices, and even end users against subsequent attacks.  The license they are providing us is a 5 day trial of the WebVerify product.  If you would like to take advantage of this opportunity simply register by visiting this page:
