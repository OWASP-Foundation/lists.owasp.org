Subject: [Owasp-Houston] Who is headed to AppSec 2009 in DC?

All:

Who all is headed to AppSec 2009 in Washington DC next week?  There is still time to register: <http://appsecdc.org/>

I wanted to get an idea of who from the Texas crew was headed to DC.  We should meet up at the Thursday happy hour.  I'll buy the first round :)

Hope folks can make it.  This is shaping up to be a great conference.

Thanks,

Dan

Subject: [Owasp-Houston] NAISG :: December Meeting (Wireless Hacking
	Demonstration)
Message-ID: <75ca934b0911180837u6c6f86d0ue6a07c9b0c7ff86a@mail.gmail.com>

All,

While OWASP Houston is not hosting any meetings until February 2010, I
wanted to forward on an invitation for NAISG's December meeting.  If
you are interested, the meeting information is viewable at:

http://houston.naisg.org/Meetings.asp

I would say - the presenter, Kent Woodruff (Motorola / AirDefense), is
an exceptional presenter and demonstrates a few outstanding hacks for
wireless.  So...if hacking is your bag...you would really enjoy this
presentation!

Enjoy!

David
