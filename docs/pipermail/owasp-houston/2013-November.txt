Johnathan Kuskos will be presenting methods of WAF bypassing, breaking
client-side validation, and advanced SQL injection obsfucation.


Daniel Buentello will be presenting his Derby Con 2013 talk titled,
"Weaponizing
your Coffee Pot":

As SoC price continue to drop and their implementation continues to rise,
connected ??appliances?" (Internet of Things)will be become an attractive
avenue for cyber criminals. Due to the fact they provide no traditional
feedback (monitor) or input (mouse/keyboard) If one were able to compromise
an embedded host it would be the perfect vantage point for a MITM attack or
a beachhead to launch other attacks. I plan to guide you through some of
the steps from initial reconnaissance to building binaries for different
architectures. Then end goal being to take over the host without breaking
designed functionality (stealthy), being able to run third party binaries
at start (lethal), and surviving basic removal techniques (persistent) aka
weaponizing.

Johnathan Kuskos will be presenting methods of WAF bypassing, breaking
client-side validation, and advanced SQL injection obsfucation.

The first bandaid that web app administrators typically apply to their site
is a web application firewall.  Most lack the technical skill set to tune
it properly, or leave default settings "as is".  Whitelists can be
difficult to customize appropriately and blacklists usually fall prey to
persistent attackers.  Spoiler alert: All WAF's can be bypassed.  This
becomes even more devastating when the WAF is the only line of defense.
 This presentation will focus on injection obfuscation, and include a few
cool tricks for bypassing pesky WAF blacklists and filters that I've come
across on my journey to become a more thorough penetration tester.

  Kuskos is a Senior Application Security Engineer and newly appointed
Security Check Supervisor for WhiteHat Security.  He has a bad habit of
going home and hacking after he's done hacking at his day job.  As an
active participant in responsible disclosure, he can be found on publicly
recognized "Whitehat" lists for Shopify, Twitter, Mozilla, Netflix, Google,
Meraki, LastPass, Barracuda Networks, and Etsy.

Additionally, Daniel Buentello will be presenting his Derby Con 2013 talk
titled, "Weaponizing your Coffee Pot":

connected ??appliances?" (Internet of Things)will be become an attractive

*FAQs*

*What are my parking options ?*

Parking is freely available in the garage behind the hotel. We will be
validating parking at registration. This benefit applies to everyone that
attends the event regardless of your ticket holding status.



*Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?*

You don't have to bring your ticket, but it might help speed up things. We
can verify the name you register with.



*The name on the registration/ticket doesn't match the attendee. Is that
okay?*

If you can't make it and want to print your ticket for a friend that can,
that's fine.

Subject: [Owasp-Houston] November Mini-Con Event Update! New sponsor first
	time sponsor!
Message-ID: <CAC-yGhkAVE_S40F-hibtA2QS6b4U5joyB4EiCsyeJRTu4NNk8A@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings Houston,

We have some great news! We have a secured two new sponsors for the
November Mini-Con. Thank you HP and Accuvant! Since our budget for the
event has grown we've decided to release 10 additional tickets (guaranteed
seat and adult beverages). There were already a few guests on the wait list
for the event that will be granted tickets. Congrats. This leaves only a
handful of tickets remaining. Please tell a friend or co-worker to sign up
quickly!

Additionally, there has been an update to the description of Jonathan
Kuskos' presentation that more accurately reflects his talk. I wrote an
original summary based on a brief email conversation and it was inaccurate.
The description has been updated to correctly read, "Johnathan Kuskos will
be presenting methods of WAF bypassing, breaking client-side validation,
and advanced injection obsfucation." Not just advanced SQL injection
obsfucation! Sorry for the confusion.

Houston's response to the OWASP chapter and particularly this event has
been great. We are now the the sixth largest OWASP chapter using Meetup.
Based on our trending we will soon pass Raleigh and Orange County and take
the fourth spot. This increased interest means that we will need to
considering larger event space for the 2014 Mini-Con series.

See you Thursday!

Reserve your free ticket on
Eventbrite<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-houston-november-mini-con-tickets-7644379545>

Thanks,
