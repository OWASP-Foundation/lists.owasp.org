<PRE>*Revisiting Application Security Controls - May 12, 2010*

The application security domain has existed for quite a while now; however
we are still struggling to fill in the fundamental security gaps in the
software implementations. Take for example: we spend enormous effort and
time to enforce basic input/output validations so to fortify the
applications' security. The area that we need to focus on is to educate and
train the developers to integrate security controls in the development phase
of an application, rather than developing the application with the
traditional methods and then testing &amp; patching the application. If we
integrate the security controls in the first place, it would drastically
reduce cost, effort and time. The presentation by Gunwant Singh will shed
light on the basic controls that developers can incorporate into the
applications for a better security posture. Also, he will elucidate on how
and where exactly one can use input/output validations appropriately in web
applications.

Gunwant Singh is currently working with SAIC India Private Limited as
Information Security Analyst II. At SAIC, he is working for a Fortune 100
MNC to audit their web applications and servers for its global application
security group. Prior to SAIC, he worked as a freelancer providing services
to a number of firms. He has done extensive research on Honeypots and
collated enormous data on web servers like IIS, Apache and Zeus. As a
security consultant he has spoken at National Informatics Center, India and
audited a number of government web applications for them. He is actively
engaged in OWASP Delhi Chapter and has hosted several training sessions and
presentations for them.
