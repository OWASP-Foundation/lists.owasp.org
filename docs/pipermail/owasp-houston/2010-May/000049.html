Revisiting Application Security Controls - May 12, 2010

The application security domain has existed for quite a while now; however we are still struggling to fill in the fundamental security gaps in the software implementations. Take for example: we spend enormous effort and time to enforce basic input/output validations so to fortify the applications' security. The area that we need to focus on is to educate and train the developers to integrate security controls in the development phase of an application, rather than developing the application with the traditional methods and then testing &amp; patching the application. If we integrate the security controls in the first place, it would drastically reduce cost, effort and time. The presentation by Gunwant Singh will shed light on the basic controls that developers can incorporate into the applications for a better security posture. Also, he will elucidate on how and where exactly one can use input/output validations appropriately in web applications.

Gunwant Singh is currently working with SAIC India Private Limited as Information Security Analyst II. At SAIC, he is working for a Fortune 100 MNC to audit their web applications and servers for its global application security group. Prior to SAIC, he worked as a freelancer providing services to a number of firms. He has done extensive research on Honeypots and collated enormous data on web servers like IIS, Apache and Zeus. As a security consultant he has spoken at National Informatics Center, India and audited a number of government web applications for them. He is actively engaged in OWASP Delhi Chapter and has hosted several training sessions and presentations for them.


Date, Time and Location:

Wednesday, May 12, 2010 from 6 PM to 8 PM
Houston Community College (HCC)
1010 West Sam Houston Parkway North
