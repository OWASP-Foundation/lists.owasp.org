Message-ID: <CAFwvDezY1=B7xJ-xp4z+wOgm6MGVxSNXQ_g_S6RfPyHANUxQtA@mail.gmail.com>

Have you ever dreamed of presenting at a major security conference alongside
luminaries such as Jeremiah Grossman, Gene Kim, and Michael Howard?  Or
maybe you're a seasoned veteran looking to present at a conference that
treats its speakers with the utmost respect and admiration?  Whether you're
a n00b on the speaking circuit or a semi-professional speaker, the Lonestar
Application Security Conference wants you to submit to our Call For Papers!
LASCON is a non-profit OWASP Conference which takes place on Friday, October
28, 2011 at the Norris Conference Center in Austin, TX.  This year's
conference will have a least four tracks focused on Audit, Architecture,
Development, and Executive Management with the possibility of adding a fifth
track if the submissions warrant it.  The CFP process is simple.  Just go to
the link below and submit a presentation title and abstract before 12 PM CST
on Friday, August 19th.  We anticipate having our full list of
speakers selected before the end of August.  Please submit your LASCON CFP
today!
