OWASP Houston May Chapter Meeting
Tuesday May 23, 2017 at 6:00PM

Title:
Using Instrumentation and Sensors to drive Optimization in your Application
Security Program

Location:
Lucky?s Pub Downtown
801 St Emanuel Street,
Houston, TX 77003
http://luckyspub.com/locations/downtown/

Abstract:
In our physical world, we have instrumentation all around us. Clocks tell
us time, kitchen ovens tell us temperature, and apps remind us to take our
medication. Cars tell us speed, fuel level and even have onboard health
diagnostics. In our homes, we have security alerts when someone trespasses
our property or opens a door. However, in the world of software, we have
very little visibility into what is going on inside the software. Our
presenters will describe how instrumentation can be used to enable your
software applications to both detect vulnerabilities and block attacks.
Furthermore, they will demonstrate the insights offered by using
instrumentation and why this approach can offer unique insights to your
security program.
