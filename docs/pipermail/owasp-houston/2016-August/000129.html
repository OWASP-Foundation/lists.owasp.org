<PRE>Last night Roger did a great job giving us the basics of Docker containers.
People asked about the Houston Docker meetup and it is actually tonight. We
also had questions about creating your own private repositories. That just
happens to be the topic for tonight's meetup. If you are interested in
attending the Docker Houston Meetup, please use the invite below to
register.

<A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Houston/events/232245343/">https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Houston/events/232245343/</A>

The talk is titled *&quot;Docker Private Registry: How To&quot;* and more information
is below.

The Iron Yard
4203 Montrose, suite 100, Houston, TX

Synopsis:

&#8226; Typically, once a Docker image is created, it is stored in a registry for
easy distribution.

&#8226; DockerHub provides a convenient location for images available to
everyone. Yet in many cases, it is important to have the option to store
images privately.

&#8226; DockerHub offers this service for a fee, but what if paying an extra fee
is not an option?

&#8226; What if your project is small with little or no funding?

&#8226; Do you want to your images available for everyone to download? Probably
not. Thankfully, there is another way.

&#8226; Come and learn how to setup and run your own registry.

&#8220;Docker Private Registry: How To&#8221;

will walk you through setting up a registry just for your projects.
