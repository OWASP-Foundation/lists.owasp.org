*Catching Flies with Mr Miyagi: Web Application Testing Techniques by Kevin
Johnson*

In this talk based loosely around the Karate kid movies, Kevin John (CEO of
Secure Ideas) will walk through some techniques to improve your web
penetration testing techniques.  Stop being the kid moved from NJ and
dropped into a cruddy apartment.  Learn the wax on/off of testing modern
web applications.

Kevin has performed a large number of trainings, briefings, and
presentations for both public events and internal trainings. Kevin teaches
for the SANS Institute on a number of subjects. He is the author of three
classes- SEC542: Web Application Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking,
SEC642: Advanced Web Application Penetration Testing, and SEC571: Mobile
Device Security. Kevin has presented at a large number of conventions,
meetings, and industry events. Some examples of these are: DerbyCon,
ShmooCon, DEFCON, Blackhat, ISACA, Infragard, and ISSA.

*WTF, WAF Testing Framework by Terry Ray*

Terry Ray will be presenting an approach to evaluating web application
firewall capabilities that is suitable to the real world use case. The
methodology touches on issues like False Positive / False Negative rates,
evasion techniques and white listing / black listing balance. He will
demonstrate a tool that can be used by organizations to implement the
methodology either when choosing an application protection solution or
after deployment.

    OWASP Austin April Chapter Meeting - CSP to the Rescue - Neil
    Matatall, Twitter

*Please RSVP at the link below so we can plan for food. By doing this,
you will also be signed up for our monthly drawings!*

*When:* Tuesday, April 30th, from 11:30am - 1:00pm

*Where:* National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

*Topic:*CSP to the Rescue

Abstract: CSP to the rescue XSS is still very much an unsolved problem.
Browser quirks, contextual mismatches, and programmer error can be
attributed to 100% of stored/reflected XSS. It is a problem we have been
battling for almost 20 years. Even with input validation and output
encoding, how can we be certain that we will never execute unintended
Javascript? CSP. Implementing CSP to provably disable cross-site
scripting isn't trivial, but I propose that anyone can do it. During
this presentation we'll look at how the spec accomplishes its goal,
recommendations for implementing its application, lessons learned, and
tools that support the application of CSP.


*Speaker:* Neil Matatall, Twitter

Neil is a security engineer for Twitter. He focuses on integrating
security technologies into the software development stack at all levels.
He would prefer to grow a powerful neckbeard and code in the dark, but
sometimes life gets in the way. He has been involved with OWASP since
2008 and had lead the OWASP OC chapter and has contributed to many open
source projects.
