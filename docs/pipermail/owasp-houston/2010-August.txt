	2010 is Coming!

Hey Houston OWASPers!

On October 29, 2010 the Austin OWASP chapter will be putting on the
first-ever OWASP Regional Conference in Texas!  Sponsorships and CFP
submissions continue to roll in on an almost daily basis and we are getting
super excited about giving you what will soon become the best application
security conference in the state for the absolute least amount of money
possible.  Here's just a sample of people who have already submitted to
speak at our conference:


   - Robert Hansen (CEO of SecTheory, LLC)
   - Chris Eng (Senior Director of Security Research, Veracode)
   - Dan Cornell (Principal, Denim Group)
   - Joe Jarzombek (Director for Software Assurance, Global Cyber Security
   Management, National Cyber Security Division, Department of Homeland
   Security)
   - Samy Kamkar (Yeah, the "MySpace Worm" Samy)


So here's the deal....conference attendance will be severely restricted due
to space at the Norris Conference Center.  We've got room for about 200
attendees and once those seats are sold, you won't be able to buy, beg, or
cheat your way into the conference.  The good news is that we are proud to
make this the single most affordable conference that I've ever heard of.
You get a full day of sessions from a literal "Who's Who" of the security
industry for a mere $50 if you're already an OWASP member or $100 if you're
not and that includes membership!  So what are you waiting for?  We're
giving the OWASP chapters first shot at buying conference passes before we
begin advertising this out to everyone else, but we can only wait a couple
days.  After that, well, there's no telling how much longer we'll have
available passes.  Register with the following link:

If you are interested in presenting at the conference, the CFP is open
through the end of August.  Submit your papers here:

If you or your company is interested in sponsoring this awesome event, we
still have a bunch of options for you.  Check out our sponsorship page here:


http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Lonestar_Application_Security_Conference_2010#tab=Sponsors

So there you have it folks...the first-ever OWASP Conference in Texas will
be in Austin on October 29, 2010.  With quality presenters, affordable
passes, and an awesome location, you can't go wrong.  Get your pass while
they last!

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol (CISSP, CCNA, GWAS)
President
Austin OWASP
