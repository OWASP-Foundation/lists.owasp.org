<PRE>Greetings,

This is a reminder about our secure code review workshop that is scheduled
for 6PM this Thursday at Stag's Head. Space will be limited for this event,
so get there early. If you intend on participating, make sure your laptop
is charged.

We have decided to focus the code review session on three open source
applications. These applications are not known to have vulnerabilities.
Please download and install these before the event. If you have some
problems with install, we will have some time from 6:00PM-6:30PM to help.
Attendees are encourage to
RSVP&lt;<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Houston/events/95725772/">http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Houston/events/95725772/</A>&gt;.
Applications being reviewed include...

&#167;  phplist-2.10.19.tgz&lt;<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplist/?source=directory">http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplist/?source=directory</A>&gt;
*&quot;phpList is the world's most popular opensource email campaign manager.&quot;*

&#167;  xoops-2.5.5.zip &lt;<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xoops/?source=directory">http://sourceforge.net/projects/xoops/?source=directory</A>&gt;
*&quot;XOOPS is one of world's leading open source CMS and portal systems,
written in PHP for the MySQL database. Its object orientation makes it an
ideal tool for developing small or large community websites, intra company
and corporate portals, weblogs and much more.&quot;*

&#167;  Open_Source_Point_of_Sale_2.0.zip&lt;<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensourcepos/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensourcepos/</A>&gt;
*&quot;Open Source Point of Sale is a web based point of sale system written in
the PHP language. It uses MySQL as the data storage back-end and has a
simple user interface.&quot;*

These were the most recent versions of the application available when we
planned the session. Please download and install this version, so we are
all working with the same application. It's advised that, until we have
checked out the source code of these applications, the webserver on your VM
only listen on a loopback address.

*Please join us 6PM Thursday January 31st at Stag's Head. *
