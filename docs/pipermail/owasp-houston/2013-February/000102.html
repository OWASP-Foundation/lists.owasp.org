<PRE>Greetings,

We had a great turn out and an excellent response from our attendees,
speakers, and sponsors. The Westin was a great venue, but we will
definitely need to investigate getting more space for our next Mini-Con on
May 16th. I've already got some confirmed speakers. And, it's going to be
good.

Jason Chan has made his slides from the talk available. I know there were a
few people specifically looking for the reference slides. Enjoy.

Cloud Application Security: Lessons Learned (Presented at the Houston OWASP
meeting - 2/21/2013 by Jason Chan - <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-houston">chan at netflix.com</A>)

I've received a few requests for MJ Keith's slides. Once he has posted or
emailed the final deck to me, I will send out a link.

Please RSVP for our happy hour meeting at Stag's head Thursday March 14th.
Full details are available at meetup.com. You don't have to provide your
name to RSVP.

If you have an active OWASP Membership registered to the Houston Chapter in

limited-run of shirts was designed and printed locally on a comfortable
tee. For additional member benefits see the link below.
