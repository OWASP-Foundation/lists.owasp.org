The meeting is titled "*What's in your program?  Application Security
Maturity in 2012*" and is being presented by Joel Scambray (Cigital).  For
additional information/summary on the meeting topic, please refer to:

It is important to register for the event so that we may plan meeting

I just found the OWASP Appsec Tutorial Series<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Appsec_Tutorial_Series>.
Very well done.  Is the some way to be notified when new episodes are published?

Thanks,
