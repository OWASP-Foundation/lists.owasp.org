OWASP Houston September Chapter Meeting
Monday September 19, 2016 at 6:30PM

Title: Web App Testing Stats Compared to The OWASP Top 10

Description:

For over seven years, Cigital has performed high volumes of application
security assessments through the Cigital Assessment Center (CAC). Over that
time the CAC has accumulated a large amount of data that provides helpful
insights into software security practices. We?ll present the most common
web application security vulnerabilities identified over one year by the
CAC, contrasting our findings with one of the industry?s leading
benchmarks, the OWASP Top 10.

Bio:

Joel Scambray is a Principal at Cigital, a leading software security
consulting firm established in 1992. He has helped Fortune 500-class
organizations address information security challenges for over twenty years
as a consultant, author and speaker, business leader, and entrepreneur. He
is widely recognized as co-author of the Hacking Exposed book series, and
has worked/consulted for companies including Microsoft, Foundstone, Amazon,
Costco, Softcard, and Ernst & Young.

Building security requires the list of attendees with their full names by
the Friday prior to the meeting, so please signup by the Thursday before
the meeting.

OWASP Houston October Chapter Meeting

Monday October 17, 2016 at 6:30PM

Title: Is Your Vulnerability Management Program Evolving? Introducing the
Vulnerability Management Maturity Model ? VM3

Speaker: Gordon MacKay

Presentation Abstract:

Vulnerability management (VM) solutions and products that are central to
every information security program contain a serious ?hidden? flaw. This
software flaw is interleaved within pattern matching-like algorithms
located deep within the foundational core of the most widely used automated
VM solutions on the market. As a direct consequence of this flaw, even
though these products report a certain level of network security risk, the
metric upon which their calculations are based is skewed, resulting in an
unintentional gap between the products? intended information risk
measurement and the erroneous measurement actually reported. This session
covers the technical details of the referred to hidden flaw, its
consequences and what you can do to limit your exposure.

Speaker Bio

Gordon MacKay, CISSP, serves as CTO for Digital Defense, Inc. He applies
mathematical modeling and engineering principles in investigating solutions
to many of the challenges within the information security space. His
solution to matching network discovered hosts within independent
vulnerability assessments across time resulted in achieving patent-pending
status for the company?s scanning technology. MacKay has presented at
numerous security related conferences, including Bsides Austin 2016, BSides
San Antonio 2016, BSides Dallas 2015, RSA 2013, ISC2 San Antonio, ISSA
Houston, ISACA San Antonio, and has been featured by top media outlets such
as CIO Review, FOX Business, Fox News, Softpedia, IT World Canada and
others. He holds a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from McGill
University. He is a Distinguished Ponemon Institute Fellow.


Building security requires the list of attendees with their full names by
the Friday prior to the meeting, so please signup by the Thursday before
the meeting.

Message-ID: <CAN2198SWc6wwXTTVEi3tq1vUUVq=fH36vkxJ8h5zj2MDKMoN3A@mail.gmail.com>

Gordon just reached out to me and told me about how he would like to update
this topic with something even more exciting. He is going to present a
Murder Mystery style discussion to uncover who is killing your InfoSec
program.

You won't want to miss this compelling presentation. We hope to see you
there. The EventBrite and OWASP Chapter pages have been updated with the
new title and abstract.

Please share with your friends and colleagues.

Thanks.

Title: Murder Mystery ? Who is Killing your Information Security Program

Speaker: Gordon MacKay

Presentation Abstract:

Integrating vulnerability scanning results into one?s security ecosystem
involves a serious hidden challenge which results in heinous consequences,
thereby killing your InfoSec program.  This session shares clues on this
challenge, step by step, in the form of a murder mystery game, and
ultimately reveals the culprit as well as strategies to overcome it.  Come
participate, play, and interact! Try to guess ?who-dunnit,? and learn how
to avoid future similar InfoSec crimes.
