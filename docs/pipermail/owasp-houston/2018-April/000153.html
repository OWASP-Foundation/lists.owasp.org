</I>&gt;<i> Presentation Title: A phased approach to building security automation into
</I>&gt;<i> your CI/CD
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Abstract:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So your engineering team is using CI / CD and churning out code at a
</I>&gt;<i> frenetic pace. It is unclear where the risk is, what controls to focus on
</I>&gt;<i> and where in the SDLC to introduce those controls. Mahesh will introduce a
</I>&gt;<i> practical, risk-based approach to introducing security automation into the
</I>&gt;<i> CI / CD pipeline to surface critical issues, shorten remediation time
</I>&gt;<i> without bottlenecking the release. Finally, he will touch on the concepts
</I>&gt;<i> of interactive analysis (IAST) and runtime protection (RASP) as key tools
</I>&gt;<i> in this approach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaker: Mahesh Babu, Head of Product Strategy, Contrast Security
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaker Bio:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mahesh is responsible for growing Contrast Protect. He takes every
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity to tell everyone how Contrast has fundamentally changed
</I>&gt;<i> application security for the first time since he started working in
</I>&gt;<i> security 10+ years ago. Mahesh has seen the industry evolve as a
</I>&gt;<i> researcher, consultant, and practitioner within a large bank. He began his
</I>&gt;<i> career as a security researcher at the CERIAS center at Purdue University.
</I>&gt;<i> He then went on to build and scale large security &amp; privacy programs a
</I>&gt;<i> Senior Manager &amp; architect for HSBC Information Security &amp; Risk. He also
</I>&gt;<i> spent time as a consultant at Deloitte and Booz &amp; Company. Mahesh has a BS
</I>&gt;<i> in Computer Science and MS in Information Security from Purdue University
</I>&gt;<i> and an MBA from Duke University.
