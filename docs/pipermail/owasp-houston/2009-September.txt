Houston OWASP,

Our next chapter meeting will be held on September 9, 2009 at Houston
Community College.  Below are the details for the next meeting, but we will
also be sending out a google calendar invite shortly.  If you are going to
attend the meeting, please be sure to download the parking pass (link

TOPIC: "Conducting Application Assessment"

SPEAKER(S): Dan Cornell, OWASP, Denim Group

ABSTRACT: This talk will review a number of application assessment
techniques and discuss the types of security vulnerabilities they are best
suited to identify as well as how the different approaches can be used in
combination to produce more thorough and insightful results. Code review
will be compared to penetration testing and the capabilities of automated
tools will be compared to manual techniques. In addition, the role of threat
modeling and architecture analysis will be examined. The goal is to
illuminate assessment techniques that go beyond commodity point-and-click
approaches to web application or code scanning.



Date: Wednesday, September 9th
Time: 6:00 - 7:30pm

Location: HCC
1010 West Sam Houston Parkway North
Spring Branch Campus Commons
Houston, TX 77043

--------------------------

Directions: Physically it is Beltway 8 and I-10 -- Take the Gesner Exit of
I-10 from downtown. It is next door to Murphy's Deli.

Parking Pass ( http://owasp.icrew.org/downloads/hccparking.pdf ):  Place on

Subject: [Owasp-Houston] Should I use Admin credentials to run WebInspect
	(or similar product) against a Web application?
Message-ID: <dbe670c70909210726g59b109d3w9ac0c272e8719476@mail.gmail.com>

I usually ask for application admin (not OS admin) credentials from our
developers so we can do our automated web application scans. My thought is
that, like an OS scan with credentials, this gives the best bang for the
buck in exposing as many vulnerabilities within as short a time as possible.
I received this email from one of our Unix admins and wanted to know your
thoughts:

------begin quoted email-------

  I am just curious, why do you need an admin user id to scan an
application? An admin id will of course have more access than a normal user
id and the idea of limiting users to non-admin ids is to limit their ability
to break things. My understanding is that the scan is done from the outside
to determine if there are any security holes in the application that need to
be closed before the application is put into production. Since we don?t
advertise the admin user id to the world, why would we give the scanning
software an admin id? Wouldn?t a normal user id do the trick?

Thanks for your thoughts,

We'll typically try to get two sets of credentials for each role (just in case one account gets locked out).

You want to be able to exercise the entire application - all the pages, all the forms, etc.  You can only do this if the account(s) used to scan the application have access to the pages and features.  It may be that an admin account can access all the pages so you can get away with using just an admin account.  More often I have noticed that there is value in running an uncredentialed scan, a scan for a normal user with an account and a scan for an admin user (and so on based on how many roles there are in the application).

Having vulnerabilities accessible to only admin accounts is likely not acceptable.  Those may be prioritized with the same level of severity as publicly-accessible vulnerabilities, but you still need to know that they exist so they can be prioritized for remediation.  Don't forget about insider threats.

And it is important to understand that scans - even with admin credentials - aren't going to find all vulnerabilities.  Consider augmenting scanning with manual penetration as well as code review.

Thanks,

Dan

When possible, I like to test applications with several accounts of
varying privlege.  Testing with different roles helps me identify
business logical flaws and potential weaknesses in the authorization
scheme.  As an example, an admin account may help me discover an area of
an application that may not immediately be identifiable to a regular
user (accounting, reporting, admin functions).  I then attempt to force
browse or perform admin operations with an account that should not have
sufficient rights.

Topic - CRM Security

Abstract

Customer relationship management (CRM) systems are increasingly being used
by organizations to increase revenue and improve efficiencies within their
sales organizations. The overall objective of CRM is to identify, acquire,
and retain customers, meaning that these systems contain information that
has a direct impact on the competitive advantage of the organizaiton. It is
therefore critical that this information be protected from unauthorized
access or modification. This session will highlight the risks inherent
within these systems and how to address them from both a process and
technical perspective.

Speaker:

Mark Adams

Mark is a subject matter expert in the area of IT security, compliance and
audit. He has almost seven years of experience working for ?Big 4? public
accounting firms where he specialized in reviews of information system
security, as well as compliance with regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley,
HIPAA, and GLBA. Prior to his Big 4 career he supported IT departments in
both the banking and energy sectors for over six years as a network,
systems, and security administrator. His work for clients has included risk
management consulting, penetration testing, IT controls evaluation, and
security policy reviews and training. He currently works in the Application
Security Group at Halliburton where he works with project managers in making
sure that their applications can pass an audit.
