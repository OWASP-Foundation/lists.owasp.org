<PRE>Hello World -

I just wanted to remind you of today's event, I had a chance to meet  
Cassio at the OWASP Poland conference and it is a real honor to host  
him in Minneapolis. If you don't have any plans this evening don't  
miss this! We'll be taking a break the month of July unless anyone is  
interested in presenting this July. However, keep in mind we need a  
month in advance to make all the necessary arrangements and therefore  
it may be difficult to get location at the last minute for July, if  
you have a presentation or an idea for event please don't hesitate to  
share it with me or Lorna.  Also don't forget Bruce Schneier will be  
speaking at University of Minnesota's Bell Museum Auditorium August  
24th stay tuned for more.

June 29th OWASP Meeting &#8211; Cassio Goldschmidt
Tracking the progress of an SDL program: lessons from the gym

Monday, June 29th, 2009, 6:00 p.m.


Forcing muscle growth is a long process which requires high intensity  
weight training and high mental concentration. While the ultimate goal  
is often clear, one of the greatest mistakes bodybuilders consistently  
make is to overlook the importance of tracking their weight lifting  
progress.


Like a successful bodybuilding workout, a security development  
lifecycle program must consistently log simple to obtain, yet  
meaningful metrics throughout the entire process. Good metrics must  
lack subjectivity and clearly aid decision makers to determine areas  
that need improvement. In this presentation we&#8217;ll discuss metrics used  
to classify and appropriately compare security vulnerabilities found  
in different phases of the SDL by different teams working in different  
locations and in different products. We&#8217;ll also discuss how to easily  
provide decision makers different views of the same data and verify  
whether the process is indeed catching critical vulnerabilities  
internally.
