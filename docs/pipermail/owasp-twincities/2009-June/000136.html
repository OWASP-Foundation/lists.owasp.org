Description: June 29th OWASP Meeting &#8211; Cassio Goldschmidt
Tracking the progress of an SDL program: lessons from the gym

Monday, June 29th, 2009, 6:00 p.m.
Forcing muscle growth is a long process which requires high intensity  
weight training and high mental concentration. While the ultimate goal is  
often clear, one of the greatest mistakes bodybuilders consistently make is  
to overlook the importance of tracking their weight lifting progress.

Like a successful bodybuilding workout, a security development lifecycle  
program must consistently log simple to obtain, yet meaningful metrics  
throughout the entire process. Good metrics must lack subjectivity and  
clearly aid decision makers to determine areas that need improvement. In  
this presentation we&#8217;ll discuss metrics used to classify and appropriately  
compare security vulnerabilities found in different phases of the SDL by  
different teams working in different locations and in different products.  
We&#8217;ll also discuss how to easily provide decision makers different views of  
the same data and verify whether the process is indeed catching critical  
vulnerabilities internally.
