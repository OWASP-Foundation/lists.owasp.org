Talk Title: What Permissions Does Your Database User REALLY Need?

Abstract:Attaching web applications to databases as ?sa? or ?root? might be
easy but it is also a horrible idea. This presentation provides a
methodology as well as tools to create fine-grained database user
permissions based on application-specific requirements. The negative impact
of permissive database user account permissions is demonstrated alongside
the potential benefits of constrained database user access. Tools for the
automated creation of security-role-specific MySQL user permission policies
will be demonstrated and these will be used as a model for making ?least
privilege? database accounts a standard practice in web application
deployment.

Subject: [Owasp-twincities] OWASP-MSP April Meeting (yes finally)
Message-ID: <CAERhyr+cHvSJgh-PSMsW5dJ4YXxuUDOQWMq+Xo70+481LhrbEw@mail.gmail.com>

OWASP April meeting



During this meeting we had approximately 20 in attendance.   The group
discussed whether OWASP-MSP should continue with monthly presentations and
a one day fall event or if we should change it up some and participate in
OWASP Projects, have more local presenters or other OWASP sponsored
activities in addition to the usual presentation schedule.

During the discussion the following topics were talked about:

List of guidelines/hot sheets ? following in the spirit of the Top Ten

More local presenters

A two day educational event that targets developers

A capture the flag (or series of them) ? this included a variation that
would be defensively oriented targeting students and extends beyond a
weekend ctf.

Educational curriculum for MIS, CS degrees ? outreach to
colleges/Universities

OWASP outreach ? criteria docs as a project.  This ties back to the
lists/hot sheets idea.

Create sub groups or interest groups for info sharing among ?practitioners?.
For example, an interest group for static analysis tool users.

Contribute to existing projects like Zap Proxy, ESAPI, developer guide.

A summer of Code event out of the twin cities

Discussion around local impact and global impact.

Active OWASP-MSP participation in local JUG/NUG (etal).

Effort to break down the big OWASP docs/books and simplify them.

App Sec Camp ? 1 or 2 day event targeting development audience that will
provide ?(?) day sessions

 These are listed in the order that I believe would be most feasible for
the Chapter to accomplish.

Local Presenters ? seek out our local knowledge and experience ? requires
volunteers

Create sub-groups or interest groups for info sharing among practitioners ?
requires volunteers to lead subgroups, moderate and keep them active.  Perhaps
each sub-group brings back an ?update? to the Chapter (quarterly or twice a
year).
OWASP members participating in local Development professional groups
(JUG/NUG for example).  Members would seek to present in to these groups.

Hot Sheets ? This seems like it could be an extension of the Cheat Sheets
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cheat_Sheets

App Sec Camp ? An event that is geared to half day or full day sessions
targeting development staff or possibly uniquely developers.

 Local OWASP project reaching out to Colleges to bring App Sec into the
curriculum.  This would be a longer term project that would connect with
different institutions and start as guest lectures progressing to
materials/curriculum in cooperation with the colleges.

To move forward with any of the above ?

1)      *Volunteer to lead the ?effort?*

2)    *  **A minimum of another volunteer to help work on the item*
Once we have people committed we can publish to the Chapter which items
have volunteers and they can set direction and timing for their ?projects?.

Results of volunteers:projects will be communicated in July.  A meeting to
move these forward will be tentatively scheduled for July 16.  Location and
time is TBD.
