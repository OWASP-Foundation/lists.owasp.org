Welcome to OWASP MSP in 2016

Our February Chapter meeting is scheduled for February 17th at the Ewald
Conference Ctr in St Paul.

We welcome David Lindner to follow up his last talk:

Testing Tools for iOS Applications -  With the surge of mobile applications
into the forefront of most any organization, making sure the applications
are secure is becoming a pain point. Both internally developed and 3rd
party mobile applications are being used by all sorts of businesses to be
faster and more efficient in their day-to-day work. However, how do we test
for vulnerabilities? What tools exist for testing of such mobile
applications? Join Dave, as he will walk us through testing of an iOS
application using his toolbox, including idb, cycrypt, snoop-it and much
more. He will take you through the pain points of testing and show you what
tools can and cannot do for you. This talk will be focused primarily on
demoing the tools and having an interactive discussion.
*REGISTRATION REQUIRED*
