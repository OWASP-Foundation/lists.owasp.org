<PRE>Our next meeting is next Tuesday, 4/18.
We will meet in Roseville at Integral Business Solutions.
Our special presentation will be on AppArmor, by Mick Bauer.
Also, invite friends, co-workers and vendors.
To make progress we need to continually tell people what we're working on.

Oh, and another good reason to attend: Lorna is providing food.
Details below.

*Special Guest Presentation*

This month Mick Bauer will present AppArmor. AppArmor proactively protects
the operating system and applications from external or internal threats,
even zero-day attacks, by enforcing good behavior and preventing even
unknown application flaws from being exploited. AppArmor security policies
completely define what system resources individual applications can access,
and with what privileges.
A number of default policies are included with AppArmor, and using a
combination of advanced static analysis and learning-based tools, AppArmor
policies for even very complex applications can be deployed successfully in
a matter of hours. AppArmor is included with SUSE Linux.

*About Mick Bauer*
Mick Bauer, CISSP, is Linux Journal's security editor and an IS security
consultant in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He wrote Linux Server Security, 2nd
Ed. (O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 2005).
