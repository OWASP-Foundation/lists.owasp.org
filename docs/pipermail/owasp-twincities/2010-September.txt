**
* How to Do Application Logging Right*

 Anton Chuvakin <http://chuvakin.blogspot.com/> and Gunnar have a paper in
the current IEEE Security & Privacy Journal - "How to Do Application Logging
Right <http://arctecgroup.net/pdf/howtoapplogging.pdf>." The paper explores
app logging from a developer's perspective. There are various standards that
mandate logging, most famously PCI DSS. PCI mandates a regime around log
storage and security and provides an event model and log format for certain
data (like financial data). For developers, though, it does not provide
guidance on audit logger placement nor what's useful to include and not
include in event payloads. Gunnar will be providing a talk modeled around
this work.
