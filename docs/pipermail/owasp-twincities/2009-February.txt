Subject: [Owasp-twincities] February 17th OWASP Meeting - Rick Ensenbach
Message-ID: <33d224060902081828m7d9659abk67bba34cbb0e1835@mail.gmail.com>

Finally! Our 1st meeting of 2009 will be on February 17th at 6pm.

 *February OWASP Meeting ?Rick Ensenbach*

*Topic Overview:*

*Proactive Lifecycle Security Management*
Security Authorization Process Overview

Security professionals are often faced with the daunting task of having to
retrofit security controls into systems after it has already been put into
production. The bad news is that this commonly occurs after sensitive or
confidential information has been exposed as a result of a preventable
system vulnerability, which often leads to public embarrassment, unnecessary
litigation, regulatory fines, loss of customer confidence and numerous
man-hours spent performing incident response and breach notification
activities.

Attend this session and learn how to ensure that security is addressed early
in the system development/acquisition process by implementing a simple,
scalable process that Federal agencies and the Department of Defense have
practiced for years. You will also learn how this process can help with
other regulatory and industry compliance requirements such as Payment Card
Industry, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,
Sarbanes-Oxley and Gramm-Leach-Bliley.

Mr. Ensenbach will also discuss available resources you can use and provide
and example of a "System Security Plan" that you can immediately start using
in your own organization and get you started on implementing your own
security authorization process.

This is a "must" attend session for all organizations that are required to
comply with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).
