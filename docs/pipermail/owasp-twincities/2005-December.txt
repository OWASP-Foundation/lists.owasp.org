Hi Everyone -

Our December meeting is tomorrow, 12/13, at the Golden Valley Library,
from 6 to 7:45PM.  Bob Sullivan had agreed to lead a discussion of the
Security Principals section
of the OWASP guide, but I haven't had a response to a confirmation
request that I sent last week - Bob, are you there?

I would also like to get an item on the agenda - we need to discuss
the 2006 plan for our group, specifically who is willing to assume my
role as mailing list admin and meeting scheduler.

Please send a note to the list & let us know if you're going to attend.  Thanks!

-daniel

Yes, Daniel
I apologize for not seeing your email or responding.
I'm ready to go for tonite's discussion of the OWASP Security Principals.
That will take about 20-30 minutes.

If there is interest, I hope to use that to launch into either:
- Have the group split up and use the material to write some interview questions
or
- Review a security breach in light of the principals

I'm willing to do the mailing list and announcements for a while.
Thanks for getting this rolling.

See you there!

Bob Sullivan

To all the OWASP participants worldwide,

 

 As 2005 comes to an end I want thank you all for making OWASP a success!
With a growing membership and skyrocketing downloads we are making a real
difference in finding and fighting the causes of application security
vulnerabilities.

 

Through your hard work in 2005, OWASP has released a completely overhauled
Guide, powerful new features in WebScarab, and hosted two successful AppSec
conferences. Our downloads have more than doubled to over 16,000 every
month, our unique visitors have doubled to almost 35,000 every month, and
our bandwidth requirements have soared 600% to over 18GB per month.

 

Our New Jersey chapter has arranged for a Holiday discount for OWASP
participants.  From now through December 31st, get 30% off any books you
order through http://www.oreilly.com/buy. Just use Discount Code HOHOHO when
you place your order.

 

Have a wonderful Holiday season and best wishes for the New Year.

 

--Jeff

Mission:
To find and fight the causes of insecure software.
To produce free, unbiased open source documentation, tools and standards.

Presentation:
This month Bob Sullivan presented Security Principles from the OWASP Guide
(Sam Buchanan assisted with commentary)
Hilights from discussion:
- Most of our jobs cover only a part of the scope needed to fully apply
principles like 'Fix security issues correctly'.
Often we're involved in one step of the detection,  analysis,  clean-up,  fix or
periodic audit.
To make significant change we need to educate the architects and product
managers.

- Simplicity, as a principle, battles with least priviledge and defense in
depth.

- Dealing with external systems is daunting. Sometimes these systems are within
our family of companies/colleges.
People at our organizations do not like it when we will not open up our systems
to them since, like we tell them, "we have to assume that your system has been
hacked".

Projects:
We discussed the possiblilty of presenting two sessions on Web Security at the
local ISSA conference.
The ISSA conference is May 17 & 18.
This would be an excellent way to promote Web Application security.

  Key questions:
  a. What is the audience that would attend the ISSA conference?
  b. What Web Application topics/demonstrations would be most successful?
A meeting with ISSA is scheduled for next week.

Business:
Two suggestions came up around meeting locations.
First, we could reach more folks from St. Paul if we met over there.
Second, we could meet somewhere that you could grab a beer.

Jan 10 at 6:00 pm we will meet at the Golden Valley Library.
Please send your ideas for topics and speakers to this list.

ISSA is planning for three tracks at the spring conference.
One each for people, process and technology.

They have asked us to put together a few survey questions that they could
distribute to their membership to guage interest in web application security.

I have put together a draft survey that describes three potential offerings for
the technology track.
Please offer you comments to refine these descriptions.

I would like to do this on the list with some discussion and completion at the
January meeting.

--------survey begins here---------------------------------------
Please rate your interest on the following three potential presentations:

a. The OWASP Top Ten web application security vulnerabilities. (1 hour)
Learn about the Top Ten Vulnerabilities and how to protect against them.

The OWASP Top Ten provides a minimum standard for web application security. The
OWASP Top Ten represents a
broad consensus about what the most critical web application security flaws are.
Project members include a
variety of security experts from around the world who have shared their
expertise to produce this list.
There are currently versions in English, French, Japanese, and Korean. A Spanish
version is in the works.
We urge all companies to adopt the standard within their organization and start
the process of ensuring
that their web applications do not contain these flaws. Adopting the OWASP Top
Ten is perhaps the most
effective first step towards changing the software development culture within
your organization into one
that produces secure code.

1 - Yes, I will certainly attend
2 - Interested, need more information
3 - Not interested


b. Web Application Security: vulnerabilities, detection tools and
countermeasures.(1 hour)
The recent rash of web application attacks is part of the growing threat to
online commerce and your use of
the internet. Learn about the vulnerabilities, implications and response to a
web attack. View three sample
attacks and learn about business processes and tools to close the web
application security gap.


1 - Yes, I will certainly attend
2 - Interested, need more information
3 - Not interested

c. Web Application Security: detection and testing tools (4 one-hour sessions)
Alternate (hot) name: "Web Application Hacking tools and techniques"
The web application security threat is growing, yet it is costly to acquire and
maintain knowledge on how
to test and protect your web application. This workshop will train you to find
your own weaknesses using a
free set of tools developed by the Open Web Application Security Project
(OWASP).
You will receive instruction to install and use these OWASP tools:
WebGoat   : A J2EE web application designed to teach security lessons.
WebScarab : A framework and web proxy tool used to capture and modify HTTP(s)
converstaions.

Hands-on lessons will be presented on some of the following vulnerabilities:
-Cross Site Scripting
-SQL Injection
-Thread Safety
-Hidden Form Field Manipulation
-Parameter Manipulation
-Weak Session Cookies
-Fail Open Authentication
-Dangers of HTML Comments
-Web services
-Blind SQL
-Weak session identifier


1 - Yes, I will certainly attend
2 - Interested, need more information
3 - Not interested

That's it,
Bob Sullivan
