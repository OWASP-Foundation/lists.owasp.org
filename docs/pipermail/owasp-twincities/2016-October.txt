All, we had not planned for an October meeting, but Jeremy will be in town
and offered to speak about the OWASP Dependency Check project and
vulnerable 3rd party libraries, so we had to take him up on it.
This is a very important area of discussion in software security and it is
a great opportunity to hear from an expert in the subject.

We welcome Jeremy Long as our October Chapter meeting speaker.

Depending on Vulnerable Libraries

Java applications built today use several third-party libraries and
frameworks. We depend on these building blocks so we can build applications
faster. However, if one of the libraries we depend on has a known,
published vulnerability, then our application may have inherited that
vulnerability. This session covers the OWASP Dependency-Check project. It
discusses how the tool works and how you can integrate it into your
application build process to validate whether or not your application is
using known vulnerable libraries.
