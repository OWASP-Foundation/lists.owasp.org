Description: June 29th OWASP Meeting ? Cassio Goldschmidt
Tracking the progress of an SDL program: lessons from the gym

Monday, June 29th, 2009, 6:00 p.m.
Forcing muscle growth is a long process which requires high intensity  
weight training and high mental concentration. While the ultimate goal is  
often clear, one of the greatest mistakes bodybuilders consistently make is  
to overlook the importance of tracking their weight lifting progress.

Like a successful bodybuilding workout, a security development lifecycle  
program must consistently log simple to obtain, yet meaningful metrics  
throughout the entire process. Good metrics must lack subjectivity and  
clearly aid decision makers to determine areas that need improvement. In  
this presentation we?ll discuss metrics used to classify and appropriately  
compare security vulnerabilities found in different phases of the SDL by  
different teams working in different locations and in different products.  
We?ll also discuss how to easily provide decision makers different views of  
the same data and verify whether the process is indeed catching critical  
vulnerabilities internally.

Deb, Thanks for letting me know. I did not realize you had relocated.
I'll remove you from our list. You may receive a confirmation e-mail
from the system, I'm  not sure how exactly it is set up.
Best of luck!

Hello World -

I just wanted to remind you of today's event, I had a chance to meet  
Cassio at the OWASP Poland conference and it is a real honor to host  
him in Minneapolis. If you don't have any plans this evening don't  
miss this! We'll be taking a break the month of July unless anyone is  
interested in presenting this July. However, keep in mind we need a  
month in advance to make all the necessary arrangements and therefore  
it may be difficult to get location at the last minute for July, if  
you have a presentation or an idea for event please don't hesitate to  
share it with me or Lorna.  Also don't forget Bruce Schneier will be  
speaking at University of Minnesota's Bell Museum Auditorium August  
24th stay tuned for more.

Hi all,
Don't forget the OWASP meeting is tonight and starts at 6pm. I used
the OWASP calendaring so it might show up on your calendar an hour
earlier than the actual time of the meeting since OWASP is
headquartered on the East Coast.

We have a new location for this meeting so make to check the map.

Look forward to seeing you there!

Lorna
