Ok,
Happy New Year.

Maybe you saw the news that 2 Million people had been notified of a lost 
backup tape last month. I received one of those letters from my mortgage 
company ABN-AMRO. 
Then, yesterday, I received another letter. It says that they found the 
tape. That's really good news to me personally. However, it looks like the 
cost of responding to a breach just went up.

Instead of just sending one letter, and providing some free credit-check 
services they are sending two letters. At 27 cents a piece that is 1.08$ 
Million for postage alone. 2006 is sure to be an exciting year in 
information security .

Ideas for the January Meeting (1/10 6:00pm Golden Valley Library)
For the next meeting I would like to see us kick around some ideas on the 
mailing list.
(Do not be bashful, this is a small group and we need you to reply.)
That will give us all some specific ideas of what we can contriubute or 
take away from the meetings.

1. Present and discuss a few WebGoat Lessons
- Can you volunteer to present a WebGoat lesson or
- vote for one of these:
   o How to Perform Database Cross Site Scripting
   o How to Spoof and Authentication Cookie
   o How to Exploit Hidden Fields
   o How to Discover Clues in the HTML
   o How to Perform Parameter Injection
   o How to Perform SQL Injection
   o How to Exploit Thread Safety Problems
   o How to Exploit Unchecked Email
   o How to Spoof an Authentication Cookie

2. Choose a book to read and discuss a chapter each month
- You can nominate a security book that you would like to read and discuss
(I don't see anything newer than 2003, are security books dead?)

3. Discuss Threat Modeling as a group
- What methods have you used (Home Grown, STRIDE/DREAD, Trike, ...)?
- What are the strengths/weaknesses of each method?
- What works?
- What doesn't?

- You really have an opinion on a Threat Modelling discussion:
  o good idea
  o bad idea
  o here ar some specific resources that we found useful

Thanks,
Bob Sullivan

Thank you, Bob, for digging in and making these suggestions. 

I like the idea of going through a WebGoat lesson or two. If I didn't
have a baby due any day now and could be confident that I'll be at
Tuesday's meeting, I'd volunteer. Maybe for a future month. I'll tell
you what I'd be interested in seeing: exploiting thread safety problems.
That's an area I'm not nearly adequately familiar with.

As for security books... the Web Application Security Consortium has a
list specific to web apps:
http://www.webappsec.org/web_security_books.shtml 

I would be very much interested in hearing someone's experiences with
threat modeling. It's a practice I'm trying to introduce to our
development process, but all I really have to go on is what I've read of
Microsoft's experiences. These are detailed enough and useful, but I'd
like to hear from anyone on the group who has more direct experience
with threat modeling.

Question: monthly meetings don't seem to be working for us right now.
Should we try for bimonthly until there's more active and assured
partication?

Thanks again, Bob.
Sam

For a future meeting it would be fun to see if Mick Bauer (Paranoid  
Penguin columnist in Linux Journal and O'Reilly author) to talk about  
securing Linux Web Servers. I emailed him, and perhaps Joe could also  
see if he would be game?

Subject: [Owasp-twincities] January meeting cancelled: Bi-Monthly beginning Feb 14
Message-ID: <0C1903BB4A7C704089F80F29E1C05C5704DD326A@EMAILSTORE18.target.com>

 
I'd like to also discuss the possibility of working on a project that
would facilitate the vulnerability assessment  and/or audit of
apps/Webapps for IT Audit/Assurance/Security folks who are not
developers.  For example, working off of the SSE-CMM to create a
general, repeatable process which could then be customized to the
organization.  
 
Ten years ago I entered the IT industry as a developer but went on to
the network/sysadmin side of the house.  I've focused my expertise on IT
Security & IT audit for the past seven years.  Consequently, in relation
to my peers, I have a bit more understanding of what is important for
app. security but still not enough to conduct manual audits/assessments
properly and thoroughly.  I really feel a gap exists in this area and
security tools like Appscan etc.... are relied upon too much.  Further,
most IT security and audit shops just choose not to look at the apps. in
depth as they are too complex.  As I think you'll agree, perimeter or
zoned security is meaningless if the application can be compromised.
 
With the increase in compliance and regulatory pressures (SOX, PCI,
BASEL, GLBA, HIPAA) as well as the momentum that is being gained by
other legislation, I think this is an area that requires more attention
and any work towards a useable process would be well received.
 
I would appreciate any feedback you may have.  
 
Regards,
 
S. Scott Ammon

The focus on assurance techniques in combination with design and  
development (OWASP's main focus) makes a lot of sense. Brian Snow  
talked about how these two relate in his paper We Need Assurance. I  
blogged/annotated here:

http://1raindrop.typepad.com/1_raindrop/2005/12/the_road_to_ass.html

and
