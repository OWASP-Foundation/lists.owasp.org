Subject: [Owasp-twincities] OWASP meeting 3/31/08 - How NOT to implement
	encryption for the OWASP Top Ten
Message-ID: <96de2fe20803241116m55edd4e9m1baaab5238bffe10@mail.gmail.com>

Hello World!

REMINDER ** Please join us next Monday March 31st for another exciting OWASP
meeting.  Tony Stieber will talk about How NOT to implement encryption for
the OWASP Top Ten. I had the opportunity to see Tony presenting his draft
about two weeks a go at the DC612 meeting and I have to tell you that Tony
is really touching some good and often forgotten points when implementing
encryption in web applications.  I have hardly seen any topic focused on
these three areas of the OWASP Top Ten and Tony is really doing a great job.
 If you are a web developer, involved in deploying e-commerce sites or even
a regular web surfer  you should be in this meeting.  Bring questions! here
is a good chance to get those questions answered by an industry expert.
Topic Overview:
How NOT to implement encryption for the OWASP Top Ten. Three out of the ten
items in the OWASP Top Ten are related to encryption. These items, A7, A8,
and A9, are merely misuse or non-use of well-known and readily available
tools. Best practices will be explained and illustrated with
counter-examples with the goal of explaining how web applications and
cryptography meet.

Date: March 31st, 2008
Time: 6 p.m.
Location: Gourmet Dinning Room - MnScu Technology Building (T), Minneapolis
Campus
Address: 1501 Hennepin Avenue, Minneapolis, MN 55403 (Hennepin and Spruce)

Speaker Bio:
Tony Stieber has been working in the information security industry for over
12 years, with 8 of those years in the Fortune 100. His past experience
includes mainframes, supercomputers, military and commercial firewalls,
medical diagnostic systems, dot com ventures, retail environments, large
financial systems, and cryptology.

Sponsors:
We are still looking for local sponsors to help us pay for meeting's
refreshments as well as possible travel cost and provide books for our book
giveaway. Pretty soon we will use all of this year's Owasp On The Move
(OoTm) travel cost for our local chapter.  If we want to get more high
profile outside speakers it is important we get local support.  We have
already gotten some responses and support in this area but we still need
more support.

Thank you all again for all your help.

Volunteers:
For those of you who have emailed me interested in helping us. Please plan
on meeting with Lorna and I for 15 minutes after the meeting.

We are in need of a volunteer to help us keep track of our local sponsoring
funds - anyone with accounting skills interested?

Thanks to:  <http://www.strategicit.org/>

I want to thank Mitch Moon for donating the book for the upcoming book
giveaway.  The book we will be giving away at this meeting is titled -
"Software Security - Building Security in" - By Gary McGraw. I have been
reading a copy of this book and I really recommend it. This is a must have
if you are interested in the software security industry.
