Talk Title: *How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Teach Developers*

Can you speak developer? In this talk, we will discuss building a security
awareness program as it relates to your most tech-savvy users&#8211;software
engineers. In this day-and-age of sharing and online openness, we&#8217;ll talk
about strategies to keep your secrets confidential, while at the same time
allowing your developers access to the information they need to get their
job done. Understanding the pressures and day-to-day responsibilities a
developer experiences goes a long way in understanding how to best approach
security. Awareness is only one step in writing secure code, but it is
often the biggest challenge you need to face in establishing a successful
application security program. Whether you are building the program from the
ground-up, or tweaking current processes to make the program run a bit
smoother, having the development team working with you is essential in
making sure your entire application environment is secure. Arming your
developers with the knowledge and awareness they need means less headaches
for you when it comes time for the dreaded code review.

Perry Hemmingsen
is a Senior Security Analyst at a major health care/health insurance
provider, focusing primarily on application security as it relates to web
applications, mobile devices and service-oriented architecture. From time
to time, he also works on projects surrounding data encryption, internal
vulnerability assessment, web and mobile HIPAA and PCI compliance, and
third-party software acquisitions. Within the last two years, he has
successfully developed brand new procedures around web and mobile
application security, including implementing tools for static analysis.
Perry has also developed curriculum and implemented in-house security
training, educating software developers on appropriate security topics and
techniques for identification and mitigation within their own code
