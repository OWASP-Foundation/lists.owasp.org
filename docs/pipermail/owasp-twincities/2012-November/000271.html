*OWASP MSP day of AppSec talks. *

Please join us for an &quot;OWASP Day in MN&quot; Thursday November 29th in the North
Star Ballroom on the University of Minnesota  St Paul Campus (Student
center) . We will have a series of speakers and lunch will be provided,
plus the opportunity for you to meet others in our community or catch up
with those you already know. Among our speakers will be:



*Matt Konda and John Rose *

*Builders VS Breakers a debate*

After 15 years building software, Matt founded Jemurai to try to bridge the
gap between developers and security experts. He does training, security
code reviews, and agile security consulting - but is focused on developing
security tools for developers, including a product called HoneyField that
provides analytics around security events.
Prior to starting Jemurai, Matt lead development teams focused on network
vulnerability scanners, web scanners, certificate authority infrastructure
and tools to manage penetration test engagements.

* *

Hacker, developer, product manager, and trainer, Jon Rose has been working
in the security industry for his entire career. His current mission is to
make security accessible to developers, small businesses, and service
providers through a variety of ventures. Outside technology, his other
interests include running, camping, coffee, robots, and beer.



John and Matt will have a lively moderated debate from a builder vs.
breaker view point. Who&#8217;s right? You be the judge.**

* *

*Bob Sullivan *

Bob Sullivan is a consultant, security program leader and instructor. He's
been educated at Wisconsin/Madison and St. Thomas/St. Paul and holds CISM,
CISA and CISSP certifications. For the last six years he has been
responsible for testing and improving security posture of 100s of websites
at local Fortune 100 companies. Bob has contributed to the OWASP WebGoat
and Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) projects. Bob has worked in all phases of the
software development lifecycle as developer, tester, manager, code
reviewer, penetration tester, trainer and auditor.



*You will get fired, unless you learn from our mistakes *

Do you worry that you might make a mistake that will damage your employer
and cost you your job? Should you report an incident, or keep it private?
Should you accept responsibility or deflect? Bob reviews personal
experience and public security incidents to discuss ten lessons that will
should keep you employed and keep your company safe.



*Antti Rantasaari &amp; Scott Sutherland *

Antti Rantasaari is currently a security consultant at NetSPI. He is
responsible for performing security assessments and contributing to the
development of the methodologies, techniques, and tools used during network
and application penetration testing.



Scott Sutherland is a Principal Security Consultant at NetSPI. Scott is
responsible for the development and execution of penetration testing for
the firm. He has developed a number of the proprietary tools and techniques
that the company uses and also plays a major role in the skills development
and training of the NetSPI network and application penetration testing
team. Scott is an active participant in the information security community,
regularly contributing technical security blog posts, whitepapers, and
presenting at a wide variety of conferences.



*SQL Server Exploitation, Escalation, and Pilfering *

During this presentation attendees will be introduced to lesser known, yet
significant vulnerabilities in SQL Server implementations related to common
trust relationships, misconfigurations, and weak default settings. The
issues that will be covered are often leveraged by attackers to gain
unauthorized access to high value systems, applications, and sensitive
data. An overview of each issue, common vectors of attack, and manual
techniques will be covered. Finally newly created Metasploit modules and
TSQL scripts will be demonstrated that help automate the attacks. This
presentation will be valuable to penetration testers who are looking for
faster ways to gain access to critical data and systems. Additionally, it
should be worthwhile for developers and database administrators who are
interested in gaining a better understanding of how to protect their
applications and databases from these attacks.



*Jay Jacobs and Kevin Thompson*

Jay Jacobs is principal with the Verizon RISK team focusing on information
security data analysis and the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report.
Jay is a co-founder of the Society of Information Risk Analysts and
currently serves on the organization&#8217;s board of directors. He is also one
of the primary authors of the OpenPERT project, an open-source Excel
plug-in for risk analysis. He is an active blogger, as well as a published
author and co-host on the Risk Hose podcast. Jacobs hold his bachelor&#8217;s
degree in technology and management from Concordia University in Saint
Paul, MN.



Kevin Thompson is an analyst with the Verizon RISK team where he performs
research on the ever-changing risk environment, investigates all manner of
security incidents, and helps to develop solutions and knowledge based on
credible data and analysis. Kevin is one of the researchers working on the
wildly popular Data Breach Investigations Report and the underlying VERIS
framework. Prior to working for Verizon, Kevin has worked in information
security and risk management in higher education, health care, and the U.S.
Navy. Kevin is CISSP certified, and is a FAIR certified risk analyst. Kevin
also serves on the board of directors for the Society of Information Risk
Analysts and is an adjunct faculty teaching information security and risk
management at Minnesota State University, Mankato.



*&quot;How Important is Web Application Security?&quot; *

Jay Jacobs and Kevin Thompson have tried to answer &quot;How important is Web
Application Security?&quot; by analyzing over 2,000 cases of confirmed data
breaches. They'll set the stage by covering the findings in the 2012 Data
Breach Investigation Report and then they will dive into the details they
discovered while trying to answer this elusive question.



Registration is required.

The registration fee is $25 for OWASP members and $75 for non-members (the
fee will include an OWASP membership good for a year).
