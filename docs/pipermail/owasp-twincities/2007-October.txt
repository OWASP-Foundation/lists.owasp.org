 *Continuous Testing: Andre Gironda*

Continuous testing presents methodologies and tools that developers, quality
engineers, and security professionals can all share and use effectively to
their own unique approach. The tools presented are cross-discipline, meaning
they can be utilized by a developer as a development tool, by a qa-tester as
a quality assurance tool, and by a vulnerability assessor as a security
assurance tool. Whether you're trying to build better code faster,
demonstrate the power of automated testing using a data-driven test
framework, or find security-related defects - Continuous testing has
something for you.

*Java Open Review: OWASP & Fortify *

Fortify has sought to develop a set of metrics that combine lessons learned
from our experience working on various enterprise code bases and our work on
the Java Open Review project. The metrics are designed to incorporate
diverse criteria, including the size of the application, and the types of
vulnerabilities identified. The metrics provide a mechanism to rate software
components for security concerns and enable enterprises to:
- Evaluate which open source projects offer an acceptable level of security
- Compare competing open source software solutions based on their security
- Measure internal development efforts against open source counterparts

*Looking for a new Chapter Lead:
*This position give you the opportunity to meet great people, gain
leadership experience and bring the application security story to the Twin
Cities. The work is light and requires that you coordinate speakers, food
and room for the bi-monthly meetings.  You should be willing to do it for
two years because it gets easier over time. If you are interested in the
position reply to this email or bring it up at the meeting 10/16.

Big thanks go out to Lorna (Integral Business Solutions) for arranging the
room and eats.

That's it, stick to the code.
