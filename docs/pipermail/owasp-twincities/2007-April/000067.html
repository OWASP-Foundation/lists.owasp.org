*Speaker Bios:*

Joe Teff is a security group manager at Wells Fargo and a charter member of
OWASP-Twin Cities. His knowledge and experience cover a broad range of
security domains.

Muthu Meyyappan is a Sr. Application Security Architect at United Healthcare


He will describe a new OWASP Project: XML Security Gateway Evaluation
Criteria Project

This OWASP Project defines an open standard for evaluating XML Security
Gateways. This criteria will provide the OWASP community a set of standard
evaluation criteria to assess the functionality and quality of XML Security
Gateways. The main driver for this project is to reduce the confusion and
complexity in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of solutions in this
the XML Security space, and enlightening the community as to the utility of
XML Security Gateways to deliver a number of valuable security services.



*Future Topics:*
These could include an active tools market:
- Source Code Analysis
- Automated Web App. Testing
- Web App Firewalls
- XML Security
- Database Security
- Identity Management
- Biometrics
- Cryptography

Alternatively, it would be of great benefit to present something legislation
or industry specific:
- Homeland Security
- Payment Card Institute (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS)  Compliance
- Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Compliance
- Sarbanes Oxley
- Gramm Leech Bliley
- Building a web application security practice

*Book Giveaway:*
