Welcome to the OWASP MSP July 2016 Meeting

We are happy to have Caroline Wong speaking about Software Security and
Metrics.

Sfotware Security Metrics: More often than not, company executives ask the
wrong questions about software security.  This session will discuss
techniques for changing the conversation about software security in order
to encourage executives to ask the right questions ? and provide answers
that show progress towards meaningful objectives.  Caroline will discuss a
progression of software security capabilities and the metrics that
correspond to different levels of maturity.  She?ll discuss an approach for
developing key metrics for your unique software security program and walk
through a detailed example.

Europe), ITWeb Summit (South Africa), Metricon, the Executive Women's
Forum, ISC2 and the Information Security Forum.  Caroline contributed as a
