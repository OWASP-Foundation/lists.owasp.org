OWASP MSP August 2016 Chapter Meeting

August 24 at the Ewald Center - Registration Required

Topic: Practical Identity Access Management: Lessons from the Field

Building Identity Access Management solutions can be difficult. This
presentation reviews lessons learned from designing and building IAM
solutions in multiple states, focusing on the unique challenges of IAM in
government, which must serve the needs of three separate groups: the
public, government agencies, and NGOs. Lessons drawn from real-world
experiences will demonstrate what works, what doesn?t, and how to fix
things when they go wrong.

Following the flow of a typical user?s experience, the presentation will
cover the successes, and failures of designing an IAM solution: getting a
user ID, logging in to the system, matching ?me? as a public user to ?my
data,? and getting access to the system. Along the way, we will explore
lessons about how design choices for each step can impact that experience.

Also covered are designs that were not implemented, sharing the vision of
how automated user-driven access requests, changes, and reviews can both
improve user experience and lower costs.

Desired Learning Outcomes

This talk will include real-world lessons on:

? Selection of IAM products

? Why people might have 3 (or more) user IDs, and why that?s good

? Single Sign-On protocols, including SAML

? Why controlling usernames is so important, and how usernames can cause
problems

? The critical differences between a ?user? and a ?person?

? What ?identity matching? is and how it relates to IAM

? When and how to verify a user?s identity

? How IAM can be used to integrate multiple systems with separate
authorization databases

? Managing the costs of public users
