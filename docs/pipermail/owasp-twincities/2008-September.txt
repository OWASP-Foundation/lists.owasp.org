Jeremiah Grossman: Get Rich or Die Trying - Making Money on The Web,
The Black Hat Way

Forget Cross-Site Scripting. Forget SQL Injection. If you want to make
some serious cash on the Web silently and surreptitiously, you don't
need them. You also don't need noisy scanners, sophisticated proxies,
0-days, or ninja level reverse engineering skills -- all you need is a
Web browser, a clue on what to look for, and a few black hat tricks.
Generating affiliate advertising revenue from the Website traffic of
others, trade stock using corporation information passively gleaned,
inhibit the online purchase of sought after items creating artificial
scarcity, and so much more. Activities not technically illegal, only
violating terms of service.

You may have heard these referred to as business logic flaws, but that
name really doesn't do them justice. It sounds so academic and benign
in that context when the truth is anything but. These are not the same
ol' Web hacker attack techniques everyone is familiar with, but the
one staring you in the face and missed because gaming a system and
making money this way couldn't be that simple. Plus IDS can't detect
them and Web application firewalls can't black them. If fact, these
types of attacks are so hard to detect (if anyone is actually trying)
we aren't even sure how widespread their use actually is. Time to pull
back the cover and expose what's possible.
