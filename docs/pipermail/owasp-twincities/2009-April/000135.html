<PRE>Reminder for tonight's meeting
 We are meeting in Room L3000. This is in the Library Building on the 3rd
floor. Wheelock Whitney Hall. This room is a little harder to find
(understatement)
if you haven't been to a meeting on the 3rd floor previously.  I'll have
signs up in as many locations as I can. My cell is 651-338-0243. - Lorna
April OWASP Meeting &#8211; Gunnar Peterson
OWASP Top Ten Web Services

Monday, April 27, 2009, 6:00 p.m.

What do Web apps, Web 2.0, Cloud Computing, SOA, and Rest all have in
common? They all use Web services for functionality, data access and
integration. Unfortunately, by default Web services also lack a security
model. The OWASP Top Ten Web Services goes into the technical details of the
vulnerabilities, remediations, and examples of common Web services security
issues like authentication and authorization flaws, how sensitive data is
disclosed, and why security standards like WS-Security and SAML can be your
best friend or your worst nightmare.
