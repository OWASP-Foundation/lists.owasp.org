<PRE> 
I'd like to also discuss the possibility of working on a project that
would facilitate the vulnerability assessment  and/or audit of
apps/Webapps for IT Audit/Assurance/Security folks who are not
developers.  For example, working off of the SSE-CMM to create a
general, repeatable process which could then be customized to the
organization.  
 
Ten years ago I entered the IT industry as a developer but went on to
the network/sysadmin side of the house.  I've focused my expertise on IT
Security &amp; IT audit for the past seven years.  Consequently, in relation
to my peers, I have a bit more understanding of what is important for
app. security but still not enough to conduct manual audits/assessments
properly and thoroughly.  I really feel a gap exists in this area and
security tools like Appscan etc.... are relied upon too much.  Further,
most IT security and audit shops just choose not to look at the apps. in
depth as they are too complex.  As I think you'll agree, perimeter or
zoned security is meaningless if the application can be compromised.
 
With the increase in compliance and regulatory pressures (SOX, PCI,
BASEL, GLBA, HIPAA) as well as the momentum that is being gained by
other legislation, I think this is an area that requires more attention
and any work towards a useable process would be well received.
 
I would appreciate any feedback you may have.  
 
Regards,
 
S. Scott Ammon

For a future meeting it would be fun to see if Mick Bauer (Paranoid
Penguin columnist in Linux Journal and O'Reilly author) to talk about
securing Linux Web Servers. I emailed him, and perhaps Joe could also
see if he would be game?
