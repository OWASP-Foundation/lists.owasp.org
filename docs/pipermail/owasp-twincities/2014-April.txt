Subject: [Owasp-twincities] Mid-Sized Healthcare Client-Bloomington, MN
Message-ID: <BLU181-W10CC34AC31312462653B41B0520@phx.gbl>

Hello OWASP Enthusiasts!

 

My mid-sized healthcare client in Bloomington is looking for
a OWASP-minded Java developer to identify and resolve security vulnerabilities
in their existing J2EE web application.  This individual will be working
on a pre-designed solution, but would be responsible for coding and re-design
as needed.  The contract opportunity will initially be a 3-6 month
engagement, but our previous consultants have been extended beyond the initial
contract duration.

 

My mid-sized healthcare client offers:

?        
The ability to work with an industry leading company

?        
A great work environment

o   Small teams

o   Flexible work
environment

o   Ability to ?wear a
lot of hats?

o   A highly collaborative and team oriented environment

?        
Opportunity to work on complex healthcare projects

?        
Regular changes to healthcare policy allow for a fast-paced, changing
environment

 

My contact information and a high level summary of the
position are included below.  

 

Thank you,

 

Nic

 

 

Title: J2EE Web Application Security Engineer

Location: Bloomington, MN

Duration: 3-6 months (with long-term extensions possible)

 

The security project will focus on a couple items that we
have identified that we would like enhanced and a couple items that have been
recommended by a 3rd party. The driver of this is to stay up to date
with security trends in the industry and vulnerabilities since we are providing
an electronic health record to our clients.

 

Description: 

Work with our development team to identify and resolve
security vulnerabilities in our J2EE web application. 

?        
Experience with Java, JSP and J2EE Web Applications

?        
Experience with OWASP and Java coding security standards

?        
Experience with scanning, identifying and resolving security
vulnerabilities in existing code
