<PRE>Hello world!

I just wanted to remind everyone!
Upcoming Speakers:Tomorrow! March 31st -

Tony Stieber, Encryption Architect for a local Fortune 500 company will be
speaking on Encryption and Web Application Security - How NOT to implement
encryption - March 31st. Tony Stieber is very knowledgeable about encryption
and Information Security. It is a real honor and a privilege to have him
speak in our group. If you have questions about encryption, He is the person
to ask. YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS!
April 21!

Rohyt Belani from Intrepidus Group will be speaking Offshoring Application
Development: Financial Dream or Security Nightmare?.
May 13th - 14th!

Secure360 Conference - RSnake and Rohyt will be coming back to MSP for this
conference. The tracks and presentations for this events are amazing! the
UMSA has been doing a great job selecting a variety of great speakers for
this event. OWASP will have a booth at this conference thanks to Integral's
sponsorship.  THANK YOU AGAIN INTEGRAL FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!!!!

*** Because of the conference there will not be an OWASP meeting for the
month of May ***

Volunteers:
A reminder to those interested in helping please see me and Lorna after the
meeting.

Sponsorships:
Anyone interested in sponsoring the local chapter to help us pay for
food/beverages or travel costs for speakers please contact me or Lorna as
well. We are very close of running out of this year's travel cost allowance
from the OWASP On The Move program. We are going to need some help if you
guys want to get more high profile speakers to come to the twin cities.

Ideas:
Do you have any topic ideas? Are you interested in participating in OWASP
projects, contact me or Lorna.

I hope to see you there tomorrow for another exciting meeting! thanks
everyone for your support!
