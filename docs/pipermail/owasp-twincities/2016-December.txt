Welcome to the January 2017 OWASP MSP Chapter Meeting

We are pleased to present Jack Mannino, who will speak about MircoServices
and Security.

Abstract:

The talk is about security in a microservice architeture. We will discuss
what translates well from monolithic design to microservices, and the bad
habits you should leave behind. In this talk we will demonstrate how to
build authentication into a microservice architecture and how to implement
a granular authorization scheme that will work effectively as you introduce
new services. At the end of this presentation, you will understand what
separates microservices from traditional monolithic applications and
understand the problem space from a secure architecture perspective.

Bio:

Jack is the CEO at Nvisium, company focused in solutions to make security
and education scale in fast-paced software development development
organizations. He has developed and contributed to industry standards for
secure web and mobile development including the OWASP Mobile Security
Project. Jack presents his research at conferences around the world, and
regularly contributes ro many open source projects. In his spare time, he
enjoys digging into new frameworks, researching Android internals and
writes most of his (good) code in Scala.
