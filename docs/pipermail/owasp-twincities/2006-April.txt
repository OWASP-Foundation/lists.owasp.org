*Special Guest Presentation*

This month Mick Bauer will present AppArmor. AppArmor proactively protects
the operating system and applications from external or internal threats,
even zero-day attacks, by enforcing good behavior and preventing even
unknown application flaws from being exploited. AppArmor security policies
completely define what system resources individual applications can access,
and with what privileges.
A number of default policies are included with AppArmor, and using a
combination of advanced static analysis and learning-based tools, AppArmor
policies for even very complex applications can be deployed successfully in
a matter of hours. AppArmor is included with SUSE Linux.

*About Mick Bauer*
Mick Bauer, CISSP, is Linux Journal's security editor and an IS security
consultant in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He wrote Linux Server Security, 2nd
Ed. (O'Reilly & Associates, 2005).

Message-ID: <aa7f68510604200555y49ec13fdkb94cc1184aaad96e@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks for your attendance at the April Minneapolis/St Paul OWASP meeting.
Mick Bauer presented Novell AppArmor.
This included a dicussion of various flavors of secure UNIX,
Discretionary Access Controls (DAC) and Mandatory Access Controls (MAC).
Watch for his future columns on this topic in Linux Journal.
The slides are posted at:
http://apparmor.wiremonkeys.org

Two notable quotes:
"Compromising one application should not lead to compromising the entire
machine."
"Sometimes you are better off attempting less and
achieving more of it than attempting more and achieving little."
Thanks to Integral Business Solutions for the space and the pizza, "Papa
Johns".
Thanks also to Lorna for facilitating the discussion of Ira Winlker's book
Spies Among Us.

I will email the .jpg of the attendance list (for CISSP CPEs)
directly to those who signed in.

Suggestions for June meeting:
1. Meet again at Integral, Roseville.
2. Look at the second or third Tuesday, depending on speaker availability
3. Also discuss a presentation or paper that gets good interest on our
mailing list.
4. Possible topics:

- Cryptography (especially implementation blunders)
- PKI, authentication, authorization, SSO
- Open source web site generation tool (open source)
- Open source code analysis tools (ProofSecure)
- Report on OWASP/Belgium (Gunnar)
5. Discuss the prospect of a chapter project, like OWASP-based training and
exam questions.

More opportunities to contirbute:
If you can recommend a speaker or have additional suggestions post your
ideas to the list and we'll kick them around.
