"UMSA and Secure360 is proud to support the first annual Secure360 World
Run/Walk, a fun 5k/10k run/walk to benefit ECHO Minnesota, a leader in
multi-language health, safety, civic engagement and emergency readiness
communication. ECHO bridges the gap for immigrants and refugees in
Minnesota and will receive all net proceeds and charitable donations from
the race. We encourage all conference attendees to participate, but if you
are unable, you may still donate directly to ECHO Minnesota.

Sign-in for the run/walk starts at 5pm on Monday, May 7, at Upper Landing
Park in St Paul (near the River Centre). For full details, visit
http://secure360.org/secure360-runwalk-for-echo-2/. (Advance registration
required)"
