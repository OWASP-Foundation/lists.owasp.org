Hello World -

I am happy to announce that our next meeting will be September 9th and
Jeremiah Grossman from WhiteHat Security has agreed to join us and enlighten
us with his BlackHat 08 presentation, plus some goodies and new money making
stories he will be sharing with us.

Our September 3rd meeting has been canceled. Brian Chess from Fortify
Software will instead join us in our planned October 21st mini conference
which will be hosted at University of Minnesota. For this one day mini
conference we will have the participation of speakers such as Richard
Stallman founder of the Free Software Foundation, Jeff Williams Chair of the
OWASP Foundation and CEO of Aspect Security and Rohyt Belani from the
Intrepidus Group to mention a few.  We will post all the details soon once
we have all the details finalized. In the meantime, planned on attending
this one day mini conference set for October 21st at the UMN St. Paul
campus. There is also planning for a two day web penetration testing course
offered by the MN-ISSA and Rohyt Belani from the Intrepidus Group. Stay
tuned for more info!!!!!


 September OWASP Meeting -Jeremiah Grossman  *Topic Overview:*

Get Rich or Die Trying - Making Money on The Web, The Black Hat Way

Forget Cross-Site Scripting. Forget SQL Injection. If you want to make some
serious cash on the Web silently and surreptitiously, you don't need them.
You also don't need noisy scanners, sophisticated proxies, 0-days, or ninja
level reverse engineering skills -- all you need is a Web browser, a clue on
what to look for, and a few black hat tricks. Generating affiliate
advertising revenue from the Website traffic of others, trade stock using
corporation information passively gleaned, inhibit the online purchase of
sought after items creating artificial scarcity, and so much more.
Activities not technically illegal, only violating terms of service.

You may have heard these referred to as business logic flaws, but that name
really doesn't do them justice. It sounds so academic and benign in that
context when the truth is anything but. These are not the same ol' Web
hacker attack techniques everyone is familiar with, but the one staring you
in the face and missed because gaming a system and making money this way
couldn't be that simple. Plus IDS can't detect them and Web application
firewalls can't black them. If fact, these types of attacks are so hard to
detect (if anyone is actually trying) we aren't even sure how widespread
their use actually is. Time to pull back the cover and expose what's
possible.
 *Speaker Bio:*

Jeremiah Grossman is the founder and CTO of WhiteHat Security, considered a
world-renowned expert in Web security, co-founder of the Web Application
Security Consortium, and named to InfoWorld's Top 25 CTOs for 2007. Mr.
Grossman is a frequent speaker at industry events including the BlackHat
Briefings, RSA, ISACA, CSI, HiTB, OWASP, Vanguard, ISSA, Defcon, and a
number of large universities. He has authored dozens of articles and white
papers; is credited with the discovery of many cutting-edge attack and
defensive techniques; and is a co-author of XSS Attacks. Mr. Grossman is
frequently quoted in major media publications such as InfoWorld, USA Today,
PCWorld, Dark Reading, SC Magazine, SecurityFocus, CNet, SC Magazine, CSO,
and InformationWeek. Prior to WhiteHat he was an information security

	REMINDER
Message-ID: <59166a3d0808261317q5b65c8c4ydfdd387a523fdfa0@mail.gmail.com>

I just wanted to remind everyone to RSVP to the Sept 9th meeting. Below is
the link to RSVP. Please do not forget to do so, space is limited and this
event will sell out quickly.

RSVP -  http://www.go-integral.net/node/231

Also, I want to ask everyone for their support to our local chapter. We are
a non-profit organization and we rely on members and sponsors financial
support. We as local chapter have been able to offer great events and
opportunities at NOT COST. We have being doing O.K. so far thanks to the
support of the OWASP foundation, speakers and our faithful local sponsors
such Integral, the Center for Strategic IT & Security, Netspy and UMN to
mention a few. But if we want to continue to operate in the next year or so
and be able to continue to invite great speakers, we need your financial
support. Most speakers donate their time and travel expenses but there are
other great speakers in the academic and research world working on new and
very interesting security research, and most cannot pay for all of their
travel expenses. It would be great to be able to sponsor part of their
travel costs and offer this as an incentive if possible.

Where will your contributions/membership go?
They will go to operation expenses such as food and beverages, books
giveaway and events such the upcoming mini conference.

What benefits do you get?
Registering as a member you get  -
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Member_Offers as well as benefits mentioned
here http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership
We will recognize your support in our local page and meetings as well.

I don't have any money, I am broke same as OWASP MSP Chapter is. How can I
help?
Can't contribute financially? no problem, we can use your help and we will
recognize you for it. We as local chapter can use your help from time to
time with event logistics, promotion, finding sponsorship. If you have any
suggestions or ideas of how you would like to contribute shoot us an email.
We are open to any suggestions/comments. Get involved!

Perhaps, let me remind you that the OWASP Foundation offers grants for those
who contribute to security research/projects.  See
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Grants  - for more info.  There are
several interesting projects that could use our help check them out. Get
involved!

Thanks for your support!
