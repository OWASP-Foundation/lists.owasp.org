    Bruce Schneier will be presenting on "The Econimics of Information
Security" at OWASP's January meeting. Because we expect this to be a large

*Topic overview:*
The Economics of Information Security - Ten Trends
Surveying  current trends in information security, it's clear that a myriad
of forces are at work.

Fundamentally, security is all about economics: both attacker and defender
are trying to maximize the return on their investments. Understanding
economics is critical to understanding IT security; it explains why security
fails so often, and can offer new solutions for security success. For
example, often the people who could protect a system are not the ones who
suffer the costs of failure. Changing those economic incentives will do more
to improve security than  technology.
