Talk Title:  Web Application Cooking w/ PASTA - Process for Attack
Simulation and Threat Assessment
The attack landscape has changed and is too dynamic to apply one
dimensional strategies. Mitigation begins with planning and threat modeling
is a great and integrated way to enhance greater governance around security
via an integrated risk methodology such as PASTA, a risk centric or asset
centric threat modeling methodology.  Beyond simply attack enumeration and
countermeasure development planning, PASTA allows for threat modelers to
integrate security to a multitude of fractured security disciplines.
Today's shifting attack landscape requires planning as to who your
attackers are, what are they after, and why are they attacking you. The
methodology of PASTA will be covered and applied to web application
technologies for this discussion.

Talk Title:  OWASP WTE: Application Testing Your Way (tm)

OWASP WTE or Web Testing Environment is an OWASP project designed to make
application security tools and documentation easily available and easy to
use.  Starting out as the OWASP Live CD project, it has now grown into a
project which produces 31 packaged AppSec tools and pre-configured virtual
machines for VMware, VirtualBox and Parallels.  By creating individual
packages for security tools, it is now possible to create ala carte, on
demand installation of application security tools you need.  As a proof of
concept, there is a beta sub-project of WTE which demonstrated installing
WTE in the cloud allowing for easy remote testing.  In this talk, Matt will
cover the goals and history behind OWASP WTE as well as future developments
and plans.
