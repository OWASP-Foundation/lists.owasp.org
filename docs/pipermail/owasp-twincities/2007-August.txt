Subject: [Owasp-twincities] Next meeting is October 16 for Twin Cities OWASP
Message-ID: <aa7f68510708192105n1932dcbct635628e3c5a3ff12@mail.gmail.com>

There will be no August OWASP meeting. The next meeting will be October 16
(third Tuesday).

Topics and speakers are still being pulled together. We will meet at MNSCU,
downtown Minneapolis

Upcoming Events:
OWASP Conference, San Jose, Nov 12-17 www.owasp.org

*Question*:
Has anyone used the Web Hacking Incidents Database (WHID)?
I stumbled upon it at:
http://www.webappsec.org/projects/whid/
I have looked through the Data Loss Database (attrition.org) in the past and
that provided a good list of incidents to use in building the case for web
security.

Don't be shy, please post any issues or questions that arise to the list as
you see them.
Thanks,
Bob Sullivan, Chapter Leader
