I am going to do a talk on Intro to Web Hacking around WebGoat and
WebScarab tools. I invite everyone and anyone to come to this, this
is not just for uber-hackers, as all of us use web applications in
some form or another, eg: On-line Banking, Web based email, portals,
etc. I just want to make everyone aware that these common flaws still
exits, and this maybe a good place for some in-depth Q and A.

I am touting this as an interactive lesson, rather then a typical
stand up presentation. If you have questions I will be more then
willing to answer them, no mater then technical depth or breath.

We will also bring a newly acquired (donations are the best kind!)
CC terminal for folks to play with.

Please feel free to email us with any questions or request for this
or any future meeting topics. info at dc612 dot org
