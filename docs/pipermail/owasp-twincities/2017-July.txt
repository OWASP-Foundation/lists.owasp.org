OWASP MSP Welcomes one of our own for the August Chapter Meeting

Yan Kravchenko will speak about the Evolution of  Application Security.

 Description:

Application Security has become one of the most important frontiers for
protecting digital assets, and has effectively changed focus from
protecting network perimeters to ensuring security around dozens, hundreds,
or even thousands of applications.  Rapid growth of applications developed
in each organization is fueled by availability of data and rapid
development programming languages and platforms, which make it feasible to
create robust applications in a fraction of the time compared to even a few
years ago.  Combined with a wide range of development methodologies
(DevOps, Agile, Continuous Integration to name a few), challenges for
Application Security Programs have never been higher.

This session will cover some of the latest trends in increasing the
effectiveness of Application Security Programs, as presented and discussed
at the latest OWASP Summit in London.  Presentation will include upcoming
changes within several OWASP projects aimed at increasing ability to
measure, manage, and improve their Information Security Programs, while
forming stronger relationships with product owners and developers.

Bio:

As Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Mr. Kravchenko is responsible
for managing the Security and Compliance resources. He confronts the
evolving and ever present data security challenges facing Atomic Data and
its clients. Mr. Kravchenko brings more than 20 years of technology and
information security experience to Atomic Data, the last six of which he
served as compliance advisory practice lead at NetSPI. He primarily
addressed unique security and compliance challenges in the healthcare space
during that time. Additionally, Mr. Kravchenko has six years of experience
in the payment card industry as a practicing QSA. Mr. Kravchenko received a
B.S. degree in Information Systems Management from Regis University. He
also holds a wide array of industry certifications including CISSP, CSSLP,
