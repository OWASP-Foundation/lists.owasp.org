<PRE>I just wanted to remind everyone of tomorrow's meeting.  If you are a
developer or deploying any web application, you need to attend this. Please
bring lots of questions!!

 Tony Stieber &#8211; How NOT to Implement Encryption for the OWASP Top 10  Topic
Overview

Three out of the ten items in the OWASP Top Ten are related to encryption.
These items, A7, A8, and A9, are merely misuse or non-use of well-known and
readily available tools. Best practices will be explained and illustrated
with counter-examples with the goal of explaining how web applications and
cryptography meet.

12 years, with 8 of those years in the Fortune 100. His past experience
