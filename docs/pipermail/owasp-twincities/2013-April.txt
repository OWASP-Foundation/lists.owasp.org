Talk Title:  Top Ten Web Defenses

We cannot ?firewall? or ?patch? our way to secure websites. In the past,
security professionals thought firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
patching, and privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these
methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on prominent,
well-protected websites are occurring every day. Citigroup, PBS, Sega,
Nintendo, Gawker, AT&T, the CIA, the US Senate, NASA, Nasdaq, the NYSE,
Zynga, and thousands of others have something in common ? all have had
websites compromised in the last year. No company or industry is immune.
Programmers need to learn to build websites differently. This talk will
review the top coding techniques developers need to master in order to
build a low-risk, high-security web application.
