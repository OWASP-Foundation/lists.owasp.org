<PRE>Hello World!

I wanted to remind you once more about Secure360 conference next week May
13-14th. Also there are a few tracks offered the days after the conference
including a Oracle Security track. OWASP will have a booth sponsored by the
generous and always supportive folks of Integral. We will also speaking
about OWASP, our chapter's plans and upcoming projects our chapter will be
participating in such as the Enterprice Security API. Robert Sullivan and
Joe Teff and I will be delivering the presentation, stop by if you can!

Upcoming Events

DC612 meeting *TODAY Thursday*. If you have never been to any of these
meetings, I recommend good crowd and interesting discussions. For more
information check <A HREF="http://www.dc612.org/">http://www.dc612.org/</A>

*June 16th *
Tony Stieber will be speaking on &quot;How NOT to implement encryption for the *
OWASP* top 10&quot;. Bring lots of questions! Tony is hitting some very
interesting points.

*July 7th*
Gunnar Peterson from Arctec Group Consulting and Brian Chess from Fortify
Software will be presenting &quot;Breaking Web Services&quot;. They both gave this
talk at the past RSA conference. Another interesting topic don't forget to
bring lots of questions to this presentation as well.


In another note, I was privileged to attend the OWASP NYC/NJ meeting this
week where I met Tom Brenan who is in the national OWASP board and runs the
NYC/NJ chapter. Great crowd! I was proud to  see that for such  large city
and location the  amount of attendees was similar to ours.  Their crowd was
very diverse from web developers and web designers to InfoSec Engineers and
managers and business consultants.  NYC/NJ chapter and MSP chapter are
discussing the possibility of joining forces and setup a discussion panel to
discuss latest security trends and threats in the application security
world.  If you are interested in participating or sponsoring this event
please contact me or Lorna we really need everyone's support!

Thanks for your support!!
