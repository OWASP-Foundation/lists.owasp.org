<PRE>Occasionally we forward information regarding other security organization
meetings. We thought this one would be especially of interest. ISSA is
expecting a large turn out, so arrive early to ensure a good seat for the
presentations!

*Please join Marcus Ranum at the November MN ISSA meeting.   *

* *

*For this meeting, we will meet on the third Wednesday of November.  This is
a change from our normal meeting day.*

Speaker and Topic Information

*1st Presentation:* *Defcon 17 Highlights*

* *

*David Bryan, NetSpi* (CISSP)

*Abstract:*  This will be a review of a few of the popular topics and
presentations from this year&#8217;s Defcon 17 conference.   In this we will
outline new risks and threat vectors, such as how poorly browsers implement
TLS/SSL security, contest results, and other fun tidbits.





*2nd Presentation: **The problem with Pen Testing*



*Marcus Ranum, Chief Security Officer, Tenable Security*
*Abstract:*  Penetration testing certainly is a crowd-pleaser and, now, it's
required by significant industry standards such as PCI. There's a problem,
however, with the entire notion of penetration testing. In this
presentation, I will explain why penetration testing must evolve away from
its initial premise in order to become a really useful component of the
infosec practitioner's tool-set.
