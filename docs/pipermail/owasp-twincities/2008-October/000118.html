<PRE>*Don't forget to register for the MN OWASP Conference on October 21st being
held at the University of Minnesota, St. Paul Campus in the Theater of the
Student center. We're very excited out the line up of internationally known
speakers we were able to bring together for this one day of Application
Security talks. Jeff William's co-founder of OWASP will start off the
presentations which include: Arshan Dabirsiaghi, Anil Kumar Revuru from
Microsoft, Brian Chess from Fortify Software, Elliot Glazer from DTCC, Corey
Benninger from Itrepidus Group and Richard Stallman of the GNU project and
Free Software Foundation . The local MN OWASP chapter is hosting this event
which we've brought to you at a nominal fee of $25.00 per person which
includes continental breakfast and lunch.  Seating is limited and we expect
this event to sell out. On site registration the day of the event is not
expected to be available so please register prior to the event to guarantee
your seat!*
