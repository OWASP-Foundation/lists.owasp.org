<PRE>Hello World!

I just wanted to send a reminder to everyone about today's meeting. It
is a real honor and a privilege to host Andrew Van Der Stock. Andrew
is well known in the web application security world as well as the
OWASP community. He has been working on the OWASP Top Ten, The
Developer Guide and ESAPI to mention a few of the projects he has been
contributing to. I encourage you to stop by this evening and learn
more about the Developers Guide 3.0.  Check the table of contents so
you can see for yourself!

<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Guide_Table_of_Contents">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Guide_Table_of_Contents</A>

In another note, the OWASP mini conference details are here! We have
been working hard trying to make this mini conference available and
affordable to everyone. Unfortunately, admissions won't be free as I
was hoping to, there is just too much cost that we need to cover
(location, food, logistics) which made this impossible. The GOOD news
is that we will be able to provide a one day mini conference with
lunch included at a cost of $25!!!!! So for just $25 dollars you will
get access to the BOF event with will be during the luncheon and you
will be have the opportunity to interact and hear great speakers such
as Jeff Williams OWASP foundation Chair, Brian Chess Chief Scientist
and founder of Fortify Software, Richard Stallman President of the
Free Software Foundation, Anil Kumar Revuru who is responsible for
architecting the security tools at Microsoft to mention a few. So for
this price you are getting the opportunity to participate, get
involved and contribute funds to our local chapter.

Please check the mini conference page and see all the speakers and
presentations we are lining up for this event, you won't want to miss!
mark your calendars. If you did not get a chance to go to the NYC
OWASP conference here is your chance to see Jeff Williams talk on the
ESAPI project. This project is the next OWASP key project I encourage
you to check it out.
