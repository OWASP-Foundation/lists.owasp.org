  there is a Subway and a convenience store a couple of blocks down on Henn

 good presentation and turn out.\NMarch 16th OWASP Meeting –Dan Cornell\N
 Topic Overview: \NVulnerability Management in an Application Security Worl
 d\N\NIdentifying application-level vulnerabilities via penetration tests a
 nd code reviews is only the first step in actually addressing the underlyi
 ng risk. Managing vulnerabilities for applications is more challenging tha
 n dealing with traditional infrastructure-level vulnerabilities because th
 ey typically require the coordination of security teams with application d
 evelopment teams and require security managers to secure time from develop
 ers during already-cramped development and release schedules. In addition\
 , fixes require changes to custom application code and application-specifi
 c business logic rather than the patches and configuration changes that ar
 e often sufficient to address infrastructure-level vulnerabilities.\NThis 
 presentation details many of the pitfalls organizations encounter while tr
 ying to manage application-level vulnerabilities as well as outlines strat
 egies security teams can use for communicating with development teams. Sim
 ilarities and differences between security teams’ practice of vulnerabil
 ity management and development teams’ practice of defect management will
  be addressed in order to facilitate healthy communication between these g
 roups.\NSpeaker Bio: \NDan Cornell has over ten years of experience archit
 ecting\, developing and securing web-based software systems. As a Principa
 l of Denim Group\, he leads the organization's technology team overseeing 
 methodology development and project execution for Denim Group's customers.
  He also heads the Denim Group application security research team\, invest
 igating the application of secure coding and development techniques to the
  improvement of web based software development methodologies. He is also t
 he primary author of sprajax\, Denim Group's open source tool for assessin
 g the security of AJAX-enabled web applications. \NDate: Monday March 16\,
