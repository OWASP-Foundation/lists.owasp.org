DESCRIPTION:March OWASP Meeting –Dan Cornell\NTopic Overview: \NVulnerabi
 lity Management in an Application Security World\N\NIdentifying applicatio
 n-level vulnerabilities via penetration tests and code reviews is only the
  first step in actually addressing the underlying risk. Managing vulnerabi
 lities for applications is more challenging than dealing with traditional 
 infrastructure-level vulnerabilities because they typically require the co
 ordination of security teams with application development teams and requir
 e security managers to secure time from developers during already-cramped 
 development and release schedules. In addition\, fixes require changes to 
 custom application code and application-specific business logic rather tha
 n the patches and configuration changes that are often sufficient to addre
 ss infrastructure-level vulnerabilities.\NThis presentation details many o
 f the pitfalls organizations encounter while trying to manage application-
 level vulnerabilities as well as outlines strategies security teams can us
 e for communicating with development teams. Similarities and differences b
 etween security teams’ practice of vulnerability management and developm
 ent teams’ practice of defect management will be addressed in order to f
 acilitate healthy communication between these groups.\NSpeaker Bio: \NDan 
 Cornell has over ten years of experience architecting\, developing and sec
 uring web-based software systems. As a Principal of Denim Group\, he leads
  the organization's technology team overseeing methodology development and
  project execution for Denim Group's customers. He also heads the Denim Gr
 oup application security research team\, investigating the application of 
 secure coding and development techniques to the improvement of web based s
 oftware development methodologies. He is also the primary author of spraja
 x\, Denim Group's open source tool for assessing the security of AJAX-enab
 led web applications. \NDate: Monday March 16\, 2009\NTime: 5:30 p.m.\NLoc
