DESCRIPTION:June 29th OWASP Meeting – Cassio Goldschmidt\nTracking the prog
 ress of an SDL program: lessons from the gym\n\nMonday\, June 29th\, 2009\,
  6:00 p.m.\nForcing muscle growth is a long process which requires high int
 ensity weight training and high mental concentration. While the ultimate go
 al is often clear\, one of the greatest mistakes bodybuilders consistently 
 make is to overlook the importance of tracking their weight lifting progres
 s.\n\nLike a successful bodybuilding workout\, a security development lifec
 ycle program must consistently log simple to obtain\, yet meaningful metric
 s throughout the entire process. Good metrics must lack subjectivity and cl
 early aid decision makers to determine areas that need improvement. In this
  presentation we’ll discuss metrics used to classify and appropriately comp
 are security vulnerabilities found in different phases of the SDL by differ
 ent teams working in different locations and in different products. We’ll a
 lso discuss how to easily provide decision makers different views of the sa
 me data and verify whether the process is indeed catching critical vulnerab
 ilities internally.\n\n\nSpeaker Bio\nCassio Goldschmidt is senior manager 
 of the product security team under the Office of the CTO at Symantec Corpor
 ation. In this role he leads efforts across the company to ensure the secur
 e development of software products. His responsibilities include managing S
 ymantec’s internal secure software development process\, training\, threat 
 modeling and penetration testing. Cassio’s background includes over 12 year
 s of technical and managerial experience in the software industry. During t
 he six years he has been with Symantec\, he has helped to architect\, desig
 n and develop several top selling product releases\, conducted numerous sec
 urity classes\, and coordinated various penetration tests.\n\nCassio repres
 ents Symantec on the SAFECode technical committee and (ISC)2 in the develop
 ment of the CSSLP certification. He holds a bachelor degree in computer sci
 ence from Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio Grande Do Sul\, a masters
  degree in software engineering from Santa Clara University\, and a masters
  of business administration from the University of Southern California.\n \
