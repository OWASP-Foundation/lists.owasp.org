The Presentation:

Redefining Security Vulnerabilities: How Attackers See Bugs 

Developers see features, testers see bugs, and attackers see
"opportunities." Those opportunities are expanding beyond buffer overflows,
cross site scripting, etc. into logical bugs (and features) that allow
attackers to use the information they find to exploit trusting users. For
example, attackers can leverage a small information disclosure issue in an
elaborate phishing attempt. When you add people in the mix, we need to
reevaluate which "bugs" are actual security vulnerabilities. This talk is
loaded with real world examples of how attackers are using software
"features" and information tidbits (many of which come from bugs) to exploit
the biggest weakness of all: trusting users.

The Speaker:

Hugh Thompson

A world-renown application security expert, Thompson is also an Adjunct
Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University; Graduate Faculty
member in Applied Mathematics at Florida Institute of Technology; Advisory
Board member for the Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization; and Chief
Security Strategist at People Security (www.peoplesecurity.com
<http://www.peoplesecurity.com/> ).

Thompson has co-authored four books, more than 30 papers and 10

The Presentation:


Redefining Security Vulnerabilities: How Attackers See Bugs 


Developers see features, testers see bugs, and attackers see
"opportunities." Those opportunities are expanding beyond buffer overflows,
cross site scripting, etc. into logical bugs (and features) that allow
attackers to use the information they find to exploit trusting users. For
example, attackers can leverage a small information disclosure issue in an
elaborate phishing attempt. When you add people in the mix, we need to
reevaluate which "bugs" are actual security vulnerabilities. This talk is
loaded with real world examples of how attackers are using software
"features" and information tidbits (many of which come from bugs) to exploit
the biggest weakness of all: trusting users.
