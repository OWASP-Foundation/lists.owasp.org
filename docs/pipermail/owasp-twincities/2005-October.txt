Subject: [Owasp-twincities] Build Security In
Message-ID: <82E2A106-1193-49FE-8ACF-FA7258FD9914@arctecgroup.net>

The DHS portal Build Security In is now live

https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/portal/

The portal is a resource of best practices, templates, and artifacts  
for developers to write more secure code. I wrote two papers

Architectural Risk Assessment

architectural_risk_analysis/architectural_risk_assessment.xml

and Identity in Assembly and Integration

Subject: [Owasp-twincities] correction: meeting on Nov 8
Message-ID: <s35f4c0c.085@etcmail.mnscu.edu>

Apologies, I got my months confused. The meeting is scheduled for
November 8, 6-8 pm, at the Golden Valley Library.
http://www.hclib.org/AgenciesAction.cfm?agency=GV 

We agreed at the first meeting to meet the second Tuesday of the month.
In November, that would be the 8th.

Subject: [Owasp-twincities] minutes from October OWASP-TC meeting
Message-ID: <s35f4b72.080@etcmail.mnscu.edu>

I've attached the minutes from the October 11 meeting, compiled by Rich
Layer. (I  have modified them only slightly.) Unfortunately, only a few
people showed up and I am frankly impressed by Rich's ability to squeeze
any minutes whatsoever from the discussion. As the meeting was so
sparsely attended I did not actually present the OWASP Top Ten as
planned, but handouts are available at
http://afongen.com/talks/webappsec/2005/owasp-tc.zip 

Thanks to Wayne Ziebarth and webScurity for bringing pizza.

Our next meeting is currently scheduled for November 11, 6-8 p.m. at
the Golden Valley library (
http://www.hclib.org/AgenciesAction.cfm?agency=GV ). I am not sure
whether we have a meeting topic. Does anyone know?
