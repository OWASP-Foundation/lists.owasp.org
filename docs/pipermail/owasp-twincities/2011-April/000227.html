<PRE>Hi everybody. The replay of last night's meeting with Michael Coates
on Attack Aware Applications with AppSensor is available.

<A HREF="https://owasp.webex.com/owasp/ldr.php?AT=pb&amp;SP=MC&amp;rID=87764002&amp;rKey=14191b8f8c73dabc">https://owasp.webex.com/owasp/ldr.php?AT=pb&amp;SP=MC&amp;rID=87764002&amp;rKey=14191b8f8c73dabc</A>

Don't forget to register for the meeting this upcoming week on Monday,
April 25, 2011 if you haven't done so already - John Steven will be on
site in person discussing threat modeling. Spread the word to a
software architect you know!

DETAILS:

Date: Monday, April 25, 2011

Agenda:

OWASP MSP meeting.


The Presentation:

Threat Modeling (by example)

How will attackers break your web application? How much security
testing is enough? Do I have to worry about insiders? Threat modeling,
applied with a risk management approach, can answer both of these
questions if done correctly. This talk will present advanced threat
modeling step-wise through examples and exercises using the Java EE
platform and focusing on authentication, authorization, and session
management. Participants will learn, through interactive exercise on
real software architectures, how to use diagramming techniques to
explicitly document threats their applications face, identify how
assets worth protecting manifest themselves within the system, and
enumerate the attack vectors these threats take advantage of.
Participants will then engage in secure design activities, learning
how to use the threat model to specify compensating controls for
specified attack vectors. Finally, we'll discuss how the model can
drive security testing and validate an application resists specified
attack.

The Speaker:

John Steven

approaches, or to solidify ROI. John currently chairs the SD Best
Practices security track and co-edits the building security in
department of IEEE's Security and Privacy magazine. John has served on
numerous conference panels regarding software security, wireless
security and Java EE system development. He holds a B.S. in Computer
Engineering and an M.S. in Computer Science from Case Western Reserve
University.
