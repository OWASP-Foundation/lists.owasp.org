<PRE>My company, Ingenix, has a position open for a Senior IT Security
Analyst in our architecture core group.  We would like someone with a
software development background (Java or .NET preferred) and experience
with code review tools such as Fortify 360 SCA.  Experience with health
care IT governance (HIPAA, HITECH and ARRA) is a plus  The person who
fills this position would be working closely with myself and other
members of a small, focused architecture group in efforts to improve
software development process and tools for security concerns.
