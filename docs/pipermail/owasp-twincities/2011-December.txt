Subject: [Owasp-twincities] 2011 Toolsmith Tool of the Year
Message-ID: <4efd30eb.0123340a.6553.465c@mx.google.com>

Hi all,

if you have a moment, please show some support for a great OWASP tool.
Simon's presentation at AppSecUSA is located here: http://vimeo.com/32387480

If you'd like to hear more about the tool from the developer and check out
some of the other presentations from the conference.

Regards,

Lorna

 

 

 

 

Hi folks,

 

OWASP ZAP is one of the candidates for the 2011 Toolsmith Tool of the Year:

ar.html

Obviously winning this would be great for ZAP, but I think it would also be
great publicity for OWASP.

Nuff said?

 

Cheers,

 

Simon
