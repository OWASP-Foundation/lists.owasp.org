Subject: [Owasp-twincities] MinneSec meetup: Thursday 6pm Minneapolis
Message-ID: <aa7f68510707250904v63ab3aa3n10aac45f95361ba2@mail.gmail.com>

Hey OWASP folks, I see there is another way to meet up with other security
folks.

"The first MinneSec meetup for security geeks is this Thursday, July 26, 6pm
at the Local downtown Minneapolis. Informal and informational, not sales-y
and market-y. As with other CitySec's, you will not be expected to pay dues,
"join up", present a zero-day exploit, or defend your dissertation to
attend."

For directions check the blog at:

 The next OWASP meeting is scheduled for August 21.
