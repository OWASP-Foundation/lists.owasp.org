Talk Title: LEAN SECURITY

Abstract: For years, we've been told the key to security is technology. We
purchase and deploy technology to create layers behind layers, making our
walls taller and taller to keep the bad guys out. Sadly, it's not working.

What does work is combining lessons learned in other industries to the
security world. By examining best practices within Lean Manufacturing,
Agile Development and Rugged DevOps, this presentation delivers ways you
can be successful in security, not by purchasing technology, but by:

   - Effectively using what you have and what you can get for free
   - Re-allocating security budget from the point of diminishing return
   - Identifying and maximizing learning opportunities
   - Engaging in small, inexpensive test projects
   - Choosing custom and rational metrics to measure what matters
   - Replacing defective systems with ones that grow with you
   - Turning security from a catch-up game into one of strategic and
   competitive advantage.

 Success in security depends on the right mix of people, technology and
process. Without all three, you are doomed to failure.
