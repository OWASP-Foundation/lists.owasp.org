* to Concord, 509 2nd Avenue S, Hopkins MN 55343. Go to the Main Entrance
Lobby.

*Speaker:* Adam Baso

*Topic:* Application Security in a Nutshell

*Description:* Application security threats loom, but many teams are left
wondering what to do about it. Adam Baso will give a fast-paced tour of all
the stuff you need to know: a simple set of processes, common appsec bugs
and their fixes, and resources. Adam will also be seeking help from the
community for OWASP AppSec USA 2011 (www.appsecusa.org), which is being
hosted in Minneapolis September 20-23, 2011.

*Bio:* Adam loves software. He started on a single-line LCD BASIC system at
his cousin's house, graduated to Perl in the early years of the web,
hammered out lots of PHP for small gigs during college and after, and then
took on Java and .NET programming for geospatial applications before
teaching a C# course and pursuing his childhood dream of getting paid to
hack for the good guys. Adam passed the SCJP exam, and he holds a day job in
the Security Business Practice at Symantec as a Senior Security Consultant
in the field of software security, interacting daily with lots of fun
technology and people.
