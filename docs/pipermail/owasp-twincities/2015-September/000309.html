Technology Security Advisor
UnitedHealth Group - Eden Prairie, MN

Security is a market differentiator and critical business function and our customers are demanding excellence. An effective security program is driven from all areas of the business and technology. In this newly created Technology Security Advisor role, you will work in partnership with the Information Risk Management (IRM) Business Office Leader and the IRM Operations Leader to develop clear objectives, metrics and execution plans and deliver in accordance with the plans. You will share accountability with IRM to centralize security initiatives within the company, formalizing them as part of our common security strategy. As part of our commercial software delivery organization, you will develop and communicate security requirements to all involved stakeholders.

Specific responsibilities will include the following:
*  Represent the needs of our commercial software organization to IRM and ensure they provide appropriate solutions
*  Create a roadmap of security requirements that is aligned to our go-to-market strategy
*  Ensure incorporation of leading edge security capabilities into our product portfolio
*  Partner with IRM and the business operators to develop composite metrics and approved risk scores aligned to the business objectives for the segment
*  Work with the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) team to develop and execute communication plan for Business and IT leaders regarding PLM
*  Develop a financial plan to account for PLM; communicate this plan to IT and Business leaders; ensure that prioritized PLM activities are fully funded and scheduled (5-year plan)
*  Drive the remediation of the prioritized list of application vulnerabilities according to the timing requirements specified by IRM policy (if applicable)
*  Provide feedback to IRM to drive efficiency and clarity so that processes and communications can be improved
*  Partner with the IRM Communications team (Safe With Me) to communicate the importance and relevance of current events and changes to IRM policies within their respective organizations

*  Serve as the single point of contact for IRM into their respective organization to manage industry events, security process changes and incidents as appropriate
*  Serve as the single point of contact for IRM into their respective organizations for audit and compliance issues
*  Integrate Security into the technology development  and M&amp;A strategies; focus on getting that security ownership into the business, into those key critical applications that really run the business that are outside the infrastructure and core
*  Security education by commodity vertical - decompose the organization to create security education relevant to the business function. This means going from a one size fits all approach to tailored security education program customized to that unique business line - Finance, Clinical, Payer, Provider, etc.
*  Partner with IRM team to increase the IRM business acumen
*  Partner with the Office of the CIO team to ensure that funding is available as needed for vulnerability remediation and that the remediation work is scheduled into releases to meet the timing
*  Develop and execute a plan to reduce application vulnerabilities by understanding root cause and eliminating common cause (Note: IRM resources will partner with the TSL to provide root cause analysis assistance, training, education and support)
*  Own the monthly report for vulnerability remediation, tracking and progress toward elimination of vulnerabilities
*  Drive the execution of prioritized PLM work
*  Partner with the IRM Education team to identify gaps in the organization's knowledge of security policies and practices; develop and execute a plan to close the gaps

Requirements
*  Proven track record in the Security domain for commercial software products
*  15 + years' progressive experiences in a large, global, matrixed organization
*  Demonstrated ability to influence without authority
*  Proven cross-functional collaborator with strong interpersonal and communications skills
*  Well-honed writing and documentation skills, evidenced by the creation of clear requirements documents, roadmaps and presentations
*  Ability to build deep business acumen and institutional and organizational knowledge quickly
