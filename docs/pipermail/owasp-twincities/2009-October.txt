Subject: {dc612} Meeting Thursday October 8th -Lets Play with the Cold Boot Attack on  Encryption Keys


Kristi has started to explore the Cold Boot Attack on Encryption Keys
and has offered to invite us in to play.  We will be in the large
banquet room around 6ish to order food and drinks.  This will be a
hands on exploration of the vulnerability and method used to attack
encryption keys and retrieve data from memory.  It is an opportunity
to see where we can go with this as a group.  Bring your ideas,
experience and questions.

Heather

expecting a large turn out, so arrive early to ensure a good seat for the
presentations!

Speaker and Topic Information

*1st Presentation:* *Defcon 17 Highlights*

* *

*David Bryan, NetSpi* (CISSP)

*Abstract:*  This will be a review of a few of the popular topics and
presentations from this year?s Defcon 17 conference.   In this we will
outline new risks and threat vectors, such as how poorly browsers implement
TLS/SSL security, contest results, and other fun tidbits.





*2nd Presentation: **The problem with Pen Testing*



*Marcus Ranum, Chief Security Officer, Tenable Security*
*Abstract:*  Penetration testing certainly is a crowd-pleaser and, now, it's
required by significant industry standards such as PCI. There's a problem,
however, with the entire notion of penetration testing. In this
presentation, I will explain why penetration testing must evolve away from
its initial premise in order to become a really useful component of the
infosec practitioner's tool-set.
