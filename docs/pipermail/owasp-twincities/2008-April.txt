Subject: [Owasp-twincities] OWASP Next Meeting April 24th at 6 pm.
Message-ID: <E04C7F918DDAB6499780738EB6CBBA8501DC27C3@ibsmmem001.go-integral.net>

Next Meeting: 
Rohyt Belani from Intrepidus Group will be speaking on Phishing 2.0-The
Recipe to Owning Wall Street and Critical Infrastructure 
 
Abstract:
This presentation will discuss the evolution of phishing from being a
means of stealing user identities to becoming a mainstay of organized
crime. Today, (spear) phishing is a key component in a "hackers"
repertoire. It has been used to hijack online brokerage accounts to aid
pump 'n dump stock scams, and as a means of creating covert channels
from compromised user machines to the Internet. During this talk, I will
present the techniques used by attackers to execute such attacks and
real-world cases that I have responded to that will provide perspective
on the impact. This will be followed by a discussion on what works and
what doesn't in building and testing user awareness to thwart such
attacks against your organization.

Hello World!

*****  Reminder  ******

1) Rohyt Belani - Phishing 2.0 April 21st NOT April 24th. Mark you
calendars!  Rohyt is famous for this presentation and topic this should be
another interesting and rewarding meeting.

2) Secure360 May 13-14th. Our OWASP chapter will have an informational boot
here and we will also participate in the conference. Robert Sulivan, Joe
Teff and myself will be speaking about OWASP in one of the sessions. If you
are planning to participate in the conference stop by and show your support.
Rohyt Belani and Robert Hansen will comeback to MSP to participate in this
conference.  Also one of our local chapter members, Gunnar Peterson will be
speaking at this conference. Check the site for more information
http://www.secure360.org/

3) Security and Open Source Symposium will be held May 12th the day before
the conference. OWASP will be there to promote our local chapter and show
our support. If you are interested in participating at this event let us
know. Check the website for more information -
http://www.strategicit.org/secureos.shtml

We want to get our chapter more involved with OWASP projects. One project I
have volunteered our chapter to help the OWASP community with is the
Enterprise Security API -
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API.
Andrew Van Deer Stock expressed he would need help reviewing this project
and I offer our chapter to help. If you are interested contact me so we can
start communicating with project team leader and get going.

If there are any other projects you are interested in participating contact
me so I can pass the information to Paulo Coimbra OWASP project manager.

Thanks for your support!!

Kuai Hinojosa
OWASP (MSP) Chapter Leader.
