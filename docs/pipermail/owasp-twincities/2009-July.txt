Good Afternoon Twin Cities OWASPers,
I've put together a quick survey to get your opinion on a few possible
meeting topics for our July and September meetings. There is a section
for you to add your own suggestions as well . The survey is hosted
through SurveyMonkey and should only take a couple of minutes.  Please
take a few minutes before EOD on Thursday 7/9 to respond. Your
feedback helps us continue to address the topics which are most
relevant to you.

The survey is located here:

Thank you so much for your feedback.

Regards,

Speaker: Robert Sullivan

Robert Sullivan is a programmer, manager and security instructor.

For the last four years he has been minding the security posture for
200 websites at a large healthcare company.
Robert has contributed to the OWASP WebGoat project and is a past Twin
Cities chapter lead. The software development "hats" that he has worn
include developer, tester, manager, procurer, code reviewer,
penetration tester, trainer and auditor.

He's been educated (Wisconsin), certified (CISSP) and Culverized (Mocha Chip).

Presentation: "Open This First"
A job-oriented guide to software security resources.

Have you finally landed that job that requires you to know software security?
Before you set up your family photo and sign up for that health plan
you need to find the resources that will make you successful. We will
look at the Security Resource Guide together. This lookup tool will
guide you through all of the OWASP tools, documents and resources
based on your job, your goal and your urgency.

Join us for an interactive, light-hearted, fast-paced look at many
free and open tools. Live demonstrations of WebGoat, LiveCD, w3af and
ESAPI are planned.

What are the benefits of sponsorship of this event for my organization?
