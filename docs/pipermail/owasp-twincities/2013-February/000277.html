Talk Title:  OWASP WTE: Application Testing Your Way (tm)

OWASP WTE or Web Testing Environment is an OWASP project designed to make
application security tools and documentation easily available and easy to
use.  Starting out as the OWASP Live CD project, it has now grown into a
project which produces 31 packaged AppSec tools and pre-configured virtual
machines for VMware, VirtualBox and Parallels.  By creating individual
packages for security tools, it is now possible to create ala carte, on
demand installation of application security tools you need.  As a proof of
concept, there is a beta sub-project of WTE which demonstrated installing
WTE in the cloud allowing for easy remote testing.  In this talk, Matt will
cover the goals and history behind OWASP WTE as well as future developments
and plans.
