Talk Title:  Web Application Cooking w/ PASTA - Process for Attack
Simulation and Threat Assessment
The attack landscape has changed and is too dynamic to apply one
dimensional strategies. Mitigation begins with planning and threat modeling
is a great and integrated way to enhance greater governance around security
via an integrated risk methodology such as PASTA, a risk centric or asset
centric threat modeling methodology.  Beyond simply attack enumeration and
countermeasure development planning, PASTA allows for threat modelers to
integrate security to a multitude of fractured security disciplines.
Today's shifting attack landscape requires planning as to who your
attackers are, what are they after, and why are they attacking you. The
methodology of PASTA will be covered and applied to web application
technologies for this discussion.
