Robert,

 

Will you please distribute this announcement to your members?

 

Thanks- Mike Brown 

 

University of Minnesota-IP3, Inc. are hosting a 2 Day Executive IT
Seminar on security issues on June 5-6,2006. 

Our brand new Strategy to Reality '06: "Securing the Converged
Enterprise" is our most comprehensive forum yet! These are important and
extremely relevant security issues for any serious IT security
professional. The networks are converging - public/private,
wireless/wired, voice/data, VoIP and more. The data is converging too,
multi-media, SOA and the webification of everything. Finally, risk
management is a high-visibility board level concern forcing the
convergence of security management with risk management and law
enforcement.
