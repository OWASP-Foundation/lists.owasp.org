*Topics*:

If you are willing to present web security topics for any month please let
Bob Sullivan know.

These could include topics where there is an active tools market:
- Source Code Analysis
- Automated Web App. Testing
- Web App Firewalls
- XML Security

- Biometrics
- Cryptography

Also, it would be of great benefit to present something legislation or
industry specific:
- Homeland Security

- Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Compliance
- Sarbanes Oxley
- Grahm Leech Bliley
