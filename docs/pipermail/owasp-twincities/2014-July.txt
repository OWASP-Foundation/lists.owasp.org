OWASP Folks,

the Minnesota PHP User Group [1] is hosting a free presentation about

Hopefully you may find this helpful.

Minnesota Prompt: Devs and Depression

Wednesday, August 20, 2014,  6:30 PM


Speaker: Greg Baugues

Description:
  I am a developer, and I have bipolar and ADD. I failed out of school,
bounced from job to job, and for years I hid in shame from friends and
family. I thought I was a lazy bastard, squandering the talents and
opportunities that had been given to me. Recently I've discovered that I am
not alone in our industry. Mental illness runs rampant in the technical
community. Too many of our friends and colleagues are suffering, too
ashamed to ask for help because of the stigma of mental illness. We need to
talk about this more.
