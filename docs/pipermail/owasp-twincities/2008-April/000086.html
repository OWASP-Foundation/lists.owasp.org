<PRE>*Next Meeting: *
 *Rohyt Belani* from *Intrepidus Group* will be speaking on *Phishing 2.0-*The
Recipe to Owning Wall Street and Critical Infrastructure

*Abstract:*
This presentation will discuss the evolution of phishing from being a means
of stealing user identities to becoming a mainstay of organized crime.
Today, (spear) phishing is a key component in a &quot;hackers&quot; repertoire. It has
been used to hijack online brokerage accounts to aid pump 'n dump stock
scams, and as a means of creating covert channels from compromised user
machines to the Internet. During this talk, I will present the techniques
used by attackers to execute such attacks and real-world cases that I have
responded to that will provide perspective on the impact. This will be
followed by a discussion on what works and what doesn't in building and
testing user awareness to thwart such attacks against your organization.

*Date:* April 21th
*Time:* 6:00 pm
*Location:* Gourmet Dinning Room, MnScu
