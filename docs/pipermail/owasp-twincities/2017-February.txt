Welcome to the March 2017 OWASP MSP Chapter Meeting

We are pleased to present Girish Nair, who will speak about Instrumenting
Software and Software Security.

Abstract:

 In our physical world, we have instrumentation all around us. Clocks tell
us time, kitchen ovens tell us temperature, cars tell us speed, fuel level
and even has onboard health diagnostics. At our homes, we have security
alerts when someone trespasses our property or opens a door. However, in
the world of software, we have very little visibility into what is going on
inside the software. Our presenters will describe how instrumentation can
be used to enable your software applications to both detect vulnerabilities
and block attacks. Furthermore, they will demonstrate the insights offered
by using instrumentation and why this approach can offer add speed to your
development cycle while improving the context and accuracy of
vulnerabilities to your security program.

Bio:

Girish Nair has been a software developer for more than two decades. He has
special interest in web related technologies and application security. He
has a Master?s degree in computer science, and is a CISSP. He currently
works for Contrast Security, where he evangelizes their technology.

Registration is required.
