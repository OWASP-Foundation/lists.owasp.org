The Presentation:


Redefining Security Vulnerabilities: How Attackers See Bugs 


Developers see features, testers see bugs, and attackers see
&quot;opportunities.&quot; Those opportunities are expanding beyond buffer overflows,
cross site scripting, etc. into logical bugs (and features) that allow
attackers to use the information they find to exploit trusting users. For
example, attackers can leverage a small information disclosure issue in an
elaborate phishing attempt. When you add people in the mix, we need to
reevaluate which &quot;bugs&quot; are actual security vulnerabilities. This talk is
loaded with real world examples of how attackers are using software
&quot;features&quot; and information tidbits (many of which come from bugs) to exploit
the biggest weakness of all: trusting users.
