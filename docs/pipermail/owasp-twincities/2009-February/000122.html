Finally! Our 1st meeting of 2009 will be on February 16th at 6pm. 

February OWASP Meeting -Rick Ensenbach

Topic Overview:

Proactive Lifecycle Security Management
Security Authorization Process Overview

Security professionals are often faced with the daunting task of 
having to retrofit security controls into systems after it has 
already been put into production. The bad news is that this commonly 
occurs after sensitive or confidential information has been exposed 
as a result of a preventable system vulnerability, which often leads 
to public embarrassment, unnecessary litigation, regulatory fines, 
loss of customer confidence and numerous man-hours spent performing 
incident response and breach notification activities.

Attend this session and learn how to ensure that security is 
addressed early in the system development/acquisition process by 
implementing a simple, scalable process that Federal agencies and the 
Department of Defense have practiced for years. You will also learn 
how this process can help with other regulatory and industry 
compliance requirements such as Payment Card Industry, Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Sarbanes-Oxley and 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley.

Mr. Ensenbach will also discuss available resources you can use and 
provide and example of a &quot;System Security Plan&quot; that you can 
immediately start using in your own organization and get you started 
on implementing your own security authorization process.

This is a &quot;must&quot; attend session for all organizations that are 
required to comply with Federal Information Security Management Act 
(FISMA).
