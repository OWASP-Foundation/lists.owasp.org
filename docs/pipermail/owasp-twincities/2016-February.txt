Welcome to OWASP MSP in 2016

Our March Chapter meeting is scheduled for March 8th.

We welcome Matt Tesauro: Matt Tesauro is the Senior Software Security
Engineer at Pearson and was previously the Senior Product Security Engineer
at Rackspace.  He is also an Adjunct Professor for the University of Texas
Computer Science department teaching the next generation of CS students
about Application Security.  Matt is broadly experienced information
security professional of 15 years specializing in application and cloud
security. He has also presented and provided trainings at various
international industry events including DHS Software Assurance Workshop,
OpenStack Summit, SANS AppSec Summit, AppSec US, EU and LATAM.  His work
has included security consulting, penetration testing, threat modeling,
code reviews, training and teaching at the University of Texas and Texas
A&M University. He is a former board member of the OWASP Foundation and
project lead for OWASP AppSec Pipeline & WTE project - a collection of
application security testing tools.  He holds two degrees from A&M
University and several security and Linux certifications.

Doing App Sec at Scale -

How many applications are in your company?s portfolio? What?s the headcount
for your AppSec team? Whatever your situation is, I am sure the numbers are
not in your favor. Its not time to find a new career, it?s time to up your
game. This talk will cover how to take your small merry band of AppSec
professionals and scale it up to a virtual army. By taking the best of
DevOps, Agile and CI/CD, you can iteratively up your AppSec game over time
and begin your ascent out of the security hole you are in.

The talk covers real world experiences running AppSec groups at two
different companies. Rackspace with approximately 4,000+ employees and
Pearson with 40,000+. Both have an international presence and far more apps
and developers that AppSec staff. The talk covers the key principles to
speed and scale up AppSec programs as well as practical examples of these
practices put into use. Example results? How about under a minute to
provision recurring static scanning of an application? How about 24/7
remediation advice available to any developer ? even while you sleep.
Report generation ? in minutes. Automation, Orchestration, ChatOps, its all
in our AppSec Pipeline. Start early and begin to buy down the technical
security dept which feels inevitable using traditional AppSec program
thinking.
