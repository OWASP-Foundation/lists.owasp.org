<PRE>Tonight's meeting will focus on Post DEFCON events, and general fun stuff that people experienced. We will be bringing prototypes of possible DC612 shirts and stickers to get feedback from the group and we can start to take orders for these if people are interested. Lock boards will also be provided, if people want to play with them, and I'll bring some shiny new toys too. 

The meeting will be in the Large Banquet room in the back of the building. The space is free of charge for us, so we only ask that people come and order food or drinks to help support the space, and DC612. 

Agenda: 
6pm - Order food and drinks 
7pm - Post DEFCON events and items 
SWAG - DC612 Shirts &amp; Stickers 
WIRED Blog 
Etc... 
8:30pm - Mini-CTF Discussions 
9pm - wrap up 

There will also be some talks around DC612 Mini-CTF (Capture The Flag), but no official announcements just yet. 

New Item: We have also created a DC612 Twitter account, so please feel free to follow, and RT our posts. 

Elsie's is located in North East Minneapolis , just across the river from down town. 
Directions: Google Maps 

Basically take 94 West / East to the Broadway Exit, turn onto Broadway headed East and cross the river ( if you head towards the fast food/taco bell you have gone the wrong way), once across the river bridge take a right on Marshall (Heading south) to 729 Marshall (on the left just after 8th street). There is plenty of free parking in back and on the side streets. 
Metro Transit: University and 2nd St Ne are just a few blocks away, and has regular bus service. 

For more information or, if you would like to present on a topic please feel free to send an email to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-twincities">info at dc612.org</A>, speakers will receive a free meal, drink and cool swag. 

Hope to see you there!
