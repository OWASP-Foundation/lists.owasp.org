Subject: November DC612 Meeting, CTF, Multiboot Thumb Drives, and Interciptor.

Good morning!  This week is DC612, Thursday November 12th we will be exploring several topics that include, CTF, USB Multiboot drives, and the Interceptor tool on a Router Station Pro.  This will be a chance for people to create their own bootable USB drives, and have some fun!

CTF

We will have a sign up sheet at the meeting, and create a mailing list for the Red Team/CTF events.  We will also be looking for volunteers to teach a few clasess, such as NMAP, Nessus, Metasplot, etc&#8230;

Interceptor

Interceptor is a script and hardware to capture wired traffic and send it unmodified over a wireless connection.  The script was created by DigiNinja and it allows any OpenWRT device to be come a virtually transparent network sniffer.  This means once the device is set, I can watch the wired network traffic from outside the building, over the wireless.  I&#8217;ll give a quick intro, and demo on the Router Station Pro hardware and Interceptor tools.

USB Multiboot

Have you ever had a really large USB stick (8 or 16GB) however you can only use backtrack or Bart&#8217;s PE as the boot loader wants to take over?  Me too.  We will show you how you can have dozens of operating systems on one USB drive, and boot all of them with ease!  This topic idea came to us from Hak5, and everyone can participate!  So bring your thumb drives (4GB or bigger is best), make sure that you backup or wipe the drive before the meeting just in case, as we will have a computer with a plethora of bootable ISOs and OSes for people to tryout.

Meeting Registration
