<PRE>Fyi, there is a Team OWASP on Kiva (*), it was started by James  
McGovern. There are currently 23 members (including several Twin  
Cities folks), and the team has made over $7,800 worth of microloans.

* You can go to Kiva's website and lend to someone across the globe  
who needs a loan for their business - like raising goats, selling  
vegetables at market or making bricks. Each loan has a picture of the  
entrepreneur, a description of their business and how they plan to use  
the loan so you know exactly how your money is being spent - and you  
get updates letting you know how the entrepreneur is going.

The best part is, when the entrepreneur pays back their loan you get  
your money back - and Kiva's loans are managed by microfinance  
institutions on the ground who have a lot of experience doing this, so  
you can trust that your money is being handled responsibly
