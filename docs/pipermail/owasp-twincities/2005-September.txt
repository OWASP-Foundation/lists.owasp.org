Our first meeting will be next week, at the Golden Valley library from
6 to 8PM on
Tuesday, September 13th - note the date change.  We will need to wrap
up around 7:45, so that we can get the meeting room cleaned up and be
out of the building by 8 when they close.

Agenda is as follows:

  * mechanics - how often should we meet, where, who can we con into
buying us pizza
  * meeting topics  & speakers - it would be nice if we could map out
6 - 12 months of topics, and assign facilitators for each meeting
  * how can we contribute to OWASP as a whole?  what are other
chapters doing along those lines?

See you all next week!  Those of you who can't make it, please share
your ideas on any of the above topics via the mailing list.  I will
post a summary of the meeting to the list sometime late next week.

Only three days (OK, 2.4) left for early-bird registration.  Note also
that if you show up planning to register on-site, you'll be out of
luck.

Hi Chapter Leads!

Below is a note from Dave Wichers about the OWASP AppSec Conference.
Could you remind your chapters that the early-bird registration ends
this Friday?

Also, as chapter leads, you're official members of OWASP and can
register for the member price of $250.

--Jeff

-----------------------------

I just wanted to remind everyone that early registration for the OWASP
conference ends on Sept 9th (this Friday). On Sept 10. the registration
fee
will increase by $50 for both Standard and Government registrants. Full
details on the conference are available at:
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005dc.html

Also, I have been informed by the staff at NIST that there will be NO
ONSITE
REGISTRATION. Thus, you must register for the conference by Oct 10th via
the
website. We then have to provide a list of registrants to the Guards at
NIST. You will be required to provide them with picture ID. If you are
on
the registration list, they will then let you enter the facility to the
conference building where you can pick up your conference badge.

Also, the training class on Oct 10, the day before the conference, is
almost
full so I encourage anyone interested in signing up to do so soon. If
there
are enough registrants over the course max, we might open up a second
offering of the class at the same date and location. However, we need to
decide this soon so we can reserve the room. So please register for the
course as soon as possible if you are interested to ensure you get a
spot.

Registration info from previous announcements repeated below:

REGISTRATION DETAILS: As a non-profit charitable organization, and with
NIST's sponsorship, OWASP has been able to keep the cost to $300 per
seat if
you are able to register prior to Sept. 10, 2005. The cost to government
employees is only $250 prior to Sept. 10th.

Registration information is available at:
http://www.owasp.org/docroot/owasp/Registration/index.jsp

PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL TICKETS ARE NON REFUNDABLE TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATION
COSTS

FOUNDATIONS OF APPLICATION SECURITY COURSE - Oct 10: OWASP has arranged
to
have a one-day hands on Web Application Security training course the day
prior to the conference. This one day class will be held at the nearby
Holiday Inn and is only $600 for conference attendees. Registration for
this
course can be done via the conference registration page.

More details on this training course is available at:
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005dc/training.html

EVENING SOCIAL EVENT - Oct 11: An optional dinner event is being held at
the
Holiday Inn Gaithersburg, which is the same location where the training
is
to be held on the 10th, and where discounted rooms are being made
available
to all conference attendees (see Accommodations below).

This event involves a dinner at the hotel from 7-9 PM, followed by
drinks at
O'Malley's Irish Pub right in the hotel or out by the hotel's indoor
pool
adjacent to the pub. We hope to see all of you there as this is a great
chance to mingle and meet many members of the OWASP community.

Please contact me with any questions. Looking forward to seeing you all
there!

Thanks, Dave

Dave Wichers, OWASP Conferences Chair
The OWASP Foundation
