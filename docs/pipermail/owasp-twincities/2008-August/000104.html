<PRE>I just wanted to remind everyone to RSVP to the Sept 9th meeting. Below is
the link to RSVP. Please do not forget to do so, space is limited and this
event will sell out quickly.

RSVP -  <A HREF="http://www.go-integral.net/node/231">http://www.go-integral.net/node/231</A>

Also, I want to ask everyone for their support to our local chapter. We are
a non-profit organization and we rely on members and sponsors financial
support. We as local chapter have been able to offer great events and
opportunities at NOT COST. We have being doing O.K. so far thanks to the
support of the OWASP foundation, speakers and our faithful local sponsors
such Integral, the Center for Strategic IT &amp; Security, Netspy and UMN to
mention a few. But if we want to continue to operate in the next year or so
and be able to continue to invite great speakers, we need your financial
support. Most speakers donate their time and travel expenses but there are
other great speakers in the academic and research world working on new and
very interesting security research, and most cannot pay for all of their
travel expenses. It would be great to be able to sponsor part of their
travel costs and offer this as an incentive if possible.

Where will your contributions/membership go?
They will go to operation expenses such as food and beverages, books
giveaway and events such the upcoming mini conference.

What benefits do you get?
Registering as a member you get  -
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Member_Offers">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Member_Offers</A> as well as benefits mentioned
here <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership</A>
We will recognize your support in our local page and meetings as well.

I don't have any money, I am broke same as OWASP MSP Chapter is. How can I
help?
Can't contribute financially? no problem, we can use your help and we will
recognize you for it. We as local chapter can use your help from time to
time with event logistics, promotion, finding sponsorship. If you have any
suggestions or ideas of how you would like to contribute shoot us an email.
We are open to any suggestions/comments. Get involved!

Perhaps, let me remind you that the OWASP Foundation offers grants for those
who contribute to security research/projects.  See
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Grants">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Grants</A>  - for more info.  There are
several interesting projects that could use our help check them out. Get
involved!

Thanks for your support!
