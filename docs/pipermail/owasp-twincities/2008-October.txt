Hello World!

I just wanted to send a reminder to everyone about today's meeting. It
is a real honor and a privilege to host Andrew Van Der Stock. Andrew
is well known in the web application security world as well as the
OWASP community. He has been working on the OWASP Top Ten, The
Developer Guide and ESAPI to mention a few of the projects he has been
contributing to. I encourage you to stop by this evening and learn
more about the Developers Guide 3.0.  Check the table of contents so
you can see for yourself!

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Guide_Table_of_Contents

In another note, the OWASP mini conference details are here! We have
been working hard trying to make this mini conference available and
affordable to everyone. Unfortunately, admissions won't be free as I
was hoping to, there is just too much cost that we need to cover
(location, food, logistics) which made this impossible. The GOOD news
is that we will be able to provide a one day mini conference with
lunch included at a cost of $25!!!!! So for just $25 dollars you will
get access to the BOF event with will be during the luncheon and you
will be have the opportunity to interact and hear great speakers such
as Jeff Williams OWASP foundation Chair, Brian Chess Chief Scientist
and founder of Fortify Software, Richard Stallman President of the
Free Software Foundation, Anil Kumar Revuru who is responsible for
architecting the security tools at Microsoft to mention a few. So for
this price you are getting the opportunity to participate, get
involved and contribute funds to our local chapter.

Please check the mini conference page and see all the speakers and
presentations we are lining up for this event, you won't want to miss!
mark your calendars. If you did not get a chance to go to the NYC
OWASP conference here is your chance to see Jeff Williams talk on the
ESAPI project. This project is the next OWASP key project I encourage
you to check it out.

Folks, I apologize, but the microphone fell down during the OWASP  
presentation tonight and I didn't notice it until it was too late.  
Thus, there will be no video for tonight's presentation. I apologize  
for the various problems with the videos so far. I will be ironing out  
any remaining kinks once and for all hopefully with the next  
presentation.

I encourage you to watch the keynote speech from last week's OWASP USA  
application security conference in NYC -

Dave Wichers, as well as several others, touched on several of the  
topics that Andrew van der Stock entertainingly covered this evening.

8:00 - 9:00

Registration





9:00 ? 9:30 am

Kuai Hinojosa

OWASP MN President

Conference introduction

9:30 ? 10:30 am

Jeff Williams

CEO, Aspect Security
OWASP founder; Chair, OWASP Foundation

Application security is getting more complicated every day with increasing
connectivity, more mixing of code and data, more parsers, more interpreters,
more assets, and more functionality available. We have to take steps now to
simplify the problem. So if you're tired of securing one application at a
time, and wrestling with the same vulnerabilities again and again,
establishing your organization's ESAPI is one of the best things you can do.

10:30 ? 11:00 am

Arshan *Dabirsiaghi*

Director of Research, Aspect Security

Many of the challenges we face in application security could be solved at an
architectural layer without trying to accomplish the impossible task of
fixing millions of websites with billions of lines of code behind them. The
OWASP Intrinsic Security Working Group is a new OWASP effort focused on
addressing root causes of application security problems and fixing them
where it's easiest.

11:00 - 12:30

Lunch





12:30 - 1:30 pm

Anil Kumar Revuru

Microsoft

Microsoft Connected Information Security Framework (CISF) and Tools
Description: The Connected Information Security Group, part of Microsoft
internal Information Security organization are working on a technology
framework and set of applications to support corporate information security
management programs. This presentation provides a short overview of the
problem space and current thinking on our approach to solving it.

1:30 - 2:30 pm

Brian Chess

Fortify Software

Creating secure code requires more than just good intentions. Programmers
need to know how to make their code safe in an almost infinite number of
scenarios and configurations. Static source code analysis gives users the
ability to review their work with a fine tooth comb and uncover the kinds of
errors that lead directly to vulnerabilities. This talk frames the software
security problem and shows how static analysis is part of the solution.

2:30 - 3:00 pm

Break





3:00- - 4:00 pm

Elliot Glazer

DTCC

Information Security Architecture Layers and Key Processes
Information Security Architecture is driven by an Information Security
Strategy and Principles. It is also critical the architecture support the
Business Strategy:
Security Functional Architecture
Security Technical Architecture
Security Reference Architecture
Security Technology Lifecycle
Security Program Implementation Planning

4:00 ? 5:00 pm

Corey Benninger

Intrepidus Group

Exploring the how poor application security mixed with a phishing is leading
to a costly cocktail of disaster. This talk will go over real world examples
of phishing attacks that have taken advantage of cross site scripting flaws,
SQL injection vulnerabilities, session fixation attacks, and others web
application flaws. Learn what phishers are doing to take their attacks to
the next level by chaining multiple vulnerabilities together. The
presentation will also share resources that help to track phishing trends
and research

5:00 ? 5:15 pm

Richard Stallman
