Application Centric Identity management - What does this mean?

We will talk about how applications (especially externally facing web
applications) need to be identity aware. What are the options, how
technology is solving this issue.

CISSP Exam Item Writing:
The CISSP certification is shaping our field. The CISSP exam is painfully in

discuss and write exam items for the CISSP exam. We'll have the guidelines
and a stack of reference books available.

CISSP Reivew class.
