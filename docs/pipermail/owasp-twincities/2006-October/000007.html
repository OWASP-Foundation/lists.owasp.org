We will talk about how applications (especially externally facing web
applications) need to be identity aware. What are the options, how
technology is solving this issue.

CISSP Exam Item Writing:
The CISSP certification is shaping our field. The CISSP exam is painfully in

discuss and write exam items for the CISSP exam. We'll have the guidelines
and a stack of reference books available.

CISSP Reivew class.
