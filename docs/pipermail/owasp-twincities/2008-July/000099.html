<PRE>The link to the streaming video of Tony Stieber's encryption presentation at the June meeting is on the chapter page at

    <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Minneapolis_St_Paul">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Minneapolis_St_Paul</A>

This video, as well as several others, can also be found on the OWASP videos node at

    <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Video#Videos">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Video#Videos</A>

Here's a direct link to the video:

    <A HREF="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2189031826020259616&amp;hl=en">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2189031826020259616&amp;hl=en</A>

A few notes on the video:

    -Sound quality is a little lacking, but passable. I purchased a wireless microphone setup to hopefully remedy this in the future, but it turns out the Aiptek camera needs a little surgery to use a microphone of one's choosing - at least it looks like it's possible from a search on the web for mods. Anyone handy with soldering? I'm not worried about the camera breaking during soldering, so anyone who can lend some free time and soldering talent in the name of better sounding OWASP presentations, please e-mail me.

    -The video is a little warped because it was uploaded at an HD 16:9 ratio, and Google Video plays back at a 4:3 ratio. I'll try to record in 4:3 going forward, but this video and the one from Gunnar Peterson's were recorded in HD 16:9. Any thoughts on free Mac software for doing a conversion from HD 16:9 to 4:3 with letterboxing?

I'm currently uploading the video of the Gunnar Peterson presentation on SOA security from last night, and will post up the link and a message once complete.
