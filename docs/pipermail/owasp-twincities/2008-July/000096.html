 Topic Overview

SOA and Web services promise wonderful interoperability, but distributed
systems create lots of room for fantastic failures. This session will
explore the gory details of unique vulnerabilities at each layer of the SOA
stack - from the WSDL interfaces to XML processing (XSD, XPath and XQuery),
to the implementation languages liike Java and C#, to new security standards
like WS-Security and SAML.

Gunnar gave this talk with Brian Chess at the 2008 RSA
Conference&lt;<A HREF="https://cm.rsaconference.com/US08/catalog/controller/catalog">https://cm.rsaconference.com/US08/catalog/controller/catalog</A>&gt;
.

Gunnar was also interviewed by Gary McGraw:

&quot;On the 27th episode of The Silver Bullet Security Podcast, Gary McGraw
interviews software security expert Gunnar Peterson, a Managing Principal at
Arctec Group. Gary and Gunnar begin with the age-old question, &quot;What is
security?&quot; They go on to discuss how Web 2.0 and SOA security is
progressing, the big idea behind &quot;federated identity,&quot; whether all market
verticals can follow the software security lead of the financial services
industry, and the inherent badness of the color purple.&quot;
