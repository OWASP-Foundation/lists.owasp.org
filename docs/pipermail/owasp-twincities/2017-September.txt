OWASP MSP Welcomes Greg Anderson for the October Chapter Meeting

Greg Anderson will speak about the OWASP Project - DefectDojo Tool

Description:

DefectDojo was created in 2013 when one security engineer at Rackspace
stupidly opened his mouth in front of his leadership team. Vulnerability
management is traditionally tedious, time consuming, and mentally draining.
DefectDojo attempts to streamline vulnerability management with automation
centered around templating, report generation, metrics, scanner
consolidation, and baseline self-service tools. DefectDojo is currently
used by multiple large enterprises and has twenty contributors. It has made
several engineers' lives much easier, and it can help you too. Got a ton of
findings to consolidate and report on? DefectDojo has you covered. Need to
have a dashboard of your team?s work? DefectDojo has you covered. Tired of
boilerplate report generation? DefectDojo does that for you. Come check out
how to make vulnerability management less painful and speed up your appsec
program in this talk with demo.

Bio:

Greg Anderson is the project leader and creator of OWASP DefectDojo. Greg
was also a chapter leader of San Antonio for two years.  His recent work
has focused on advanced security automation to get the most out of
application security programs.
