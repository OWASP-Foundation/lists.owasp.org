SPEAKER: Gene Kim
PRESENTATION: Infosec In The New World Order: Rugged DevOps and More...

DATE &amp; TIME
November 7, 2011
6:00 PM - 8:00 PM (speaker at 6:30 PM)

LOCATION
Minneapolis Community and Technical College
1501 Hennepin Ave S
Management Education Center M1600
Minneapolis MN 55403

DESCRIPTION
While most IT shops struggle with monthly releases, agile IT
businesses routinely conjure thousands of AWS servers, performing over
10 deploys per day. In this talk, Gene will present key findings of
his 10 years of research of high performing IT operations and security
organizations, and his recent research on the DevOps movement. He'll
talk about why he believes DevOps is so important to addressing the
dysfunctional marriage between IT and the business, and seven things
security must do to survive and thrive in this new regime.

BIO
Since 1999, Gene Kim has been studying and benchmarking high
performing IT operations and information security organizations.  He
was the founder of Tripwire, and served as CTO there for 13 years.  He
wrote the &quot;Visible Ops Handbook,&quot; which codified how organizations
transformed from &quot;good to great.&quot;
