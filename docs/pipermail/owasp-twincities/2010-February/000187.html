<PRE>Since your chapter got an early preview of my plans for the OWASP Live
CD, I wanted to share this post I just sent to the OWASP Live CD List.

Apologies if this is a cross-post and you're seeing this for the second
time.

If you have feedback, consider posting it to the forums at
AppSecLive.org.  Complaints, bugs or praise are welcome ;)

A quick update to let everyone know that the conversion to Ubuntu is
complete.  There is a beta release (in the sense that Gmail was a beta)
available for download now as an .iso plus VirtualBox &amp; VMware images.

Get them now and enjoy the new Ubuntu goodness.  You can get yours here:
<A HREF="http://www.appseclive.org/content/downloads">http://www.appseclive.org/content/downloads</A>

The current release was created to be equivalent to the AppSec EU
release in terms of tools with the exception of WebGoat which was
delayed by a re-write of WebGoat Manager.  Yup, that's 27 .debs just
waiting for you to enjoy!

The OWASP Live CD is a sub-project of OWASP WTE aka OWASP Web Testing
Environment.  The name change is to account for the ever growing methods
we're creating to get great tools and documents into your hands.  OWASP
WTE currently includes the .iso and virtual installs mentioned above.
Additionally, look for bootable DVDs, USB installs, and for those that
run Ubuntu natively, we'll have a Debian repository too.

There's tons of cool tweaks and upgrades in this beta so look for
several blog posts to appear over the next couple of weeks on
AppSecLive.org going into details on the goodness that awaits you.

For those that just can't wait or are just the curious sort, we've got a
Google Code site here:
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/owasp-wte/">http://code.google.com/p/owasp-wte/</A>

where you can checkout the cool new stuff like the bash script to launch
WebScarab:

More on the WebScarab package in a blog post to come.

Cheers!
