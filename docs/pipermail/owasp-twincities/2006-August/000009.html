<PRE>I have an identity management SME that could present. Might not be for a few
months. Do you have any specific topics or angle that you would like to see?

Subject: [Owasp-twincities] October meeting ideas

Thank you all for the meeting last night. Thanks especially to Pete Palmer
for his presentation on crypto and Apache configuration with SSL/TLS. I've
been out of daily Apache administration for a while; it was refreshing to
feel back in that element, if only briefly. And of course, thanks again to
Lorna for the food.

We left the meeting with an inclination to meet at the same place in
October, but without a clear agenda. I'll throw a few ideas on the table,
including what I remember from suggestions last night.

* Web services security.
* Identity management. No, no more specific than that. It's wide open,
people.
* In my talk last night I mentioned the new spate of JavaScript malware and
newly understood dangers of cross-site scripting. I'd be willing to about
that in greater detail. I could even be a less obviously hopped up on
caffeine. :)
* Platform-specific web app security. Java EE, .NET, PHP...
* HTTP Request Smuggling, Response Splitting
* Log management
* Any of the OWASP projects
* SiteGenerator
* Phishing
* Security metrics
* Discuss a chapter of the OWASP Guide.

An updated OWASP Top Ten is scheduled for release at the end of the year. I
suggest that we slate some time to discuss that in February.

So. Thoughts? More ideas? Takers?
