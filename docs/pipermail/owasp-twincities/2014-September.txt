Subject: [Owasp-twincities] Cigital is Hiring - Minneapolis
Message-ID: <E347AB7F22FC9846B92D3C39D06445431CF03CD97C@dcmbx07.cigital.com>


We're growing throughout the Midwest and as a result we have some new full-time opportunities in Minneapolis.

Cigital is the worlds largest largest consulting firm specializing in software security and is the global leader in helping organizations design, build, and maintain secure software.

Over the years we've made a significant impact on the way organizations approach their software security initiatives. We recently held our annual Tech Fair conference in Dulles VA which provides an opportunity for the entire organization (over 300 strong) to collaborate, present and share ideas on software security. During the conference our CTO Gary McGraw hosted his 100th episode of the Silver Bullet Security Podcast live with our Principal Consultants. If software security interests you be sure to listen in. http://www.cigital.com/silver-bullet/

I'd welcome the opportunity to network with anyone that's interested in exploring Cigital and some our current opportunities. Please email me directly if you'd like to hear more.

Thanks in advance.
