*Hello World!*

I wanted to make a few announcements to the group. First I wanted to let
everyone know I relocated to the east coast, this is why you may see my name
mentioned in the NY/NJ Metro local chapter as one of the board members.
Second, this does not mean I am planning to stop leading the Minneapolis -
St. Paul Chapter. I am planning to do so until the year is up or until any
local member interested in leading the chapter contacts me.  I will be
involved in OWASP and will support our MSP chapter in any possible way I
can. I truly believe we have a great group of security professionals and
supporters and I want to be part of it.  With that said, being in the east
coast will also be good opportunity for our group as I am planning to share
resources and forces with other OWASP chapters in the area.

I also have another great announcement to make. We are currently planning a
mini OWASP conference for the month of October in Minneapolis. Gary McGraw
has expressed his interest and he will possibly be our keynote speaker for
this event. I have a good list of speakers and people interested in
participating in a discussion panel. Rohyt Belani will be offering a
training session during this conference, and we have more great stuff we are
planning for this event. Stay tuned! I will be providing more information
through the upcoming months.

Please remember NYC AppSec 08 conference. This is going to be the largest
OWASP conference ever, great speakers including the OWASP founders and great
tracks! Please see the site for more information.

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_NYC_AppSec_2008_Conference#OWASP_NYC_AppSec_2008_-_September_22th-25th_2008

Also, we are looking for people who want to help us with the ESAPI project.
We need to provide sample code, revise and update documentation, review and
test the ESAPI code.  Dinis Cruz, one of the founder of OWASP is offering us
monetary incentive through the Season of code project. This is a great
opportunity for students and other members interested in contributing to a
KEY OWASP project. OWASP is budgeting about $10,000 to start for these
projects and this includes the ESAPI.  Get  involved!  Check the links below
for more information!

Last thing, I was told that only 4 members of our local chapter have
registered with OWASP and pay their dues. We don't enforce registration or
paying dues but I cannot stress this enough folks. This is a non for profit
organization, we rely on your support to make all these great things happen
please contact us if you or your company would like to sponsor any of these
events.  We need everyone's support! all the contributions go to pay for the
travel costs of the speakers, food and beverages, location of the events and
great initiatives such as the mini OWASP conference we are currently working
on.

Brian Chess (Fortify Software)

Creating secure code requires more than just good intentions. Programmers
need to know how to make their code safe in an almost infinite number of
scenarios and configurations. Static source code analysis gives users the
ability to review their work with a fine tooth comb and uncover the kinds of
errors that lead directly to vulnerabilities. This talk frames the software
security problem and shows how static analysis is part of the solution.

Highlights include:
- The most common security short-cuts and why they lead to security failures
- Why programmers are in the best position to get security right
- Where to look for security problems
- How static analysis helps
- The critical attributes and algorithms that make or break a static
analysis tool

We will look at how static analysis works, how to integrate it into the
software development processes, and how to make the most of it during
security code review.

*Time:* 6:00 pm

*Location:* MnScu Minneapolis Campus (1501 Hennepin Ave), Whitney Center,

 Hi,

OWASP needs your help with a new important project.

We're creating the OWASP Application Security Desk Reference (ASDR) to
capture and organize all the foundational knowledge in application
security.  Like the Physicians' Desk Reference for doctors, this book is a
well-organized reference work that anyone working in application security
will want on their desk.

The OWASP ASDR covers application security principles, threat agents,
attacks, vulnerabilities, controls, technical impacts, and business impacts.
A 900-page alpha draft is available for your review.  We need your help to
get a final version created by August 25, 2008!

Some links:
?        https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_ASDR_Project  ?
Project Page

?        http://www.lulu.com/content/2538516 -- download alpha ASDR draft
?        https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASDR_Table_of_Contents
?        https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_ASDR_Workplan

The OWASP ASDR will be the defining reference work in application security.
Won't you please volunteer and contribute your knowledge to the world?  All
you have to do is visit the Table of
Contents<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASDR_Table_of_Contents>link
above and add your name to a section or topics.

Thank you!

Hi,

Once again, OWASP needs your help with an important project.

As you probably know, the OWASP Testing Guide
V2.0<http://www.lulu.com/content/1375886>was a great success, with
thousand of downloads and a great deal of
companies adopting it as standard for a Web Application Penetration Testing.
Now it is time to begin a new project based on the previous V2.0.



The project's goal is to create a "best practices" penetration-testing
framework, which users can implement in their own organizations and a "low
level" penetration-testing guide that describes how to find certain issues.
