Nice job. Must have taken a lot of hours of editing. Thanks for doing 
this. You have a future in television :)

How did you get the video into your editing tools? What editing tools 
did you use?

Be well

I Dumped/captured the video from my Sony pro-sumer camera, converted the video from the second small MPEG-4 camera, and then opened these files in Final Cut Pro, where I was able to edit and render the video movement/split screens and titles.

Once complete I exported it to high-quality QuickTime movies (about 10gigs/talk), then I ran it though "compressor" a tool that ships with FCP and converted them to ~300meg MPEG-4 800kbps/640x480 streaming files and uploaded them to Viemo.  

Viemo then converts them into Flash Movies, and your browser downloads the file/streams with out need for a streaming media server.

If people have more questions I would be more than willing to share details, however it was a lot of pre and post-production work to edit these together.  

-David

dedicated to maintaining a list of web application related security

tracking only media reported security incidents that can be associated with
a web application security vulnerability. This presentation will highlight
the statistics gathered from the first half of 2009 (January - June) and
provide insight into categories such as: 1) Top Attack Methods, 2) Top
Compromise Outcomes, 3) Top Target Geographic Region, and 4) Top Vertical
Markets Hit. The presenter will also provide some in depth analysis for
emerging threats/attack techniques such as planting of malware on websites
and reflected cross-site scripting through SQL injection.
