Good morning OWASP MSP community.  We have edited and uploaded Micheal Craig's talk from the February chapter meeting to Vimeo for your review.

Topic: Enterprise Application Security Practices: Real-world Tips and Techniques

Michael did an excellent job on explaining how dell has managed to get their arms around the many internally developed software, how to reduce their risks, and tips on what worked for them.  This talk focused more on the high level program management, but was very valuable in the information it brought to the table for everyone.

Please feel free to check out, and to forward the link along, the OWASP MSP Vimeo channel is at http://vimeo.com/channels/owaspmsp.

Thanks!
