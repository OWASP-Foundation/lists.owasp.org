*The Talk:*

*Smart Phones Dumb Apps*

Enterprises are targeting both internal users and customers with smartphone
applications for platforms such as Apple iPhone and Google Android. Many of
these applications are constructed without fully considering the associated
security implications of their deployment.  Breaches can impact both users
as well as the enterprise distributing the application as attackers take
advantage of expanded access to sensitive data and network services. This
talk discusses emerging threats associated with deploying smartphone
applications and provides an overview of the threat modeling process. The
presentation then walks example applications from an attacker's perspective
demonstrating the sort of information they are able to extract allowing for
more advanced attacks.
