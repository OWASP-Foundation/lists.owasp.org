Welcome to OWASP MSP in 2017

Our March Chapter meeting is scheduled for February 15th.

*Location - Best Buy Hq - Use the Visitor parking off Penn and the Visitor
Entrance.*

We welcome Bob Sullivan to talk about Application Security - Full static
analysis on 2 hours a month:

Application Security - Full static analysis on 2 hours a month -

Modern tools enable agile teams to scan all their code for a long list of
common programming blunders. Hardcoded passwords, SQL Injection, Cross Site
Scripting and many common security vulnerabilities can be detected simply
by running a tool. We deployed a static analysis tool and brought 85
applications under control in 6 months. This presentation will provide
checklists for planning, tool selection, roll-out, metrics and governance.
Let's explore getting started.

Bio: Robert Sullivan is responsible for Enterprise Security Architecture at
Surescripts. He leads security assessments, security standards, product and
platform security. Prior to joining Surescripts Robert parlayed his 15
years of programming in C, C++ and java to lead software security teams at
UnitedHealth Group, as well as Target corporation. As such, Robert has
become very familiar with the value and deployment of static code analysis
tools. In addition to being a speaker and security instructor, Robert is a
contributor to OWASP WebGoat and Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP). Robert holds a BS
in Computer Science from The University of Wisconsin/Madison and a Masters
in Software Design. Robert started attending & leading OWASP meetings when
java was young and holds CISM, CISA, CISSP and CHPS certifications."
