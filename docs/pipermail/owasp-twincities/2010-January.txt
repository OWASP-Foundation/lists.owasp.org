Hi,

 

My name is Dean Barta. Fortify Software has opened a office in the
Minneapolis Region to better serve our customers. I would like to
sponsor or host an upcoming OWASP event and introduce ourselves and
could bring a relevant speaker to discuss topics of most interest.

 

Thanks

 

Dean

Hello Dean,

Thank you for contacting us about sponsoring/hosting an upcoming OWASP
event. Please feel free to e-mail me and Lorna Alamri (
lorna.alamri at owasp.org) directly to coordinate potential sponsoring/hosting
opportunities.

One of your firm's finest, Pravir Chandra, presented last summer on
OpenSAMM. Take a look at
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Minneapolis_St_Paul_2009_Conference for
more information.

Speaker proposals are of course welcome. Presentations should stick to the
scheme posted at http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement, which in
a nutshell says to keep presentations non-commercial, open, and ethical.

Thanks again, and we welcome the new Fortify Software field office to the
Twin Cities.

-Adam
