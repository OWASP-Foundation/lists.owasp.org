OWASP MSP meeting.


The Presentation:

Threat Modeling (by example)

How will attackers break your web application? How much security
testing is enough? Do I have to worry about insiders? Threat modeling,
applied with a risk management approach, can answer both of these
questions if done correctly. This talk will present advanced threat
modeling step-wise through examples and exercises using the Java EE
platform and focusing on authentication, authorization, and session
management. Participants will learn, through interactive exercise on
real software architectures, how to use diagramming techniques to
explicitly document threats their applications face, identify how
assets worth protecting manifest themselves within the system, and
enumerate the attack vectors these threats take advantage of.
Participants will then engage in secure design activities, learning
how to use the threat model to specify compensating controls for
specified attack vectors. Finally, we'll discuss how the model can
drive security testing and validate an application resists specified
attack.

The Speaker:

Subject: [Owasp-twincities] 2012 Global Board of Directors - Elections
Message-ID: <4db8de1b.c832e70a.5da8.1e5f@mx.google.com>

The 2012 OWASP Elections of Officers is coming up for OWASP Foundation
Global Board of Directors.

FAQ:

Who can run for election:

Answer: ANY current OWASP Individual Member (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership )

====

Step #2 

Review https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership/2011Election   <---
important


Every member of OWASP Foundation understands that the WIKI is KEY to the
community.. so edit and add yourself to the as a candidate and link to your
BIO and modify to include a  "Why Me Profile" - you do have a wiki account
right?

Between NOW and June, candidates will have had time to flush out who has the
TIME and is SERIOUS for the role.  Some members may drop out of the race and
endorse other candidates.  When we reach the OWASP Global AppSec EU (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSecEU2011 ) we will announce officially
the candidates for the election and then move to a election by membership
administrated by the OWASP Global Membership Committee.

====

So.... in summary NOW is the time to make this a topic at your next chapter
meeting (who will you endorse or nominate your chapter/project leader) and
obtain support from global committees of your accomplishments.

Thanks in advance for your support of a democratic and rough consensus
model.
