<PRE>Mission:
To find and fight the causes of insecure software.
To produce free, unbiased open source documentation, tools and standards.

Presentation:
This month Bob Sullivan presented Security Principles from the OWASP Guide
(Sam Buchanan assisted with commentary)
Hilights from discussion:
- Most of our jobs cover only a part of the scope needed to fully apply
principles like 'Fix security issues correctly'.
Often we're involved in one step of the detection,  analysis,  clean-up,  fix or
periodic audit.
To make significant change we need to educate the architects and product
managers.

- Simplicity, as a principle, battles with least priviledge and defense in
depth.

- Dealing with external systems is daunting. Sometimes these systems are within
our family of companies/colleges.
People at our organizations do not like it when we will not open up our systems
to them since, like we tell them, &quot;we have to assume that your system has been
hacked&quot;.

Projects:
We discussed the possiblilty of presenting two sessions on Web Security at the
local ISSA conference.
The ISSA conference is May 17 &amp; 18.
This would be an excellent way to promote Web Application security.

  Key questions:
  a. What is the audience that would attend the ISSA conference?
  b. What Web Application topics/demonstrations would be most successful?
A meeting with ISSA is scheduled for next week.

Business:
Two suggestions came up around meeting locations.
First, we could reach more folks from St. Paul if we met over there.
Second, we could meet somewhere that you could grab a beer.

Jan 10 at 6:00 pm we will meet at the Golden Valley Library.
Please send your ideas for topics and speakers to this list.
