<PRE>ISSA is planning for three tracks at the spring conference.
One each for people, process and technology.

They have asked us to put together a few survey questions that they could
distribute to their membership to guage interest in web application security.

I have put together a draft survey that describes three potential offerings for
the technology track.
Please offer you comments to refine these descriptions.

I would like to do this on the list with some discussion and completion at the
January meeting.

--------survey begins here---------------------------------------
Please rate your interest on the following three potential presentations:

a. The OWASP Top Ten web application security vulnerabilities. (1 hour)
Learn about the Top Ten Vulnerabilities and how to protect against them.

The OWASP Top Ten provides a minimum standard for web application security. The
OWASP Top Ten represents a
broad consensus about what the most critical web application security flaws are.
Project members include a
variety of security experts from around the world who have shared their
expertise to produce this list.
There are currently versions in English, French, Japanese, and Korean. A Spanish
version is in the works.
We urge all companies to adopt the standard within their organization and start
the process of ensuring
that their web applications do not contain these flaws. Adopting the OWASP Top
Ten is perhaps the most
effective first step towards changing the software development culture within
your organization into one
that produces secure code.

1 - Yes, I will certainly attend
2 - Interested, need more information
3 - Not interested


b. Web Application Security: vulnerabilities, detection tools and
countermeasures.(1 hour)
The recent rash of web application attacks is part of the growing threat to
online commerce and your use of
the internet. Learn about the vulnerabilities, implications and response to a
web attack. View three sample
attacks and learn about business processes and tools to close the web
application security gap.


1 - Yes, I will certainly attend
2 - Interested, need more information
3 - Not interested

c. Web Application Security: detection and testing tools (4 one-hour sessions)
Alternate (hot) name: &quot;Web Application Hacking tools and techniques&quot;
The web application security threat is growing, yet it is costly to acquire and
maintain knowledge on how
to test and protect your web application. This workshop will train you to find
your own weaknesses using a
free set of tools developed by the Open Web Application Security Project
(OWASP).
You will receive instruction to install and use these OWASP tools:
WebGoat   : A J2EE web application designed to teach security lessons.
WebScarab : A framework and web proxy tool used to capture and modify HTTP(s)
converstaions.

Hands-on lessons will be presented on some of the following vulnerabilities:
-Cross Site Scripting
-SQL Injection
-Thread Safety
-Hidden Form Field Manipulation
-Parameter Manipulation
-Weak Session Cookies
-Fail Open Authentication
-Dangers of HTML Comments
-Web services
-Blind SQL
-Weak session identifier


1 - Yes, I will certainly attend
2 - Interested, need more information
3 - Not interested

That's it,
Bob Sullivan
