Good morning!  This week is DC612, Thursday November 12th we will be exploring several topics that include, CTF, USB Multiboot drives, and the Interceptor tool on a Router Station Pro.  This will be a chance for people to create their own bootable USB drives, and have some fun!

CTF

We will have a sign up sheet at the meeting, and create a mailing list for the Red Team/CTF events.  We will also be looking for volunteers to teach a few clasess, such as NMAP, Nessus, Metasplot, etc?

Interceptor

Interceptor is a script and hardware to capture wired traffic and send it unmodified over a wireless connection.  The script was created by DigiNinja and it allows any OpenWRT device to be come a virtually transparent network sniffer.  This means once the device is set, I can watch the wired network traffic from outside the building, over the wireless.  I?ll give a quick intro, and demo on the Router Station Pro hardware and Interceptor tools.

USB Multiboot

Have you ever had a really large USB stick (8 or 16GB) however you can only use backtrack or Bart?s PE as the boot loader wants to take over?  Me too.  We will show you how you can have dozens of operating systems on one USB drive, and boot all of them with ease!  This topic idea came to us from Hak5, and everyone can participate!  So bring your thumb drives (4GB or bigger is best), make sure that you backup or wipe the drive before the meeting just in case, as we will have a computer with a plethora of bootable ISOs and OSes for people to tryout.

Meeting Registration

For this meeting we are going to try out having people preregister- this will allow us bring more equipment if needed... 
To register for this months meeting visit: http://dc612.org/index.php/event-registration/
Please do not feel obligated to put in your address, just use "123" for address, zip, etc.

Fyi, there is a Team OWASP on Kiva (*), it was started by James  
McGovern. There are currently 23 members (including several Twin  
Cities folks), and the team has made over $7,800 worth of microloans.

http://www.kiva.org/community/viewTeam/?team_id=522

-gunnar


* You can go to Kiva's website and lend to someone across the globe  
who needs a loan for their business - like raising goats, selling  
vegetables at market or making bricks. Each loan has a picture of the  
entrepreneur, a description of their business and how they plan to use  
the loan so you know exactly how your money is being spent - and you  
get updates letting you know how the entrepreneur is going.

The best part is, when the entrepreneur pays back their loan you get  
your money back - and Kiva's loans are managed by microfinance  
institutions on the ground who have a lot of experience doing this, so  
you can trust that your money is being handled responsibly
