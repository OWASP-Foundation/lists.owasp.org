March OWASP Meeting -Dan Cornell
Topic Overview: 
Vulnerability Management in an Application Security World

Identifying application-level vulnerabilities via penetration tests and code reviews is only the first step in actually addressing the underlying risk. Managing vulnerabilities for applications is more challenging than dealing with traditional infrastructure-level vulnerabilities because they typically require the coordination of security teams with application development teams and require security managers to secure time from developers during already-cramped development and release schedules. In addition, fixes require changes to custom application code and application-specific business logic rather than the patches and configuration changes that are often sufficient to address infrastructure-level vulnerabilities.
This presentation details many of the pitfalls organizations encounter while trying to manage application-level vulnerabilities as well as outlines strategies security teams can use for communicating with development teams. Similarities and differences between security teams' practice of vulnerability management and development teams' practice of defect management will be addressed in order to facilitate healthy communication between these groups.

Just a reminder that the March OWASP meeting is tonight. Dan Cornell will be speaking on Vulnerability Management. If you plan on attending and have not accepted the meeting invite please do so.  OWASP will not have a snack sponsor for tonight so there will not be any food or beverage supplied at the meeting. There are vending machines in the building, and there is a Subway and a convenience store a couple of blocks down on Hennepin. 
I look forward to seeing you at the meeting, it should be a very good presentation and turn out.

Hello World!

Just wanted to say hi since it has been a while since I emailed to the  
list. I want to remind everyone of today's meeting with Dan Cornell, I  
invited Dan Cornell after I met him at the OWASP EU Summit. I was very  
impressed with the work he has been doing with the OWASP Open Review  
Project (https://owasp.fortify.com/). If you have an open source
code you want to have scanned ask Dan Cornell, he'll hook you up. Dan  
Cornell is also a member of the Global Membership's committee, It is  
really a honor to host him in Minneapolis.

This year we are planning a few great set of events, such as the  
comeback of Bruce Schneier in August, Symantec's Cassio Goldschmidt  
who will join us in June and other possible speakers such as Pravir  
Chandra who is the project leader for the OWASP Software Assurance  
Maturity Model Project (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Software_Assurance_Maturity_Model_Project 
).  With that said, if you have a presentation/topic you would like to  
share with the group please contact Lorna Alamri or me we want members  
to participate. Ge involved!  We are also creating a few chapter  
committees, if you want to be a member of a committee please contact  
us, right now our chapter is in need of people leading the Special  
Events Committee, this committee is responsible for helping us  
organize special events such as mini conferences, special meetings  
such as Bruce Schneier's visit in August and so on.  Another committee  
we need help with is the OWASP Project's Committee, this committee is  
responsible for generating support for OWASP projects, the idea is to  
get people to contribute to projects like the OWASP ESAPI, Code Review  
Project or any other project you feel you can help with.  Adam Baso  
has offered to lead this one however he can use some help! We also  
would like to see a Membership Committee which role is to help us with  
increasing our membership and promoting our chapter locally. If you  
can dedicate 10 hours a month of your time to get involved, contact  
us! Our chapter continues to grow as you have probably noticed,  
however we need to keep growing and find ways to get members to  
participate and contribute back to our community. We also need to work  
on generating funds to operate, we have about $80 dollars available to  
us thanks to those who have paid their dues or have donated to the  
chapter. In this economic climates groups like ours get hit the most  
so now your contributions are more important than ever, you can donate  
to our chapter please go to our main wiki page (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Minneapolis_St_Paul 
) and use the paypal button or contact me or Lorna and we'll make the  
necessary arrangements.

Have a good meeting today! and thanks for your support!!!
