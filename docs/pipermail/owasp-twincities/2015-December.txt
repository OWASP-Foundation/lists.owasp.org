Welcome to OWASP MSP in 2016

Our first Meeting of the year is scheduled for January 13th at the Ewald
Conference Ctr in St Paul.

*REGISTRATION REQUIRED*

We welcome David Lindner to talk about:

Mobile Top Ten Security Risks  - With over 3.1 million applications in the
Apple AppStore and Google Play Store, and more than 7.5 billion mobile
subscribers in the world, mobile application security has been shoved into
the forefront of many organizations.  Mobile application security
encompasses many facets of security. Device security, application security,
and network security all play an important role in the overall security
posture of a mobile application. Part of being a pen tester of mobile
applications is understanding how every security control works and how they
al interact. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has aimed to
help organizations understand the most prevalent mobile risks with their
released OWASP Mobile Top Ten Risk sof 2014.  Join Dave as he walks through
the Top Ten, provides spot the bug code snippets, and explains the typical
vulnerabilities found in doing penetration testing and code review of
mobile applications.
