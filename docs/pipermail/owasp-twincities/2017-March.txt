OWASP MSP Welcomes one of our own for the April Chapter Meeting

Brian Johnson will speak about Containers and Application Security.

Containers are gaining in popularity, but many people are still not
familiar with them and how they work. This can lead to people
misunderstanding them, misusing them or being hesitant to use them in their
environment. This talk will cover containers, their security and how
security practitioners, developers, and testers can leverage them to
improve the security of their applications and systems.

Brian is an Information Security practitioner with a large retailer.  He is
an experienced penetration tester and Security Consultant.
