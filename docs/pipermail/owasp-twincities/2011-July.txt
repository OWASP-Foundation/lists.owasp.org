Message-ID: <CAEizO0CvqqZLoJENpe+Ya5qTjwWbQxvxsgLuKvh8+DsixhKFLQ@mail.gmail.com>

OWASP is piloting a new initiative to promote open source ideals at
our Global AppSec Conferences!

For the first time, we are offering a limited number of free booth
spaces to open source projects as part of the OWASP Open Source
Showcase at OWASP AppSec USA 2011!

We invite ANY open source project - not just OWASP projects - to apply
for a booth at this showcase to demo and promote their project.
Showcase participants need to be ticketed attendees and will be
responsible for manning their booth.

Learn more about this opportunity, including how to submit projects
for consideration, by visiting the following URL:

http://www.appsecusa.org/oss.html


Applications are due Friday, August 19, 2011, and are considered on a
rolling basis - so get moving!

Contact projects at owasp.org if you have any questions.
