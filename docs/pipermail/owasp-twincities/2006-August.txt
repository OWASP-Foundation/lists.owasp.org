Thank you all for the meeting last night. Thanks especially to Pete
Palmer for his presentation on crypto and Apache configuration with
SSL/TLS. I've been out of daily Apache administration for a while; it
was refreshing to feel back in that element, if only briefly. And of
course, thanks again to Lorna for the food.

We left the meeting with an inclination to meet at the same place in
October, but without a clear agenda. I'll throw a few ideas on the
table, including what I remember from suggestions last night.

* Web services security.
* Identity management. No, no more specific than that. It's wide open, people.
* In my talk last night I mentioned the new spate of JavaScript
malware and newly understood dangers of cross-site scripting. I'd be
willing to about that in greater detail. I could even be a less
obviously hopped up on caffeine. :)
* Platform-specific web app security. Java EE, .NET, PHP...
* HTTP Request Smuggling, Response Splitting
* Log management
* Any of the OWASP projects
* SiteGenerator
* Phishing
* Security metrics
* Discuss a chapter of the OWASP Guide.

An updated OWASP Top Ten is scheduled for release at the end of the
year. I suggest that we slate some time to discuss that in February.

So. Thoughts? More ideas? Takers?

I have an identity management SME that could present. Might not be for a few
months. Do you have any specific topics or angle that you would like to see?

Seriously, it's wide open as far as I'm concerned. IDM a big enough
topic that you can take any angle that you want and I'm sure we'll
learn something.  You did mention that you were very busy, so I'm
looking forward to whenever you feel that this is ready to share.
Thanks, Joe.

Attention OWASP Community,

OWASP is moving all of our mailing lists off of SourceForge and onto our
own infrastructure. We?re making this move to allow for better control
over the mail infrastructure and to address some service problems we?ve
been experiencing. Your account will be moved automatically, and you
don?t need to take any action. However, you may want to set your spam
filter to allow messages from the new lists. All OWASP email lists will
come from @lists.owasp.org. All OWASP lists can be found at
http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo

Thank you for your continued support of OWASP.

Dear Robert,

 

IP3, Inc. is a market research and vendor service company, working
exclusively with IT executives responsible for information security,
internal auditing, compliance, business continuity, technology crime
investigations, computer network infrastructure, management, and
standards.  We are planning our 2007 initiatives and wish to offer our 2
Day IT Executive Seminar Series as a part of your association's agenda
for the coming year.

 

We conduct a 20 city "Strategy to Reality" IT Executive Seminar on a
yearly basis.  Attendees are from all segments of business and
government.  Your chapter members have an opportunity to take advantage
of discounted pricing we offer exclusively to the OWASP membership.

 

Our goal is to expand our format and offer greater educational knowledge
to other chapters of OWASP in 2007.

 

Please review the links below for full coverage of our seminar offering
and other services.  If you are interested in planning an event please
respond.  We like to get feedback as soon as possible to finalize our
event schedule.
