Message-ID: <51b606f20704040730t793dcf80tc8e2e7c83d4835fa@mail.gmail.com>

I've had a couple people ask me now about the web app security
training offered by SANS. For example:

http://www.sans.org/training/description.php?tid=455
http://www.sans.org/training/description.php?tid=443

Does anyone here know anything about these courses or have other
experience with SANS courses?

I attended the SANS general security bootcamp. I was underwhelmed. They had
a chapter (approx 2 hours of class time) on web app security. Absolutely
horrible. I have heard good things about some of their more targeted
offerings. I don't know anyone who has attended the web app offering.

One thing I'm interested in is the National Secure Programming Skill
Assessment. I was thinking about doing a quick 5 minute thing on that at our
next meeting.

I believe they have several different classes. A lot of it gets back to who
wrote the class and who is delivering it. I know the one that is based on
Aspect Security's class has very good material.

Criteria Project

This OWASP Project defines an open standard for evaluating XML Security
Gateways. This criteria will provide the OWASP community a set of standard
evaluation criteria to assess the functionality and quality of XML Security

XML Security Gateways to deliver a number of valuable security services.
