Welcome to OWASP MSP

Our May Chapter meeting is scheduled for May 11th.

*Location - Best Buy Hq - Use the Visitor parking off Penn and the Visitor

*Evil Twin Attack with Wifiphisher*

This presentation will revolve around Wifiphisher [1], a security tool
which automates the process of Evil Twin attack in order to mount fast
phishing attacks against Wi-Fi networks. It is an open-source software
that is heavily used by the wireless hacking community and comes with
its community-built templates for different phishing scenarios.

Common defenses for reducing the associated risk will also be discussed,
including Wireless Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems, 802.1X Port
Access Control for robust mutual authentication and security awareness
training.

His research interests include cryptography, Wi-Fi hacking, network
security and web security. He is the lead developer of the popular
open-source wireless hacking tool "Wifiphisher".
