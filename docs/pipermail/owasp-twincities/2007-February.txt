Subject: [Owasp-twincities] OWASP XML Security Gateway Evaluation Criteria
	project
Message-ID: <1172605969.45e48c1189a9b@my.visi.com>

Here is the link to the XML Security Gateway project I mentioned in the last
OWASP meeting

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_XML_Security_Gateway_Evaluation_Criteria_Project

This OWASP Project defines an open standard for evaluating XML Security
Gateways. This criteria will provide the OWASP community a set of standard
evaluation criteria to assess the functionality and quality of XML Security
Gateways. The main driver for this project is to reduce the confusion and
complexity in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of solutions in this the
XML Security space, and enlightening the community as to the utility of XML
Security Gateways to deliver a number of valuable security services.
