in common? They all use Web services for functionality, data access
and integration. Unfortunately, by default Web services also lack a security
model. The OWASP Top Ten Web Services goes into the technical details of the
vulnerabilities, remediations, and examples of common

Web services security issues like authentication and authorization flaws,
how sensitive data is disclosed, and why security standards like WS-Security
and SAML can be your best friend or your worst nightmare.
