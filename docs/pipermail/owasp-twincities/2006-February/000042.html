<PRE>OWASP Twin Cities 2/14/2006

Main Presentation:

Joe Teff gave a insightful tutorial on DREAD.(Thanks Joe)

Joe described three things you should do to make DREAD work:
1. Use the formula Risk =Probability * Impact

2. Impact = D * A
Here D is the damage assessed in terms of Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability. A stands for Affected Users, or the size of the user base.

3. Probability = R + E + D.
Here R (Reproducibility) is the difficulty to reproduce. E (Exploitability)
is the difficulty to execute the attack and D (Discoverability) is the
likelihood that it will be found.

4. Use a small number of well defined values.

Book Discussion:
We discussed security books and decided to read Spies Among Us by Ira
Winkler. Pick up a copy. We'll discuss the first two case studies (Spy vs.
Spy and Nuclear Meltdown) at the April meeting.

WebGoat:
Bob Sullivan demonstrated a few Cross-Site-Scripting and SQL-injection
attacks using WebGoat. WebGoat is a useful tool for showing and teaching
about vulnerabilities.
We discussed building a 'password reset' lesson.

It turns out that WebGoat 4.0 (not released yet) has a password reset
lesson.
However, version 4.0 needs some cool lessons in:
- forced browsing (much easier with WebGoat's new use of JSPs),
- session management
- denial of service
- web services (especially exploits with xml)
- anything else that is not already there

If you have an interest in building a 4.0 lesson please respond to the list,
here, with your suggestion. If you are up to the challenge of helping to
finish and release 4.0 contact Bruce Mahew at:

Next Meeting:
Lorna from Integral Business Solutions (Roseville) suggested that we could
meet there in April. Better yet, Integral would provide food. Watch for a
date and agenda in the next two weeks.

We are looking for presentation ideas and people willing to present. If you
have any suggestions or would like to present yourself please contact Bob
Sullivan and the OWASP Twin Cities mailing list.
