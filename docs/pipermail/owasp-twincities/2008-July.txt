Services

 Topic Overview

SOA and Web services promise wonderful interoperability, but distributed
systems create lots of room for fantastic failures. This session will
explore the gory details of unique vulnerabilities at each layer of the SOA
stack - from the WSDL interfaces to XML processing (XSD, XPath and XQuery),
to the implementation languages liike Java and C#, to new security standards
like WS-Security and SAML.

Gunnar gave this talk with Brian Chess at the 2008 RSA
Conference<https://cm.rsaconference.com/US08/catalog/controller/catalog>
.

Gunnar was also interviewed by Gary McGraw:

"On the 27th episode of The Silver Bullet Security Podcast, Gary McGraw
interviews software security expert Gunnar Peterson, a Managing Principal at
Arctec Group. Gary and Gunnar begin with the age-old question, "What is
security?" They go on to discuss how Web 2.0 and SOA security is
progressing, the big idea behind "federated identity," whether all market
verticals can follow the software security lead of the financial services
industry, and the inherent badness of the color purple."

Subject: [Owasp-twincities] Tony Stieber's Encryption Presentation Streaming
	Video Posted
Message-ID: <746619.33344.qm@web51009.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

The link to the streaming video of Tony Stieber's encryption presentation at the June meeting is on the chapter page at

    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Minneapolis_St_Paul

This video, as well as several others, can also be found on the OWASP videos node at

    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Video#Videos

Here's a direct link to the video:

    http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2189031826020259616&hl=en

A few notes on the video:

    -Sound quality is a little lacking, but passable. I purchased a wireless microphone setup to hopefully remedy this in the future, but it turns out the Aiptek camera needs a little surgery to use a microphone of one's choosing - at least it looks like it's possible from a search on the web for mods. Anyone handy with soldering? I'm not worried about the camera breaking during soldering, so anyone who can lend some free time and soldering talent in the name of better sounding OWASP presentations, please e-mail me.

    -The video is a little warped because it was uploaded at an HD 16:9 ratio, and Google Video plays back at a 4:3 ratio. I'll try to record in 4:3 going forward, but this video and the one from Gunnar Peterson's were recorded in HD 16:9. Any thoughts on free Mac software for doing a conversion from HD 16:9 to 4:3 with letterboxing?

I'm currently uploading the video of the Gunnar Peterson presentation on SOA security from last night, and will post up the link and a message once complete.

forward it to the LifeCycleSecurity speakers.  If you know of people
that are attending Blackhat and would also like to attend
LifeCycleSecurity please feel free to forward this on to them.  We
have more room available at Caesars than we had expected so we want to
get the word out to as many people as possible and have a great
showing.



Talk to you soon,



Dennis

The link to the streaming video of Gunnar Peterson's encryption presentation at the July meeting is on the chapter page at

The Gunnar Peterson streaming video, as well as several others, can also be found on the OWASP videos node at

    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Video#Videos

Here are direct links to the Gunnar Peterson video segments:

    http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7859027646762182620&hl=en - Part 1 of 2 (letterboxed 4:3)
    http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2189031826020259616&hl=en - Part 2 of 2 (distorted, sorry..wasn't able to make iMovie import this video for conversion...worse, I'm not even sure why my camera created two vids in the first place...gremlins)

Anybody able to lend soldering tools and skills? I'd like to attach a standard microphone port to my Aiptek camera so I can plug in my wireless microphone for future presentations. Strangely, the camera didn't come with this. I'm not worried about breaking the camera, so if you're up to the challenge, my camera's up for surgery.

Now that I have iMovie, I'm running Tony Stieber's presentation through the letterboxing and MP4 conversion process. Will post an update to the chapter and videos pages upon upload of the new version of Tony's presentation.

Hope everyone is enjoying the nice weather. Have a good rest of the weekend and a pleasant week.
