Talk Title: Bulding a Threat Modeling Practice in 7 Easy Steps
Integrating security into the Software Development Life Cycle is a proven
way to enhance software security and by building threat models, an
organization can create a threat profile of its application portfolio and
classify threats under various risk categories to prioritize mitigation
efforts.
The prevalence of web hacking incidents coupled with the ever-changing
threat landscape has heightened the importance of establishing a
consistent, repeatable threat modeling process to help enforce application
security policy across the enterprise in an effort to minimize risk
exposure.

 In this 45 minute presentation, Anurag Agarwal will show you how you can
build a repeatable, scalable, threat modeling process in 7 easy steps,
allowing organizations to manage their risk more effectively and
efficiently.
