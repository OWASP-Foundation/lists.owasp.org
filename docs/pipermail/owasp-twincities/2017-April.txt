Subject: [Owasp-twincities] UMSA Secure 360 and OWASP Booth
Message-ID: <CAERhyrKR6hynVA8aPHpG33dUAZKrkwpD+XNdabz4bm7zWCerqw@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Each year OWASP has a booth at the Secure360 conference.
The booth needs to have someone attending to it during the 2 days of
sessions.
I need 3 volunteers to help me out with this.  The volunteers also receive
the equivalent of a full pass to the conference.  We look to take turns and
accommodate  attending sessions.
The volunteer needs to know basics about OWASP and be wiling to speak with
conference attendees about OWASP. We want to represent OWASP's benefits and
our local chapter.
Please contact me directly.

Thank you!

Alex Bauert
OWASP MSP
