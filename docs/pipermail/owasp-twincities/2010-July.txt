So Defcon is just about here! This month we will be at Elsie's in North East Minneapolis. We are going to go over schedules, content, and fun things to do while in Vegas. We also want to setup a time to have a casual meeting during con with either lunch or drinks. 

Hope people can make it, and please bring your questions, comments or ideas for this years Defcon! 

We will start at around 7pm at Elsie's. 

Please RSVP: http://dc612-2010.eventbrite.com so we know how many tables and chairs to have Elsie's setup. 

Thanks,
