*OWASP Top Ten 2007*

This totally re-written edition lists the most serious web application
vulnerabilities, discusses how to protect against them, and provides links
to more information.



The primary aim of the OWASP Top 10 is to educate developers, designers,
architects and organizations about the consequences of the most common web
application security vulnerabilities. The Top 10 provides basic methods to
protect against these vulnerabilities &#8211; a great start to your secure coding
security program.

Sam has been using the OWASP Top 10 as a training and awareness tool in his
organization. Join us to find out how you can put it to use.

*Top Ten Web Services Security Issues*

Gunnar has compiled a list of Web Services security issues. This comes from
his recent, practical experience and feedback from students that have
attended his Web Services Security seminars. This session will give you
practical advice and a clear sense of which issues are the most important.



Gunnar has also just returned from OWASP Helsinki and the OWASP Conference
in Madrid. This is a great chance to find out what is happening in Europe.
