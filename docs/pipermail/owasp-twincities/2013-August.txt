Subject: [Owasp-twincities] Chapter Meeting for August
Message-ID: <CAERhyrKuoTpGjw=2D8RG6huY2ncHt=z-rOfuy3yS=UOkcY4b+w@mail.gmail.com>

All,

We had scheduled a speaker for the August meeting, however he had to
postpone and I don't have a replacement for him.
Apologies but we will not have a meeting this month.
I am working on next month's speaker.

Thanks,

Alex Bauert
