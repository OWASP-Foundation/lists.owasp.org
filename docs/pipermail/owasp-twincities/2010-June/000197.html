Speaker Topic:

With the increasing practice of outsourcing and using 3rd party libraries, it is nearly impossible for an enterprise to identify the pedigree and security of the software running its business critical applications. As a result backdoors and malicious code are increasingly becoming the prevalent attack vector used by hackers.

Whether you manage internal development activities, work with third party developers, or are developing a COTS application for the enterprise, your mandate is clear: safeguard your code and make application security a priority for internal and external development teams.

This session will cover:

Prevalence of backdoors and malicious code in third party attacks
Definitions and classifications of backdoors and their impact on your applications
Methods to identify, track, and remediate these vulnerabilities
Application Risk Management

Application vulnerabilities are steeply on the rise. At $350 billion per year software is the largest manufacturing industry in the world yet there are no uniform standards or insight into security, risk or liability of the final product.  The development environment is becoming increasingly complex &#8211; application origin ranges from internally developed code, outsourced, 3rd party, Open Source, and Commercial Off the Shelf software.  Ensuring these entities are creating secure software is becoming a daunting task.  Lots of emphasis is placed on IT controls, patching, etc, but the new attack vector is your application.  During this presentation the speaker will recap the state of software security today, discuss some initiatives which are requiring application risk management, and provide suggestions on how you can begin managing the application risk at your organization.

Speaker Bio:

Clint Pollock is a Senior Solutions Architect at Veracode. Since 1997, he has also created security solutions for large-scale enterprise environments on behalf of CREDANT Technologies and Netegrity.
