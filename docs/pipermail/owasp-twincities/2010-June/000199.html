*Speaker Topic:*

With the increasing practice of outsourcing and using 3rd party libraries,
it is nearly impossible for an enterprise to identify the pedigree and
security of the software running its business critical applications. As a
result backdoors and malicious code are increasingly becoming the prevalent
attack vector used by hackers.

Whether you manage internal development activities, work with third party
developers, or are developing a COTS application for the enterprise, your
mandate is clear: safeguard your code and make application security a
priority for internal and external development teams.

This session will cover:


   - Prevalence of backdoors and malicious code in third party attacks
   - Definitions and classifications of backdoors and their impact on your
   applications
   - Methods to identify, track, and remediate these vulnerabilities

*Application Risk Management*

Application vulnerabilities are steeply on the rise. At $350 billion per
year software is the largest manufacturing industry in the world yet there
are no uniform standards or insight into security, risk or liability of the
final product.  The development environment is becoming increasingly complex
&#8211; application origin ranges from internally developed code, outsourced, 3rd
party, Open Source, and Commercial Off the Shelf software.  Ensuring these
entities are creating secure software is becoming a daunting task.  Lots of
emphasis is placed on IT controls, patching, etc, but the new attack vector
is your application.  During this presentation the speaker will recap the
state of software security today, discuss some initiatives which are
requiring application risk management, and provide suggestions on how you
can begin managing the application risk at your organization.

This month we are going to be playing with different Linux-based penetration
testing environments, including but not limited to backtrack and samurai. So
bring your laptop(s) and your favorite penetration testing environment. We

talk/demonstration on creating custom packets using libdnet.

The Hack Factory doesn&#8217;t have a bar, so bring your own food &amp; beer.
