<PRE>Hello netizens! This is an update about the OWASP AppSec USA 2011 software
security conference in Minneapolis this September.

**** CALL FOR PAPERS ****

Have something important to say about software security? The OWASP AppSec
USA 2011 Call for Papers is still open. We're looking for hardcore talks in
cloud security, mobile security, new attacks &amp; defenses, and straight up
software development platforms. Get your submission in before time runs out.
And have your developer friends submit a talk!

<A HREF="http://www.appsecusa.org/talks.html">http://www.appsecusa.org/talks.html</A>

The AppSec USA 2011 talks will be delivered September 22-23, 2011 in
Minneapolis, Minnesota. In addition to the talks, we'll have excellent
keynotes like Moxie Marlinspike.


**** CAPTURE THE FLAG PRE-CONFERENCE CHALLENGE #2 ****

Last month *ChrisKarel* won pre-conference challenge #1 for a pass to the
OWASP AppSec USA 2011 talks. Congratulations, ChrisKarel!

 For June, we're back with another chance for you to score a free conference
pass and get a feel for the AppSec USA 2011 CTF challenges coming this
September. Good luck.
