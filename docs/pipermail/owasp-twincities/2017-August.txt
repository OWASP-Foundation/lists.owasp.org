OWASP MSP September Chapter Meeting

Date: September 28th at 6 PM

Location: Best Buy HQ

We welcome Rohit Sethi (COO) from Security Compass

Title: How Billion Dollar Enterprises Manage Application Security at Scale

Abstract:

Security Compass recently completed a comprehensive research study by
surveying companies across multiple industries with the goal of discovering
how large, complex organizations address application security at scale.
The majority of respondents surveyed were multinational organizations who
reported annual earnings greater than $1 billion USD.  Through this new
research study, we have gleamed novel insights on how large organizations
manage application security at scale.  Through this presentation, we will
reveal aggregated insights, industry trends, and best practices that
illuminate how organizations are addressing application security at scale,
so that you may apply and compare these learnings to the state of
application security at your own organization.
