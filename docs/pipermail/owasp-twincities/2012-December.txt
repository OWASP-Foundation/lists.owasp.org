Hey,

I wanted to write a quick thank you note to all of you who made it out to the latest MSP OWASP meeting and joined in the discussion around "Builders vs. Breakers".  Both Matt and I really enjoy giving this presentation because it always sparks interesting conversations and a variety of stories on how different businesses build security into the development process.  In order to improve this talk, I'd appreciate it if you would take a minute and answer 5 quick questions in our survey here:
