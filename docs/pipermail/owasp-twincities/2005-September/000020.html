<PRE>Our first meeting will be next week, at the Golden Valley library from
6 to 8PM on
Tuesday, September 13th - note the date change.  We will need to wrap
up around 7:45, so that we can get the meeting room cleaned up and be
out of the building by 8 when they close.

Agenda is as follows:

  * mechanics - how often should we meet, where, who can we con into
buying us pizza
  * meeting topics  &amp; speakers - it would be nice if we could map out
6 - 12 months of topics, and assign facilitators for each meeting
  * how can we contribute to OWASP as a whole?  what are other
chapters doing along those lines?

See you all next week!  Those of you who can't make it, please share
your ideas on any of the above topics via the mailing list.  I will
post a summary of the meeting to the list sometime late next week.
