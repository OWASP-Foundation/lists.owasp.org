Subject: [Owasp-twincities] DC612 March 11th Meeting @ Hack Factory - 6-9pm.
In-Reply-To: <1062044941.66221267738142863.JavaMail.root@mail.defensepoint.net>
Message-ID: <140828213.66241267738408457.JavaMail.root@mail.defensepoint.net>

This month we are going to invite you, our great community members, to bring in projects or things that your working on and show them off at DC612. This will be a free form night with good food and conversation. If you have something specific that you think would be fun to demo (Automated WEP Cracking, fun lockpicks, metasploit on a stick, etc), please bring it! 

The Hack Factory doesn't have catered food, so I ask that you pre-register, and I'll order from Pizza Luce again. If you want beer, please bring some. We will have soda on hand for sale. Register at http://dc612-2010.eventbrite.com/ . 

Hack Factory is located in the Seward neighborhood. 
3119 East 26th ST 
Minneapolis, MN 55418.

I think that the April meeting might move back to Elsie's, depending on space and availability.
