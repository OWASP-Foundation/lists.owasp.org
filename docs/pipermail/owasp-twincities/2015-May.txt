Put Down the Megaphone: Effective Security Advocacy Without All The
Shouting (Darren Meyer, Senior Security Researcher)

The Information Security community understands the importance of advocacy.
We know we need to change people?s ways of thinking and working if we?re to
make real progress. But the tool we seem to reach for is the megaphone:
when breaches happen or serious bugs get found, we get (understandably)
shouty. The thing is, that hasn?t been so effective, but what else can we
do? Put Down The Megaphone explores this problem and offers a framework for
effective advocacy based on research and backed by hard-won experience.

5:30 PM Room opens for networking and CPE signup

Subject: [Owasp-twincities] Follow up message for members of OWASP MSP
	Chapter
Message-ID: <CAJBL6nh3Y=1EQyRDkw_C5=WToMV6Amkf90qczMckfx4wm8e5Aw@mail.gmail.com>

All chapter members,

As a follow up message to our June chapter meeting notice you may have
recognized that we are no longer using Eventbrite and have switched over to
use Meetup.com. This is to encourage other meetup groups to find our local
OWASP chapter and to join us. There are a lot of developer centric groups
that use Meetup that could benefit from our knowledge and education.

I apologized if this is an uncomfortable switch for anyone. If it is please
provide me feedback I would love to discuss the change.

-Todd
