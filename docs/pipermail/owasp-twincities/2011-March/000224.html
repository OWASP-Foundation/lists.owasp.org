business are secure. We are the market leader in the fast-growing area of
Software Security Assurance (SSA). SSA gives organizations the power to
ensure that their entire software portfolio -- whether develop internally or
acquired through 3rd parties -- is secure and free of vulnerabilities that
can be exploited by cyber attackers to steal valuable data and cause mayhem.

</I>vary depending on your level of experience and skills. Responsibilities
include but are not limited to:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Scanning customer source code, auditing results with development and/or
</I>security teams and offering plans for remediation of vulnerabilities.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Installing and configuring Fortify products onsite for customers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Communicating technical application security concepts to customer staff
</I>including developers, architects, and managers.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Training customer staff on application security and Fortify's products.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Assessing and scoping of customer's application security needs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Contributing to project planning and other project deliverables.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Customizing the implementation of Fortify's production and test
</I>products.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Collaborating with Product Management and Engineering to enhance
</I>products.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Represent Fortify's technical, business, and professional values to
