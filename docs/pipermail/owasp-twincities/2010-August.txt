OWASP MSP meeting.

*The Talk:
*
*1) How OWASP Works and Guided Tour of OWASP Projects* - This presentation
will focus on Dinis's experience in getting things done at OWASP, what
resources are available, and what types of initiatives local chapters should
be doing. In addition to a quick overview of a number of key OWASP projects,
this talk will also provide a tutorial on how the OWASP WIKI (MediaWiki
based) can be used as a database (using the MediaWiki templates technology).

*2) Using the O2 Platform to Consume OWASP Projects* - This presentation
will focus on how to consume the OWASP Wiki and a number of OWASP projects
using the OWASP O2 Platform<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_O2_Platform>.
The O2 Platform has powerful technology and capabilities for both blackbox
and whitebox analysis and this presentation will provide examples on how to
use O2 with WebGoat<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project>,
WebScarab <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project>,
Code Crawler <http://codecrawler.codeplex.com/>,
DirBuster<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_DirBuster_Project>,
Testing Guide<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project>,
Code Review Guide<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Code_Review_Project>,
and OpenSAMM <http://www.opensamm.org/>.

The O2 Platform is focused on automating application security knowledge and
workflows. It is specifically designed for developers and security
consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough source
code-driven application security reviews (blackbox + whitebox). In addition
to the manual findings created/discovered by security consultants, the OWASP
O2 Platform allows the easy consumption of results from multiple OWASP
projects and commercial scanning tools. This allows security consultants to
find, exploit and automate (via Unit Tests) security vulnerabilities usually
dismissed by the community as impossible to find/recreate. More importantly,
it provides security consultants a mechanism to: (a) "talk" with developers
(via UnitTest),  (b) give developers a way to replicate + "check if it's
fixed" the vulnerabilities reported and (c) engage in a two-way conversion
on the best way to fix/remediate those vulnerabilities.
