<PRE>Hi, Everyone -

I spent some time on the phone this morning calling various libraries
to find us a meeting room.  The places I called were either booked for
the 14th, or not interested in answering their phones.  I've reserved
the meeting room at the Golden Valley library from 6 to 8PM on
Tuesday, September 13th - note the date change.  We will need to wrap
up around 7:45, so that we can get the meeting room cleaned up and be
out of the building by 8 when they close.

Hopefully this change to the date won't prevent anyone from attending.

The Golden Valley library is at 830 Winnetka Avenue North.  Heading
west out of downtown Minneapolis on highway 55, you would turn right
at Winnetka.  The library is on the east side of the street, one or
two stoplights to the north.

So far, we have 20 people on the mailing list - hope to see you all
there!  Feel free to bring coworkers, friends, pets that do
interesting tricks, etc.

-daniel
