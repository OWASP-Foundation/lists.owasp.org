Subject: [Owasp-quebeccity] Looking for new leader for OWASP Quebec City
	Chapter
Message-ID: <CAA_HhVJCHRxvHFYGHML_VUvz0O5yFgJSa+OibE7E92qJjZUW4g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear OWASP Quebec City Meeting Attendees and Other Interested Parties -

Within the last week the Quebec City Chapter leader has contacted us to let
us know that he will be very busy with other activities for the foreseeable
future and thus would like to resign from the leadership position. So, we
will be looking for someone to take over leadership of this chapter.

If you are interested in leading or being part of a leadership team for this
chapter, please send me an email.  Also, verify that you have read the
chapter leader handbook as indicated on our chapter page.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Chapter and let me know if
you have any questions.

Depending on how many responses I get, I will either turn over the
leadership to person or group of people interested.  Hopefully if more than
one person responds, they will be willing to work together to get the
chapter back up and running!

Best Regards,
Sarah Baso

Best Regards,
Sarah Baso
