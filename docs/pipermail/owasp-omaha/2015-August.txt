Good Day OWASP Omaha,

I've submitted the Web Services Security Testing Cheat Sheet to the WiKi
for edits/stylization prior to it being published to the Cheat Sheet
Section of the main OWASP site.

A special thank you to the following contributors:

John Rogers
Zac Fowler
Fred Donovan
Rob Temple
Andrew Freeborn
Sai Uday Shankar Korlimarla
Robert Nordstrom
Justin Williams.

The above names will go down as contributors to this document. I'll alert
everyone when the document is actually published to the OWASP WiKi site.

Thank you again, and hopefully I'll get to see some of you at Defcon!
