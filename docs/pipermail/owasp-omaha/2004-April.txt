Subject: [Owasp-omaha] Hello, I'm new...

I've been out of college for a little more than a year and I take my GSSP-J
exam this wednesday.  I waffled alot about taking a more secure-focus for my
programming career because to me 90% of security seemed like boring admin
work... but then I realized through studying for the GSSP-J that the "boring
work" was absolutely essential--and impossible to get away from, even as a
developer.  (Especially with modern frameworks like Spring.)

So,* I'm here to learn* and contribute where I can, and help promote secure
techniques in my company.  I'm also taking a security focus for my Master's
in CS here @ UNO.
