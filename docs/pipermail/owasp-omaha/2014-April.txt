administrators, support, etc.

security communities.
The secondary tracks are:

OWASP-specific

leadership workshops; etc.
Hands-On Skills Lab
Introductory workshops designed to familiarize attendees with critical
tools (e.g., ?nmap 101?).
We invite all practitioners of application security and those who work or
interact with all facets of application security to submit presentations
including, but not limited to the following subject areas:

Secure development: secure coding, static analysis, application threat
modelling, web frameworks security, countermeasures, SDLC, DevOps, etc.
Mobile security: Development and/or testing devices and the mobile web
Cloud security: Offensive and defensive considerations for cloud-based web
applications
Infrastructure security: Database security, VoIP, hardware, identity
management
Penetration testing: Methodologies, tools, exploit development, evasion
