<PRE>Good evening OWASP Omaha!

Thursday's event is shaping up nicely.  UNO's College of IS&amp;T is putting up some dough for lunch, so come a little early before John starts talking at noon. (Pizza at 11:45 is the plan; it's a college!)

Please take a moment to RSVP at <A HREF="https://www.eventbrite.com/event/6952516163,">https://www.eventbrite.com/event/6952516163,</A> so we have a rough idea of participation for the food count.


Parking and Room Location

-          Attached is a **parking pass** for June 6.  Print it out ahead of time and drop it on your front dash.

-          UNO's Peter Kiewit Institute is located at 67th and Pacific. Park in the north lot (Lot 2) using your pass.

-          Room PKI 279 is on the second floor, second door on the right when you come up the stairs.

Can't make it?

-          We're going to run a live Google+ Hangout again.  Look for the URL via this email and twitter (@owaspomaha) around 11:45.

-          This will be a presentation with slides, so it will be easier to follow online than our first meeting.


See you on Thursday!

Copy from the EventBrite event follows.

This talk focuses on the first three candidates of the 2013 OWASP Top 10. John will demonstrate attack examples, common tools to find these flaws, and consequences that occur without remediation or mitigating controls.

Previously John worked as a Lead Security Engineer at ACI Worldwide, Inc. John is one of the unique Application Security Professionals with over 20 years of experience in all aspects of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for the Banking, Payment and Financial Services industries. John is also a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and serves as President of InfraGard Nebraska

Directions and Parking

PKI is located on the southwest corner of S. 67th and Pacific streets, on UNO's Pacific Street Campus.

UNO has provided a temporary parking pass for June 6 OWASP Omaha chapter meeting attendees.  Please email <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-omaha">zfowler at unomaha.edu</A> for a copy of the parking pass. You will need to print it and place it in your vehicle's front dash.

Please park in the Lot 2, which is on the north side of the building.  (It is labeled as a student lot.)

Room

We are meeting in room PKI 279.  Enter PKI from the front door, walk up the stairs (or take the elevator) to the second floor.  PKI 279 is the second door on the right if you were to come up the stairs.

Food

The UNO College of IS&amp;T will host lunch beginning at 11:45, and the presentation will start at 12:00 PM.  Please RSVP so we can have the appropriate counts.
