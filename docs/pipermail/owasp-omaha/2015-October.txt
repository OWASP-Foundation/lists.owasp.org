Good Day OWASP Omaha!

I hope this email finds all of you well. In case you didn't make it out to
AppSec USA 2015 this year, I've uploaded the VM and my python scripts to my
OWASP Google Drive. I've also added an additional script which was
essentially "homework/extra challenge" for the class participants. This
additional script works best if you're using Kali linux as your attack OS.
I've included a README.txt file to overcome some of the VM import issues
you may encounter.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
