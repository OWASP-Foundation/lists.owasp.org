<PRE>Good evening OWASP Omaha!

Mark your calendars! Our next chapter meeting is coming up, slated for June
12, 11:45-1:00pm at UNO's Peter Kiewit Institute.  We'll be hosting a chat
about PCI 3.0 DSS Req 6, and how OWASP plays in this space to meet those
requirements.  Hope to see you then!

Thu June 12, 2014 - *OWASP in Payment Card Security: Secure Coding, OWASP,
and PCI 3.0 DSS Requirement 6*

Data breaches and payment card compromises are more frequent, high-profile,
and damaging. The every day consumer has been hit by large data breaches at
Target, Michaels, and Aaron Brothers, among others. People all around us
can testify to the effects of millions of credit cards in the wrong hands.
It has become commonplace.

The PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) security standards has
recently released a new and improved set of requirements and standards for
any organization that processes, transmits, or stores payment card data.
PCI DSS' infamous Requirement 6 focuses on secure systems and applications,
including secure coding and web application firewalls. OWASP has been noted
in the PCI DSS as a trusted resource for secure coding and application
vulnerability management. Join us for our next OWASP Omaha chapter meeting
as we explore the some of these resources and discuss ways that OWASP can
help meet this requirement.
