iOS. Included in the presentation will be an example iOS Security

*W*a*rm up video: *Michael was *so kind* to provide OWASP Omaha with a warm
up video, which you can view on our YouTube channel here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRnj816ec-8.  Since he will be talking about
how to *use *intercepting proxies for mobile assessments, you might want to
know how to set it up.  This video shows you the basics of setting up a
Kali linux distro with the Burp Suite for mobile testing.
