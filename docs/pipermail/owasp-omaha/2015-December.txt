Subject: [Owasp-omaha] CSP Headers and AppDev
Message-ID: <CAK3pzyubNO+eMubfLJ0Ytvmg_oONGHUvL+VcVa7PWPKqNxto8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning!  In my office we do a lot of web development.

Recently (today) I have started looking into adding CSP headers for our
applications.  Many of them however us Google tools / fonts / analytics.

I've created a CSP string that works, but in order to get google happy I
had to enable unsafe-eval for script-src....

Anyone have experience with this that can offer tips?

Thanks!
