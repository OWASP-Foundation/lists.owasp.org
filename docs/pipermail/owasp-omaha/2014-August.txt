Message-ID: <CAFep6cHeVP_m12f+34yo9x+56+HwzGkozhn1S3f70z5nzG5sVg@mail.gmail.com>

OWASP Omaha,

This presentation was recently shared with me and after a little research,
I found out that it was originally presented at the OWASP 2013 AppSecEU.

Presentation: http://www.agarri.fr/docs/HiP2k13-Burp_Pro_Tips_and_Tricks.pdf
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fRKlf1DsZU

Somewhat verbose, but I did learn some things.
