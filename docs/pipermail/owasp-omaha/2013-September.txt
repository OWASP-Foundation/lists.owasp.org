Subject: [Owasp-omaha] Next Meeting September 12: Understand the OWASP
 Vision and Top Ten, Scott Christiansen
Message-ID: <d92fa60c44614d309d6ff36031540f63@BLUPR07MB082.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Good afternoon everyone!

You may have noticed on the official OWASP  Omaha wiki page https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Omaha that our meeting date has changed.  Scott will be giving our next OWASP talk about the OWASP Vision and  Top Ten on September 12th, 2013.

We are finalizing the location and time, and we will let you all know as soon as we figure it out!

Assuming we can get a good network feed, we'll try to run the presentation over hangouts again for those of you who can't make it.  We'll post the link about 10-15 minutes before the presentation starts.

Subject: [Owasp-omaha] OWASP Presentation Tomorrow: 12pm,
	TriPointe Coffeehouse, Papillion
Message-ID: <59eaef9b64634226a774386b2fedc746@BLUPR07MB082.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Good afternoon!!

Tomorrow's presentation will be a bit more cozy at a coffeehouse setting.  Join us tomorrow from 12pm to 1pm at TriPointe Coffeehouse in Papillion as Scott Christiansen talks about the OWASP Vision and the OWASP 2013 Top Ten list.

TriPointe Coffeehouse
138 N. Washington Street
Papillion, NE 68046
(Just off 84th south of Cornhusker)

Note about food: Lunch is on your own. The coffeehouse doesn't have food on site except for pastries and the like.  We recommend picking something up along the way.  (We will work on food...over the lunch hour... being something more accessible in future meetings.  Dorts Bar & Grill is across the street as an option, as well.)

G+ Hangout: If you can't make it tomorrow, feel free to watch Scott stream his presentation over our Youtube channel.  We'll run an "on air" Google+ Hangout again and send the link out about 11:45 via twitter and email.



Thanks everyone and we'll see you there!

Sorry for the false hope here guys.  Having some audio troubles that we won't be able to work out in time at the venue.

I'll send out slides after the presentation.

Also, Scott can't make it -- surprise CISO meeting -- so John and Zac are covering the presentations.

Look for more from OWASP Omaha soon!
