PARKING CHANGE for 8/24 OWASP Omaha meeting at UNO

I regret to say that we are unable to use the parking pass that was
originally posted to the chapter event posting.  UNO no longer offers this
type of free parking.

**You will need to pay to park on campus tomorrow** At last check, it's
$1/hr up to $4 for the day.

Please park in the new Pacific Street garage, directly to the east of the
Peter Kiewit building.  You can pay using the Park Omaha smartphone app or
in-garage kiosks.

We apologize for this inconvenience and late notice, and I hope $2-$4 won't
keep you away!

See you tomorrow for Joel's presentation about Single Sign On Security!
