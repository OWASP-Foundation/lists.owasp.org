<PRE>OWASP Omaha,

Please see the OWASP Omaha website for a glance at the new 2013 calendar
of presentations.  If you see any major conflicts with any of these
dates, please let me know soon.  We are currently looking for sponsors
for these events.  If you know of a company or organization that might
be interested in sponsoring an OWASP Omaha event, please also let me
know.  Most companies don't know that we exist yet!  Our organization
was highlighted in the recent NebraskaCERT luncheon, and there were
several IT and InfoSec professionals that were very excited to hear
about our new chapter.  So, please pass the word!

I wanted to also invite you to our first Thursday of the month
&quot;informal&quot; chat sessions.   Just to give you a feel for what to expect,
we have a few very cool app sec professionals sitting around a table
enjoying a beverage and chatting about all things appsec related.  We
have had discussions about the greatest app scanners out there
(proprietary and open source), and about Defcon 2012, and many other
interesting topics.  It's totally informal and spontaneous.  Sometimes
its just fun to share what is going on professionally with others that
get what you are doing.  So, feel free to join us on Nov. 1st.  Let's
plan on our normal 4:30 p.m. at Lucky Bucket on Thursday, Nov. 1.

Very Best Regards,

Rob
