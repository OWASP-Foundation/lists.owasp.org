Subject: [Owasp-omaha] Reboot Meeting Today - Bellevue U, 12-1pm

Good morning!

Don't forget about our first meeting at Bellevue University today, 12-1pm.  We'll introduce the Omaha chapter leadership, and talk about the objectives of the chapter.

Can't make it?  We are going to try out G+ Hangouts "On the Air" this afternoon to broadcast a live feed of the meeting.  You can join us in the hangout, or just watch via live-youtube.  We'll send a link closer to the start time.  (We aren't so sure about the bandwidth available to us there, so we will appreciate your patience!)

More details at:
http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5509906278 - RSVP is just for us to have an idea of count; it is not required.
