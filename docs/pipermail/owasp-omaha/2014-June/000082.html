Subject: Application Security Chalk Talk


Greetings!
At Farm Credit Services of America, where I am employed, we go through great lengths to ensure our development teams have plenty of training opportunities to help ensure we can develop the best possible user experience for our customers. These opportunities might come in the form of local or national conferences, self-paced learning &#8211; such as with Pluralsight &#8211; or in-house training &#8211; some of which is taught by employees and others taught by outside experts.
Starting this week, we have the pleasure of bringing in two top-notch security experts from TrueSec to provide application security training to all of our developers - Hasain Alshakarti and Fabio Viggiani. While here, they have graciously agreed to host an Application Security Chalk Talk for anyone interested in attending. This chalk talk is not specific to .NET-based development but applications development in general. If you know of anyone else that might be interested in attending, please forward this along.
We will be hosting the chalk talk this Thursday, June 19th, at Farm Credit Services of America starting at 6:00pm (CDT). If you have an interest in learning more about application security then we&#8217;d love to see you there! Click on the link below for further details and to register.
Hasain Alshakarti
Hasain Alshakarti is an acknowledged security expert and computer industry speaker. He has spoken at TechEd North America, TechEd Europe, and TechDays, as well as other events and conferences across the world.

Hasain has a background as a developer and works closely with developers to help them understand security demands and realize them in applications and systems without losing functionality and usability.
