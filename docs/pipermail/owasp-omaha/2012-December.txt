Subject: [Owasp-omaha] December Informal Meeting - Thursday, Dec. 6
Message-ID: <50BF8791.3090803@owasp.org>

OWASP Omaha,

I wanted to let you know that our informal chapter get together will be
at _*Nebraska Brewing*_ tomorrow,  Thursday, December 6th at 4:30 P.M. 
Please come by and chat if you can. 

Also, I would love to hear from you (in written format or at our
meeting) regarding your strategies for staying focused on your
professional objectives during the busiest time of year!  What a
challenge! 

Some of my own personal-professional initiatives this year have been to
press forward with Python scripting as it relates to web pentesting
tools.  So far, my progress has been marginal at best.  As the busy
lifestyle takes over with family responsibilities, church activities,
etc. consuming more time, my pentesting lab time seems to slip away.  Do
any of you have similar experiences?

Another one of my initiatives is to read more.  I've purchased /iOS
Hacker's Handbook/ (Charlie Miller, et. al) and have read through
Chapter 2, and there it now sits on my coffee table at home collecting
dust.  In addition, I am reading /The Code Book /(Simon Singh), which is
actually a fantastic read, but I'm crawling through it.  I really thing
great reading is paramount, along with practice.  I want to read the
best books in cryptography, appsec, and app architecture.  Where do you
find the time?

Well, I'd like to hear if any of you have the same challenges. 

Regarding 2013 OWASP Omaha events, we have posted them on the wiki;
however, we are still needing a location for our meetings and
presentations.  Let me know if you have any great ideas. 

Thanks and Happy Holidays!!

Rob
