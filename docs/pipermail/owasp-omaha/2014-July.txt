Good Day OWASP Omaha,

I wanted to reach out to everyone and let you know that I will be doing my
best to collect all job openings and postings from you, condense them into
an e-mail, and will try to send them out on a bi-weekly basis.

Here's what I need from you if you know of, or want a job posting included
in the bi-weekly e-mail:

Company:
Job Title:
Required Experience:
Job Link (if applicable):
Resume Deadline (MM-DD-YYYY format):
Brief Job Description:
Contact information listed? (Yes to be listed as someone to contact about
the job, No to not be listed)
Salary range for position (if applicable):
How to apply (email address to send resume, or mailing address):

All submissions must be in my inbox (Michael.Born at owasp.org) by the 12th
and 27th of the month.  I will send the packaged job listings out the 15th
and the end of the month (28th, 29th, 30th, or 31st)

IMPORTANT: Please make sure your Subject line says "Bi-weekly Job Postings"
so I can filter for that subject line.

I and the rest of the leadership team will spend time vetting job postings
to make sure they are as accurate as possible and legitimate.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

Michael
