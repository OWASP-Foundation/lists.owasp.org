<PRE>Good evening OWASP Omaha!

Our next chapter meeting is coming up, and it will be a good one!  We'll go over some of the threats, demo some tools, and talk about how the OWASP lists and resources can help educate you or your teams in the world of web application security.

                Parking: You can park in the visitor lot (circle drive) out front or in the student lot to the north. (Turn right from the circle drive.)

Can't attend? We are going to try to set up the presentation online again if you can't attend.  Keep watching your email or twitter for more as the event gets closer!



Enjoy the holiday weekend, and see you on June 6th!
