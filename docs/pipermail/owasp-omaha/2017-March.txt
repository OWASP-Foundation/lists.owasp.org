Hello OWASP Omaha,

We have a few exciting things to share with you! First, our next chapter
meeting will be March 22, 2017 in PKI 279 at UNO's Peter Kiewit Institute.
Lunch will be provided, so please RSVP so that we have accurate lunch
numbers.

You should receive an email with the Event Brite link:

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-omaha-chapter-meeting-march-lightning-talks-tickets-32704228227

Also, OWASP has a SLACK group! I've created the OWASP Omaha channel for our
chapter to discuss various topics within Application Security and
Development. It's a great place to network with others in this field and
pose questions or tutorials.

https://owasp.slack.com/messages/chapter-omaha/

If you have trouble joining the OWASP slack channel, let me know and I will
invite you directly via slack to your email address.  Once online in the
OWASP slack community, you can navigate to #chapter-omaha/.

We hope to see you at the next meeting.


Thank you,

Michael

Good morning,

I've received a number of questions regarding Slack. I've tried inviting
several of you however it appears you would need to register for the OWASP
Community slack first before being allowed into a channel.

Here is the link to get started: http://owasp.herokuapp.com/

The Channel is #omaha-chapter once you're in.  Hopefully that clears things
up and I'm sorry for the confusion!


Thank you,

Michael

Good morning OWASPers,

 

 

Our March 22, 2017 meeting will occur at 12pm at PKI 279. We have a great turnout so far so thank you for all of those RSVPs. There is a slight change of plans for presentations. I will present on techniques to discover unknown shellcode on x86 Linux instead of John?s READY API presentation.

 

If you still need to RSVP for the meeting you can do so at the following EventBrite url:

We look forward to see everyone there!!

 

Thank you,

 

Michael

Subject: [Owasp-omaha] March 22nd Meeting Update [PARKING]
Message-ID: <7AB6AD3C-57B6-40AA-83AC-AB39EB8ABDFB@owasp.org>

Good afternoon OWASP,

 

It has been brought to our attention that the 72nd street and Pacific entrance will be closed on Wednesday, March 22 due to construction all the way up to the normal entrance into the PKI parking lot. This means we will all have to use the Pine street entrance, or the Aksarben Entrance and turn into the parking lot immediately North of Mammel Hall in order to access the PKI parking lot. You can download the lane closures map from the following location:

Please let us know if you have any questions.

 

 

Thank you,

 

Michael
