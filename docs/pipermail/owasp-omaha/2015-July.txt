Good Afternoon OWASP Omaha,

I wanted to take the time to thank all of you who participated in
recommending suggested edits in the Web Services Testing Cheat Sheet. I've
applied the changes that fit (which was all but one sentence). I have
documented the following people as actually providing comments/suggested
edits that were tracked:

Andrew Freeborn
Justin Williams
Fred Donovan
Sai Uday Shankar Korlimarla

The above people will be marked as "Contributors" in the final Wiki posting
and I really appreciate all of the great edits and suggestions you've
provided.

Thank you all for your help, interest, and continued support for OWASP
Omaha.

Thank you,

Michael
