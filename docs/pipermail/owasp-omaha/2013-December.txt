*Mobile App Security Assessment*
Presented by Michael Born, Solutionary

*When: *December 5, 12-1pm.  Room will open at 11:45 AM for socializing and
pizza
*Where: *Peter Kiewit Institute, UNO's Pacific Street Campus, 1110 S. 67th
Street, Omaha, NE

*Don't forget *about the warm up video! Michael was *so kind* to provide
OWASP Omaha with a warm up video, which you can view on our YouTube channel
here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRnj816ec-8. Since he will be talking
about how to *use *intercepting proxies for mobile assessments, you might
want to know how to set it up.  This video shows you the basics of setting
up a Kali linux distro with the Burp Suite for mobile testing.


See you tomorrow!

Man I hate when that happens. The live stream crashed.  We weren't able to
get it back up.

Very sorry to all who were attending online!

Good afternoon!

The video from Michael Born's presentation is now available online at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca_wpMEHYzE.  Unfortunately the G+ Hangout
died when he switched out of powerpoint, so we're unable to share that part
of the talk.

Thanks to everyone who made it out in person or online, and we'll see you
in March for our next meeting!
