Good Day OWASP Omaha,

No new jobs to report this time around, but there are a couple opening up
in the near future that will probably make the next e-mail. As always, if
you are aware of a job opening, please e-mail me at michael.born at owasp.org
and I will include it in the bi-weekly e-mail.

Thank you,

Michael

Good evening OWASP Omaha!

If you have ideas, comments, or gripes about your local OWASP chapter, now
is the time to provide feedback!


John, Fred, Michael, and I (Zac) are meeting this week to talk about plans
for 2015.  Some things on our agenda include:
- Frequency of chapter meetings (We are considering more often than
quarterly)
- Topics / Presentations (technical vs. policy vs. training vs. nerding out
on topics like bee-keeping or brewing beer)
- Adding a fifth to the leadership crew (Backups are great for computers
and people)
- Getting OWASP Project participation (Contributions!)
- Omaha's role in/for SWAMP (more to come about this)

Ideas for speakers? Things you'd like to learn or hear about?  Want to just
get together for beer?  Maybe just need CPEs? Send an email to me, or the
owasp-omaha at lists.owasp.org mailing list to get the discussion going.

Seriously.  Send some replies, throw a tweet @owaspomaha, email us/me, or
shoot come stop by my office if you're in the area :)

What did we do this year? Review the 2014 events at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Omaha.

Thanks for a great year everyone, and here's to a HUGE 2015 for OWASP Omaha!




Zac and Team
