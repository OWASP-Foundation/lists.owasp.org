Subject: [Owasp-omaha] Web Services Security Testing Cheat Sheet volunteers
Message-ID: <CAGiPKGMz3-NynV=1-8S0-L=CbERO0fFfQNLuFHevZYTG=vvf5A@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning OWASP Omaha,

I have the following names down as volunteers for helping with version 2 of
the Web Services Security Testing Cheat Sheet:


   1.

   Palanivel Jeyaraj
   2.

   Joel Gunderson
   3.

   Andrew Freeborn
   4. Justin Williams


Please let me know by May 8, 2017 if you'd like to volunteer. Also, for
those that have volunteered, please let me know if you have developed any
web services with intentional vulnerabilities. I am happy to spin up a VM
in the cloud to use for this cheat sheet. Version 2 of the cheat sheet
should have concrete examples for as many of the vulnerabilities as
possible.

Thank you,

Michael
