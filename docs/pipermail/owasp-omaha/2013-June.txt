Subject: [Owasp-omaha] OWASP Omaha - So many tools,
	so little time - John Rogers - Thursday
Message-ID: <A4F9E90C14E2D043B508538F2A6E34AD5E6FC2F0@CH1PRD0710MB381.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Good evening OWASP Omaha!

Thursday's event is shaping up nicely.  UNO's College of IS&T is putting up some dough for lunch, so come a little early before John starts talking at noon. (Pizza at 11:45 is the plan; it's a college!)

Please take a moment to RSVP at https://www.eventbrite.com/event/6952516163, so we have a rough idea of participation for the food count.


Parking and Room Location

-          Attached is a **parking pass** for June 6.  Print it out ahead of time and drop it on your front dash.

-          UNO's Peter Kiewit Institute is located at 67th and Pacific. Park in the north lot (Lot 2) using your pass.

-          Room PKI 279 is on the second floor, second door on the right when you come up the stairs.

Can't make it?

-          We're going to run a live Google+ Hangout again.  Look for the URL via this email and twitter (@owaspomaha) around 11:45.

-          This will be a presentation with slides, so it will be easier to follow online than our first meeting.


See you on Thursday!

Good afternoon everyone.

Please disregard this message - we are having troubles with the list manager.  This is simply a test to see if mail is going through.

Thank you!

Hello,

Our OWASP Omaha chapter has worked with the Omaha Chamber of Commerce to put together a bid to get the second largest  hacking conference in the USA (if you lump BlackHat and Defcon together) to Omaha in 2014.  The event is called APPSEC USA 2014.  To show you support for OWASP please go out here http://goo.gl/6HTqB and vote to show your interest and support!    This is a 2500 - 5000 person conference all dedicated to secure coding and web application hacking.  Please tell your friends and have them vote too!
