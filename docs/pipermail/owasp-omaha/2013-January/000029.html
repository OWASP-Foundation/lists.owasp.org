<PRE>OWASP Omaha Members,

I wanted to forward the following announcement from the Colorado OWASP
chapters:

Thanks,

Rob Temple, OWASP Omaha Chapter

==================

The Colorado OWASP &lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org">https://www.owasp.org</A>&gt; chapters are pleased to
announce that the 5th annual Front Range OWASP Conference (SnowFROC
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.snowfroc.com">http://www.snowfroc.com</A>&gt;) will occur on Thursday, March 28, 2013 in
Denver, Colorado, USA.

Effective immediately, the SnowFROC planning committee is accepting
proposals for presentations on topics surrounding cyber security and web
application development and operations.


*_Criteria and Submission_*
Potential speakers may submit abstracts of proposed presentations
to <A HREF="https://dev.aerstone.com/snowfroc/cfp.">https://dev.aerstone.com/snowfroc/cfp.</A>

The submission tool will format newly-created abstracts automatically,
but all uploaded materials must adhere to the following requirements:

  * Only Microsoft Word documents, PDFs, rich-text format documents, and
    text files will be accepted.
  * Author names, affiliations, email addresses, and other
    personally-identifiable information must be stripped from uploaded
    documents.
  * Presentations must contain a title at the top of the document.
  * Presentation overviews should not exceed 300 words.

Presenters will be allotted 45-minute time slots. One abstract must be
submitted for each presentation considered. All abstracts must be
written in English.


*_Evaluation_*
The following criteria will determine abstract rankings:

  * Applicability to the requested topics (see below)
  * Relevance to web application development and operations
  * Relevance to the cybersecurity Industry at large
  * Relevance to the OWASP foundation
  * Strength of presentation (as determined by the review committee)
  * Timeliness of submission

Submitted abstracts will be assessed by selected members of the Colorado
OWASP chapters. All reviews will be blind and reviewers will not have
visibility to author information.


*_Dates and Deadlines_*
Abstract collection begins immediately and will continue until all
speaking slots are filled. Rolling evaluations will occur with selected
papers announced each Monday beginning on February 11th. Although the
rolling format extends the submission period significantly, potential
speakers are advised to submit as early as possible in order to maximize
chances for selection.

Final presentations of accepted abstracts must be submitted for review
by March 17th. Templates and other presentation formatting constraints
will be made available to selected speakers directly.

All accepted presentations will be delivered during conference
proceedings on March 28th, 2013.


*_Legalities_*
All speakers must agree with and abide by the OWASP Speaker Agreement
v2.0 &lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement</A>&gt;.

*Anyone who cannot or will not abide by these terms will not be
permitted to present at the conference.*

In addition, presenters must agree to allow use of abstract titles,
text, and speaker names and bios for conference promotion. With speaker
consent, presentation materials will be distributed to conference
attendees and will be archived for future reference. With speaker
consent, presentations will be recorded and archived.


*_Preferred Topics_*
SnowFROC 2013 is a multi-track conference emphasizing a breadth of
information and skills. Conference organizers are actively seeking
presentations aligning with the following tracks and topics:

*High-level technical track*

  * Web application security testing, especially targeting large and
    complex enterprise applications

  * Secure coding for web applications
  * Static code analysis
  * Hands-on countermeasures
  * Encryption across an n-tiered web application stack
