Discussion and job posts encouraged.  You may have to ensure your email is
a mailing list member before sending.  If you have trouble please email me
at zac.fowler at owasp.org and I'll ensure it get fixed asap.


If you're interested in being part of chapter leadership send John or a
note.  We're looking for fresh ideas, new presos, or anything else.  Time
commitment each month is about 1-3 hrs.  (I said 1:30 in the meeting I know
but 1-3 is more realistic.)  We ask leaders to make a presentation sometime
during the year at a chapter event or at some another event as an OWASP
member.

Nebraska's OCIO Cyber Security Conference is Sept 29, and OWASP's AppSec
USA 2016 is coming up Oct 11-14 in Wash. DC.  Check out the event link
above for the flyer that has a few more events between now and end of year.

Have a great week!

Zac
