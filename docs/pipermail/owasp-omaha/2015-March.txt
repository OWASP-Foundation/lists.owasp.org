Hello Omaha OWASPers,

I just wanted to let you know we will skip the normal first quarter meeting and reconvene the second quarter. Your OWASP Omaha Leadership has been working hard to bring some fresh ideas and activities to the chapter and we are continuing to do so. Therefore, we will not have our meeting this quarter and will meet again 2nd quarter of 2015 with the hard date to be determined. 

As always if you, the participating chapter members, have any ideas or desires for presentation topics, want to present to the chapter, or have ideas for projects we can work on as a chapter please email us and let us know. We look forward to seeing everyone during our 2nd quarter meeting. 

Thank you,

Michael
