Michael,

Thanks for the reminder.

The Automating ZAP slides are now uploaded and I included some additional
Jenkins configuration information in an associated .zip file.

Please let me know if there are any access issues or questions about how to
automate ZAP with either Python or Jenkins.

Happy Holidays Everyone
