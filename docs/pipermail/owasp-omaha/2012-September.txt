Subject: [Owasp-omaha] OWASP Omaha Chapter Restart
Message-ID: <5059E160.2000804@owasp.org>

The OWASP Omaha chapter is now active!  You are receiving this notice
since you were at one point on the OWASP Omaha mailing list.  The
chapter has been dormant for a few years, and a few application security
professionals in the Omaha area are reforming the group.  As you know,
our purpose is to provide the local community with a platform for
software security awareness, education, and development guidance.  We
want to establish a community of both security minded professionals and
software developers with the goal of freely exchanging ideas to create
more secure software.  Software developers (of all languages),
Penetration testers, Information Security Engineers/Analysts, and
students interested in application security are encouraged to attend. 

If you would like more information on upcoming chapter meetings
(informal and formal), please visit the Owasp Omaha wiki.

Thanks,

Best Regards,

Rob Temple
