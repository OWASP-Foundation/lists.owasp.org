OWASP Omaha, good evening!

By now you probably are ware that October is National Cyber Security
Awareness Month <http://www.staysafeonline.org/ncsam/>.  During this month,
we thought it would be a good time to bring a bit more about OWASP to your
radar, so buckle up!

*OWASP Projects*
Did you know OWASP has over 150 projects supported by its members and
community? That's a lot.  Here are some highlights from the "flagship"
category.  Check out their websites if you want to get involved!

*Support OWASP Omaha*
There are a few ways to support the OWASP Omaha chapter, in addition to
attending meetings of course.

*- AppSec USA 2013 - http://appsecusa.org/2013/*
November 18-21, NYC
Support your OWASP Omaha chapter by using "discount code" Support_OMA.
 It's not a discount, but it sends $50 to the local chapter.  If you also *sign
up for OWASP membership* during registration, it sends an extra $20 to our
account.  Oct 15 is the first price break deadline, so register today
before the price jumps by $200.

*- Chapter Meetings and Activities*
Do you work for a company that wants to help sponsor more frequent OWASP
Omaha meetings?  Send me an email!  We do have some limited chapter funds
right now to support meetings (food, swag), bring in speakers, and
generally fund our activities.  We'd love to up the ante!

*- Your membership*
When you sign up for an OWASP membership ($50 for the year), $20 of that
goes back to the local chapter.  Your membership gives you discounts to
conferences like AppSec USA, an owasp.org email, recognition on the OWASP
site, and a vote during elections. Check out the flyer:

Become an OWASP member here: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership

*OWASP Omaha Meeting Feedback*
We want to know what you want to know!  As your chapter leaders, we could
pick each topic with hopes that you will like what we want to talk about,
of course.  We'd much rather hear from you about what you'd like to see
from us!

Please take a few minutes to fill out this survey and send us some
feedback.
