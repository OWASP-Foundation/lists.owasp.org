Zac,  
    A friend of mine, Mandy Chwee, might attend.  Mandy knows 5 languages, has tons of math
and is an MBA student in data analytics.  Mandy is smart, hardworking and is from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
    So, if you see a tall, beautiful, international lady, please welcome her to the group, introduce
Mandy to people if you can.  Mandy works for Ameritas, the biggest insurance company in Lincoln, Nebr.
    And, Mandy is real sharp. Mandy might be a future presenter at user groups or  other events.
    Thanks.
    Bob

Mandy,  Zac Fowler is a friend of mine. Zac and I met at the code camp that you are going to on March 29.
Zac is super knowledgeable on security issues.  Zac makes the Omaha security group meeting available
real time, online, over the web, so we can attend from our desks at work.
    And Zac will be presenting at a security conference in Lincoln, I think this coming June.
Mandy, encourage your work and academic and international colleagues to attend this meeting.
    Bob

Dr Riedesel,

    This Omaha  OWASP group is becoming very active and deals with software security issues.  Omaha OWASP holds  their meetings over the internet so people can attend from their
desk over the noon-hour.
Bob
     


Zac Fowler,
    Dr Charles Riedesel  is a senior Computer Science Professor who knows everybody.
Dr Riedesel would be perfect to help get the word about the real time, on line security meetings
held at your UNO facility.

Bob

Hi, all.

I'm a new member of this list. Nairobi's first cryptoparty, an event to
inform and educate the general public about personal digital security,
will be held at the iHub on 15th April from 4pm to 8pm. Anyone who's
interested in meeting other infosec geeks (such as myself) can show up,
have a good time, and teach someone the ways they can protect themselves
online. Have a great one! :)

Best, Brian.

Judging Criteria

All content assessments will be performed blind. Content reviewers will
have no knowledge of the presenter's identity. All uploaded materials must
be sanitized of author names and affiliations, email addresses, and other
personally-identifiable information.

*Strength of presentation*

?         Vendor neutrality

?         Topicality *(fresh research, innovative solutions, relevance to
current events, etc.)*

?         Depth of content *(deeply technical talks are preferred to
high-level talks)*

?         Relevance to conference tracks

?         Relevance to industry trends

?         Relevance to OWASP or OWASP projects

?         Presentation length *(45-50 minute talks are preferred)*

A second evaluation will occur based on speaker experience. The final
presentation score will be a composite of the two evaluations. The
following criteria will be used during evaluation.

*Strength of speaker*

?         Clarity of submission

?         Demonstrated speaking ability (previous experience, videos of
prior speaking engagements, etc.)
