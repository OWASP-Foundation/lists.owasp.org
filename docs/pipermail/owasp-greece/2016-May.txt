Dear Hackers and Security Gurus,

hardwear.io is seeking innovative research on hardware security. If you
have done interesting research on attacks or mitigation on any
Hardware and want to showcase it to the security community, just
submit your research paper. Please find all the relevant details for
the submission below.

About hardwear.io
----------------------------
hardwear.io Security Conference is a platform for hardware and
security community where researchers showcase and discuss their
innovative research on attacking and defending hardware.
The objective of the conference revolves around four key concerns in
hardware, firmware and related protocols i.e. backdoors, exploits,
trust and attacks (BETA).

Dates
????-
Training:   20th - 21st Sept 2016
Conference: 22nd - 23rd Sept 2016

General Queries: antriksh at hardwear.io
CFP Queries:      cfp at hardwear.io


Topics
-----------
hardwear.io accepts papers on any topic that discusses in-depth hardware
and firmware security both from the offensive as well as defensive
perspective. Some of the topics of interest include (but not limited
to):

- Integrated Circuits
- Processors
- Internet of Things/Smart Devices
- Hardware crypto
- Embedded Systems
- Automobile, Aeroplane, train automation systems and hardware components
- Industrial Control Systems/SCADA Systems
- Satellite Systems
- Medical Devices
- Smartphone firmware, hardware
- Firmware

- Trusted Platform Module
- Radio communication Protocols and hardware
- Hardware trust and assurance algorithms
- Multimedia hardware, firmware, protocols
- Telecom Hardware/Networks
- Electronic/Physical Locks

Categories
---------------------------
1. New Research (40 mins ? 1 hr) ? is a deep knowledge technical track
that includes new research, vulnerabilities, zero days or exploits.
And by new we really mean new i.e. if your research or talk has been
published/showcased (partially or wholly) before, it will fall under
current research category even though there are enhancements/changes
to the original
research.

2. Current Research (40 mins ? 1 hr) ? comprises of known security
issues, new research presented/published elsewhere, case studies,
twist to an existing research, vulnerability, exploit or
research-in-progress.

3. Tool (30 mins ? 1 hr) ? Comprises of open source security tools,
exploits, hardware etc. This is an excellent opportunity for the
original authors to showcase their work to the world.

Submission Format
------------------------------
Email the paper to: cfp at hardwear.io
The subject should be: CFP EU 2016 <Paper Title>
Email Body:
Name
Handle
Talk Category (Mentioned above i.e. research/technical/tool)
Time required (including 5-10 mins of QA)
Paper Title
Country (and City) of residence
Organization and Designation
Contact Number
Have you presented or submitted this paper at any other conference(s),
magazine(s) or portals?
Yes, No.
If yes, where? and how this submission is different from the previous
ones. Note that new research talks already given elsewhere or are due
to be given elsewhere prior to hardwear.io will be considered as current
research category talks unless they consist of cutting edge and ground
breaking technology, which is at the judgement of the review committee.

Are you releasing an open source hardware(or specification)?
Yes/No.
(If yes, please include the design for review)

Are you releasing an exploit?
Yes/No.
(If yes, please include the source and vulnerability details for review)

Are you releasing a new vulnerability/Zero-day?
Yes/No.
(If yes, please send us the details, including reproduction procedure,
for review)

Why do you think your paper is different/innovative and how does it
qualify as new work/research(for new Research category only)?

Are there any live demonstrations (These earn you good points during review)?
Yes/No.
(If Yes, how many? Also please explain each demo)

Brief Profile ( less than or equal to 500 Words)

Paper Abstract ? Please provide detailed working or your
research/work. The more details you provide the better it is for the
reviewers. Please keep the abstract to the point. Please do not try to
hide the technical details or say ?I can?t disclose it till bla bla?
as it does not help the reviewers in any way and may give your paper a
low score because of insufficient information available in the
abstract. Please make sure to add as much technical details as
possible as short abstracts also tend to get low score due to
insufficient information.

Note
-------------------------
Only the original authors should submit their research and any
submission from a third party will be rejected. The Abstract should
clearly mention the techniques and hacks in detail and merely
mentioning that it works will not help in understanding the research
to its full extent. Product/company marketing and pitches will be
rejected. We request you not to submit any product specific talk.
