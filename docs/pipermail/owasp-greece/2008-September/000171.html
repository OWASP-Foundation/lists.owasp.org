&gt;<i> A major warning about the physics experiment's security, as hackers
</I>&gt;<i> bring its website down.
</I>
&gt;<i> The Large Hadron Collider at Cern has been hit by hackers, raising big
</I>&gt;<i> concerns about the IT used on the project, according to reports.
</I>&gt;<i> The Telegraph has reported that a group called the 'Greek Security
</I>&gt;<i> Team' hacked into the facility and posted a warning about weaknesses
</I>&gt;<i> in the project's massive IT infrastructure.
</I>&gt;<i> It said that the hackers left a message on the collider's network
</I>&gt;<i> which described the technicians working on the project as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;schoolkids&quot;, giving a warning that they were not to be messed with.
</I>&gt;<i> The website www.cmsmon.cern.ch cannot be accessed by the public due to
</I>&gt;<i> the attack, but the hackers did say they had no intention of
</I>&gt;<i> disrupting the work of the experiment.
</I>&gt;<i> According to the report, Cern scientists were extremely worried about
</I>&gt;<i> the attack because the hackers were a &quot;step away&quot; from the computer
</I>&gt;<i> control system of one the machine's magnetic detectors.
</I>&gt;<i> It also said that if they hacked into a second part of the network,
</I>&gt;<i> parts of the machine could have been switched off.
</I>&gt;<i> James Gillies, spokesman for Cern, told the Telegraph: &quot;There seems to
</I>&gt;<i> be no harm done. It was quickly detected.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We have several levels of network, a general access network and a
</I>&gt;<i> much tighter network for sensitive things that operate the LHC.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> He also said that the LHC website was very visible, with 98 per cent
</I>&gt;<i> of emails sent being spam.
</I>&gt;<i> The experiment has already gone live, with particle collisions
</I>&gt;<i> expected in October.
