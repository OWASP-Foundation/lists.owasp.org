<PRE>Hello all,

I was asked to assess a jnlp application a while back. Searching the
web provided little to no information as to how one should &#8211; at least
start &#8211; such an engagement, so - I was at it - I set off to create one
myself.

As a you&#8217; ve been warned sign, it is neither groundbreaking research
nor rocket science; and was not meant as such. I gathered some
available information as to the exact nature and semantics of jnlp
application, documented the process and tools I used and provided a
few attack scenarios in a sample application developed for this intent
in a few blog posts that may serve as a starting point to someone on a
similar point in the future.

The starting post is at
<A HREF="http://zqyves.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/jnlp-application-security-assessment-setting-the-scene/">http://zqyves.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/jnlp-application-security-assessment-setting-the-scene/</A>

The rough structure of the posts is the following:
&#8226; &#160; &#160; &#160; JNLP Application Security Assessment &#8211; Part 1 : Analysis of a
typical JNLP file
&#8226; &#160; &#160; &#160; JNLP Application Security Assessment &#8211; Part 2 : Runtime
Mapping of a JNLP Application
&#8226; &#160; &#160; &#160; JNLP Application Security Assessment &#8211; Part 3 : Application
decomposition / Static analysis
&#8226; &#160; &#160; &#160; JNLP Application Security Assessment &#8211; Part 4 : Dynamic analysis

Best regards,
./Zacharias
