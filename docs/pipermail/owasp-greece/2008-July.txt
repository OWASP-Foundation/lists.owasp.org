"Internet-connected systems are subject to millions of online attacks 
every day. Internet users on the other hand are plagued by malware, 
spam, phishing, and other malicious activities. Besides the constantly 
increasing number of security incidents, we are witnessing a steady rise 
in attack sophistication. During the last few years, there has been a 
decline in the number of massive easy-to-spot global epidemics,
and a shift towards more targeted and evasive attacks. At the same time, 
cyber-criminals, motivated by significant financial gains, constantly 
devise new deception and exploitation methods. Raising awareness and 
understanding the issues involved is of paramount importance."
