SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2016

>From the makers of *SANS NetWars, *CyberCity*, *One-Hour CtF*,* *SANS Pen
Test courses*, labs, and much more... comes the 2016 SANS Holiday Hack
Challenge
<https://click.email.sans.org/?qs=131e070ccff4ea5ba3f8e260f159233a48ff3e7643b76cd3b2fd1f0d15f0bc3eb9fab9f2112cce9c>.
This is our annual gift to the information security community. Do you hack,
want to hack, want to know what hacking is like, and want to do it with
whimsical Holiday Cheer and excitement? No... oh, ok... then carry-on. Oh!
You do? That's GREAT!

*Ed Skoudis, Josh Wright*, and their merry team of hacking elves have
poured in hundreds of hours of talent, creativity, education, fun, and the
catchiest of Holiday tunes into the most fun you'll have hacking during the
rest of 2016 and in to 2017!

Why do we do this? It really is a labour of love for Ed, Josh, their team,
and the Pen Test Curriculum at SANS. The SANS Promise is that what you
learn from us today, you can apply directly to your job the very next the
day, and that is what the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge is all about!

Join thousands of your fellow information security professionals in a
virtualised world where you'll need to find out "Who did it" and you can
only begin by going here: www.holidayhackchallenge.com
