Hi everyone,

We're in the process of moving all our mailing lists away from
SourceForge to a mail server we control.  We've had several problems
with reliability and maintainability with the SourceForge lists, and
this will allow us to administer them more easily.

I apologize for the extra messages you've probably been receiving.
We'll get this straightened out as quickly as possible.  Thanks for
your patience.
