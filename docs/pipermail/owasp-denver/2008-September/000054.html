<PRE>Folks,

We had light attendance of the Sept meeting so I expect that many folks
will be interested in checking out the .ppt:

Also, please mark your calendars for the Oct meeting:

Centralized Security Functionality In a .NET World &#8211; The OWASP .NET
ESAPI Project

The Enterprise Security Application Programming Interface, or ESAPI, is
a one-stop security shop for developers looking to implement security
mechanisms in their code. The brainchild of Jeff Williams, one of the
founders of OWASP, the ESAPI is an open source project that has gained
traction with organizations looking to implement secure applications
using tried and tested code that is also well organized and consistent.
It includes functionality for validating and encoding data,
authenticating and authorizing users, logging, error handling, and more.
The API includes a Java reference implementation that can be extended to
allow any organization to integrate security functionality into their
Java/JEE applications.

But what about .NET? Many organizations are banking on the powerful
Microsoft programming framework to help them deliver robust and secure
software. However, like Java, .NET tends to leave it up to the end-user
programmers to get security code right. The OWASP .NET ESAPI project
intends to help .NET developers avoid introducing security
vulnerabilities into their code by providing a full port of the original
ESAPI project from Java to C#.

This talk will explore the gains, gripes, and gotchas of converting the
ESAPI to .NET from the .NET ESAPI project lead himself. It will discuss
features of the .NET frameworks security model, key differences between
the Java and .NET platforms, and ASP.NET web security issues.
Additionally, future ideas for .NET specific functionality will be
proposed and discussed. Participation and feedback from the attendees is
expected and encouraged.
Speaker: Alex Smolen of Foundstone

Cheers,


DC
