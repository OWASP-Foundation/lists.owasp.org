   Please come join us for our March OWASP Denver Meeting. Enjoy some great
   food, drinks and networking courtesy of South Seas, a division of Solutions
   II.

   Matt Shufeldt (IS Director for Sports Authority/Information Security and
   Risk Consultant) will be presenting on a topic we all love (when advocating
   for budget) and all hate (when that time arrives), data breaches.

   Data Breaches: Strive to Prevent, Be Quick to React and Know your Roles
   and Obligations. It is every Information Security professional and senior
   executive's nightmare. Two dreaded words, Data Breach. Now more than ever
   it is important to know the different types and size of breaches. It is
   also imperative to understand how to be a hard target for those actors
   targeting you. Finally, we will discuss the different factors you should
   consider when you think you might have been compromised or you know you
   have been compromised.
