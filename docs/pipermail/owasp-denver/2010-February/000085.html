<PRE>Hi All,

I have attached 2010 RMISC copy of &quot;Call for Papers&quot;.

Here is a brief summary of 2010 RMISC program that you can populate as part of your email communication. Please call my cell if you have any questions.

2010 Rocky Mountain Information Security Conference
Wednesday, May 05, 2010
7:00 a.m. - 5:30 p.m.
Marriott Denver Tech Center
4900 South Syracuse Street, Denver, Colorado 80237

We are pleased to announce the fourth annual Rocky Mountain Information Security Conference (RMISC).  ISSA and ISACA Denver Chapters have partnered together again to deliver a comprehensive conference addressing information security, IT auditing, compliance and governance. The conference promises a day of education through discussions with industry-leading and local information security, audit, compliance and
IT professionals, as well as thought-provoking breakout sessions on Auditing, Managerial, Technical and Cloud Computing.

Our goal is to provide you with a one-day, low-cost, &quot;no travel required&quot; hiatus from those pressures so you can learn about the latest security trends; interact with industry thought leaders and leading security and auditing vendors; and network with peers to share project successes and war stories.
=========================================================================================================================================================

Thanks,

Ram Ramadoss
Vice President - Education
ISACA Denver Chapter
