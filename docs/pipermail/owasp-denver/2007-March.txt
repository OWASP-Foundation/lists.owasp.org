Next Meeting
Topics
The next meeting of the Denver OWASP chapter will be on Thursday, April
19. There will be two presentations. Kartik Trivedi, Director of
Application Assessment at Accuvant and also the Southern California
OWASP leader will be presenting on an interesting technical topic that
has yet to be finalized. 

On the less technical side, Doug Staubach from EchoStar will be
presenting on the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI
DSS). PCI applies to all companies that handle credit card numbers. For
large companies, the PCI standard specifically references OWASP's as a
preferred methodology to secure web-applications. 

Food & drink are still being sorted out, but will be provided.

Location & Time
EchoStar is willing to host in the DTC area again, but some have
expressed an interest in something further North. Accuvant has offered
to provide a meeting location in downtown Denver. Keep in mind that this
means paid parking. 

So far, all meetings have been at 6:30. There was indication at the last
meeting that some people may find 7:00 or even 7:30 more convenient.

Please reply to me and vote on your preferred location & time. 

Future Meetings
Over the next several months, I would really enjoy seeing presentations
on AJAX security, .Net security, and performing security-related code
reviews. If you or someone in your organization is interested in
presenting on one of these topics, please let me know. If you have other
topics that you would like to present on, or would like to learn about,
also contact me. 


Thanks,
