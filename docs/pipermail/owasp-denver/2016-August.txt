************************************************************************

*WE ARE TRYING OUT A NEW LOCATION AT DAVE & BUSTER'S ON COLORADO **FOR OUR
AUGUST MEETUP.*

**********************************************************************

Please come join us for our OWASP Denver August meeting.  Enjoy some great
food, drinks and networking courtesy of Solutions II.  Come network
beforehand and after the presentation (which will start shortly after 6:00)

RSVP at:  https://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/

*TOPIC:*
*An Introduction to Machine Learning for Cybersecurity and Threat Hunting*

The use of machine learning is one of the most important new trends in
cybersecurity. In this session we?ll walk through an overview of machine
learning and the creation of a simple machine learning script in Python
that you can learn to find malicious activity in your HTTP proxy logs. At
the end of it all, you'll not only gain a useful tool to help you identify
things that your IDS and SIEM might have missed, but you?ll also have the
knowledge necessary to adapt that code to other uses as well.

*PRESENTERS:*


*David J. Bianco*

Before coming to work as a Security Architect and DFIR subject matter
expert at Sqrrl, David led the hunt team at Mandiant/FireEye, helping to
develop and prototype innovative approaches to detect and respond to
network attacks. Prior to that, he spent five years helping to build an
intel-driven detection & response program for General Electric (GE-CIRT).
He set detection strategies for a network of nearly 500 NSM sensors in over
160 countries and led response efforts for some of the company?s the most
critical incidents.


*Chris McCubbin*

Chris is the Director of Data Science for Sqrrl. He has extensive
experience with the Hadoop ecosystem and applying scientific computation
algorithms to real-world datasets. Previously, Chris developed Big Data
analysis tools for the Intelligence Community and applied artificial
intelligence techniques to unmanned vehicle systems. He holds a MS in
Computer Science and BS in Computer Science and Mathematics from the
University of Maryland.


*Ely Kahn*

Ely is a co-founder of Sqrrl. Previously, Ely served in a variety of
positions in the Federal Government, including Director of Cybersecurity at
the National Security Staff in White House, Deputy Chief of Staff at the
National Protection Programs Directorate in the Department of Homeland
Security, and Director of Risk Management and Strategic Innovation in the
Transportation Security Administration. Before his service in the Federal
Government, Ely was a management consultant with Booz Allen Hamilton. Ely
has a BA from Harvard University and a MBA from the Wharton School at the
University of Pennsylvania.

Subject: [Owasp-denver] Call for Training
Message-ID: <CANFTLBxvpkwS9Pqn6dQtr93VpRotTELRruba8NPp774jKv3p5A@mail.gmail.com>

The Denver OWASP chapter is looking to host a training day tentatively
scheduled for November 17th.  This will be a one day training with 2 or 3
simultaneous classes going on.  Cost per student is targeted to be $500
with a class size cap at 25 or 30 persons.  Funds raised from the training
will be split 40/60 (trainer/OWASP) where some funds go to the local
chapter and some funds go to the OWASP Foundation.  OWASP will arrange the
venue, food, bring all AV in, and conduct marketing for the event.

We are looking for hot current training.  So if you have or can develop a
one day training class, please submit your proposed class along with a bio
to me and I will forward this onto our selection committee.

Submissions must be received by September 9th.

Thanks!
