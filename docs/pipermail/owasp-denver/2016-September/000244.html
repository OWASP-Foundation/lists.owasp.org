<PRE>&quot;Back in the day&quot; the entire concept of software &quot;quality&quot; was foreign, and
no more a part of the Development Lifecycle than security is today.

Here's your chance to educate no-kidding Quality Assurance professionals
how to effectively integrate security into the quality and testing
programs, and to rub elbows with folks who spend every day trying to stamp
out bugs...
