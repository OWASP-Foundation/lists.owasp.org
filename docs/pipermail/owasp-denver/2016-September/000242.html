<PRE>************************************************************

WE WILL BE AT DAVE &amp; BUSTER'S ON COLORADO FOR OUR SEPTEMBER MEETUP.

************************************************************


Please come join us for our OWASP Denver meeting (RSVP at
<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP">http://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP</A>).  Enjoy some great food, drinks and
networking courtesy of Solutions II.  Come network beforehand and after the
presentation (which will start shortly after 6:00)

*TOPIC*:  The Business of Hacking / Attackers as our Competitors


Attackers are sophisticated. They are organized. We hear these statements a
lot but what do they mean to us? What does it mean to our businesses? When
we dig deeper into the &#8220;business of hacking,&#8221; we see that the attackers
have become almost corporate in their behavior. Their business looks a lot
like ours. Cyber criminals look to maximize their profits and minimize
risk. They have to compete on quality, customer service, price, reputation,
and innovation. The suppliers specialize in their market offerings. They
have software development lifecycles and are rapidly moving to Software as
a Service (SaaS) offerings. Our businesses overlap in so many ways that we
should start to look at these attackers as competitors.Join world-renowned
DNS expert Cricket Liu to hear the latest on threats to DNS infrastructure
and the mechanisms available to combat them. Cricket, Chief Infrastructure
Officer for Infoblox and author of DNS and BIND, will lead an interactive
discussion about current topics from DDoS attacks, cache poisoning and
malware threats, as well as examine the different methods to effectively
address these threats.

*PRESENTER*:  Neil Bryden

Neil Bryden is a Security Strategist for the Americas within the Enterprise
Security Product business unit at HPE.  Prior to joining HP in 2013, Mr.
Bryden served as the Global Information Security Officer and the US firm&#8217;s
Chief Information Security Officer for KPMG LLP. In this role, he held
executive-level responsibility for an information security program that
covered 110,000 employees in 140 countries. During his time at KPMG, he was
instrumental in maturing the information security program, including the
establishment of a software security assurance program, the development of
an information security controls architecture to enable greater business
flexibility while still controlling the risks, and the integration of an
information breach response program into the firm&#8217;s overall Crisis
Management Plan.
