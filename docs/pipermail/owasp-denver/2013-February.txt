Hello all,
We have the details for the OWASP Denver meeting on Feb 20th.
The details follow but you can register here:

Event Details
You are invited to OWASP Denver's February Meeting.

Hosting's is growing and going to build-out of our old meeting room. We
will no longer be able to meet there.  We thank Community College of
Aurora<http://denverowasp1302.eventbrite.com/#> for
hosting us for February's meeting at the Lowery Campus.
 See close-up map at:

Our speaker this month is Chris Roberts.  The Boulder OWASP chapter
suggested we bring him in to speak after their members were still talking
about his presentation 6 months after their meeting.  So thought we'd give
it a go.  Chris will spend some time talking about the evolution of hacking
and relaying some good stories along the way.


As always, we'd like to thank our chapter sponsor South Seas Corporation (
http://www.southseascorp.com/) for sponsoring our dinner for the evening.
 They brought a tasty roast pig last time and said we should look forward
to another good meal this month.
Please ensure you RSVP so that we can ensure we have enough food for the
meeting!  http://denverowasp1302.eventbrite.com

We look forward to seeing you there!
Your Board
