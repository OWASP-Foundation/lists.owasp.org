Hello Denver OWASP!!

I wanted to email you on two items.  First, there is a very cool conference
in Denver next week, RMISC (Rocky Mountain Information Security
Conference).  Please attend, info is at the bottom of this email.

Second, I wanted to invite you to register for our May meeting to be held
at Chinook Tavern.  This of course is courtesy of our great sponsor, *Solutions
II*.  Enjoy some great food, drinks and networking!

Frank Vianzon will be presenting on the oft-overlooked subject, recon.

Reconnaissance - understanding your target is a presentation on the most
forgotten part of penetration testing.  We will start by covering the
basics of reconnaissance including focused google searches and then
continue to other tools such as recon-ng and shodanHQ.

 Frank Vianzon works at Hitachi Data Systems as a Sr. Information Security
Specialist focusing on network and server vulnerabilities.  He has been
working in Information Technology for over two decades with the last decade
focused on security.  Frank is certified by the SANS Institute in GCWN
(Windows Security) for the last ten years and also GPEN (Ethical Hacking
and Penetration Testing) for which he is a mentor for the course.
Frank also teaches at both Red Rocks Community College and the Community
College of Aurora.  He teaches a wide range of classes including CompTIA
A+, CompTIA Network+, Ethical Hacking, Network Defense and Counter Measures
and Enterprise Security.
