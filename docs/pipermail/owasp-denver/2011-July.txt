Greetings David,

My name is Alex Horan and I am a Product Manager with Core Security
Technologies. As the leader of your OWASP Chapter, I wanted to offer you
and your chapter members a chance to try the new product from Core
Security; "WebVerify". This recent product release is focused at the Web
Application testing community and I hope to strengthen our ties to the
OWASP community.

WebVerify is from the same company that brought Core Impact Professional
to market.   WebVerify is an automated security testing product that
provides demonstrable and actionable intelligence on an organization's
exploitable web application vulnerabilities and the resulting security
implications for their broader operations. WebVerify uses techniques
similar to those employed by actual attackers. With WebVerify, you can
not only identify exploitable application weaknesses, but also verify
the exposure of related databases, the web server, backend network
devices, and even end users against subsequent attacks.

Now that you have a better understanding of WebVerify and its'
capabilities, I would like to offer you and your chapter members the
opportunity to use WebVerify for a one-week period at no cost. I have
arranged this program because I believe that this product closely aligns
with OWASP's mission statement to: "...make application security
visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions
about true application security risks."

 If you think this offer would provide value to your members let me know
and I can send you the details for you to forward to your members.

If you have suggestions for other ways I could work with or provide
value to your chapter, please do not hesitate to let me know.

I look forward to hearing from you,

Alex

 

Alex Horan
