Subject: [Owasp-denver] July OWASP Meeting Scheduled for Wednesday, 16 July,
 6pm at Raytheon Polar, Centennial CO
Message-ID: <48752BB0.9040509@owasp.org>

Blackhat veteran David Byrne and Denver chapter leader Eric Duprey will 
be presenting their latest work: Grendel!

Grendel is a tool they developed to automate many aspects of appsec 
testing. During this presentation, they will show how to use Grendel to 
accelerate webapp pen testing.

Bring a laptop with an optical drive, as a LiveCD will be provided which 
includes Grendel and a target application.

Developers are encouraged to attend, as Grendel can be used to find many 
common flaws in applications.  We all know that fixing bugs in DEV is 
significantly cheaper than fixing them after a production penetration test.

Agenda:

6-6:30 Dinner (at RPSC; pizza provided by TrustWave.)
6:30 - 6:40 Chapter business
6:40 - 8:00 Presentation and Q&A

Following the meeting we will have informal discussions over beverages 
at JD's Bait Shop in Centennial.

Raytheon Polar is located at 7400 S. Tucson Way, Englewood, CO 80112.

Folks,

Apologies for that last post.  This list is created primarily for the 
distribution of information related to Denver OWASP meetings and 
conferences.

We have occasionally supported the submission of other information, 
including job postings, but only if they are specifically focused on 
app-sec.

We have enabled moderation on the list, and for future reference, the 
only job postings appropriate for submission here are positions with a 
focus on app-sec, posted by principal OWASP members (i.e. not recruiters).

Thanks for your patience.

- DC

All,

A quick reminder that our July Denver OWASP meeting is scheduled for

pleasure of playing with pre-release versions of the Grendel scanner, 
and it's very powerful, yet easy to use.

Please remember to bring a laptop.  Live-CD's will be provided so that 
participants can follow along with the presentation in realtime.

I look forward to seeing you all on Wednesday evening.  If you haven't 
RSVP'd yet and intend to attend, please drop me a note.

Cheers,
