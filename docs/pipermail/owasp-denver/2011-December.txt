Subject: [Owasp-denver] New chapter leader!
Message-ID: <4EDD10B8.7060701@owasp.org>

All,

I'm very pleased to announce that Andy Lewis, founder of the Boulder
chapter and the original FROC conference has decided to jump back into
the fray and take the reins for OWASP Colorado.

Andy is already communicating with those of you that offered to join the
chapter board and help to run the chapter.  If you wish to get involved
but haven't yet expressed your interest please contact Andy directly.

I've seen the plan that Andy's putting in place to ensure that this year
is our best yet and am very excited that he's back.  Please join me in
welcoming him back to OWASP!

Thanks!

DC
