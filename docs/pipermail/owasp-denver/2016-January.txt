Hello Colorado OWASP community!

Please vote for an OWASP tool at the Toolswatch Best Security Tool survey:

http://www.toolswatch.org/2015/11/vote-for-2015-best-security-tool/

If you're not familiar with OWASP tools, please consider attending SnowFROC
(www.snowfroc.com) on Feb 18th to learn a little.
In addition to the normal presos there will be a hands-on/"101" parallel
track that will expose you to many tools.

Thanks!
Andy

PS: OWASP tools are open-source community efforts, and it would be nice for
the project teams to receive well-deserved recognition.  Here are OWASP
tools rankings from previous years:

2014:
2. ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)
5. Xenotix
7 OWTF

and in 2013:
1. ZAP
5. Xenotix
10. O-SAFT

Please RSVP at http://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/228365435/.

We will hear a great presentation on* XPath Injection* by Luis Torres.

XPath is a language that has been designed and developed to operate on data
that is described with XML. The XPath injection allows an attacker to
inject XPath elements in a query that uses XML. Threat agent goals are
often aim to circumvent authentication and/or access information in an
unauthorized manner.

Developers today use XPaths to perform actions over XML based documents,
however insecure coding practices could lead allow for injection issues to
surface in web applications. Blind XPath Injection retrieves information by
making true/false interrogations with web applications, however they mostly
focus on retrieving current query information, skipping sensitive
information on XML nodes outside of current query requests. This
presentation will extend beyond these blind injection attacks and discuss
how to retrieve the entire XML document, using Blind XPath Injection
techniques.
