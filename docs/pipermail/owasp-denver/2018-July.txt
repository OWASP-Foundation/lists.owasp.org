TOPIC: Automation and Open Source, Turning the Tide on Attackers

The security world is still trying figure out how to deal with the
overwhelming number of security alerts and data deluge most SOCs are faced
with and then turn them into intelligence that is useful and actionable.
Throwing more people and tech at the problem has proven to be ineffective
and costly. In this talk I walk through methods and tools (that you can
actually employ) to turn the tide in your favor and create a security team
that proactively deals with threats.
