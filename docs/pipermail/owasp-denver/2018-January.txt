*TOPIC: Adding an S to SDLC: Building a plan for ?going left?*

As application security programs mature and grow, the number of concerns
they are trying to address increases quickly. Part of this increase in the
number concerns is attributable to the now popular ideas of Agile
development, DevSecOps, and "moving security left". In this presentation, I
will present a framework to organize these concerns and help an
organization build a plan that fits their needs and capabilities. I will
focus on the prerequisite concepts and information that are passed over by
the majority of security organizations that are trying (but struggling) to
keep up with their development counterparts, but seem to be well understood
by the organizations who are having the most success. I will discuss the
state of security scanning products and why understanding how they work,
what they can do, and what they can?t do is key to building an assessment
process that provides real security value to your organization and the
software that it produces.

*PRESENTER: Zach Jones*

Zach Jones is the Senior Manager of Static Code Analysis within WhiteHat
Security?s Threat Research Center. Zach joined WhiteHat as an ethical
hacker in 2011 and has since had the opportunity to deliver and develop
services in both DAST and SAST gaining expertise in scanning, manual
testing, and source code review. Prior to joining WhiteHat, Zach was a
systems architect for a Houston based online photo-lab, and before that
spent several years as an aspiring golf professional. In 2013, Zach joined
WhiteHat?s research and development team to begin operationalizing
WhiteHat?s new Sentinel Source offering. Since then, he has built an
international team that is responsible for scanning and verifying results
for over 250 million lines of code daily, covering five programming
languages. Currently, Zach?s primary role beyond managing the service
delivery team for Sentinel Source involves working directly with WhiteHat?s
largest customers to implement SAST within their SDLC helping development
and security organizations partner better to deliver more secure software.
