*TOPIC*:*Mobile pitfalls to avoid: Breaking down the OWASP Top 10 Mobile
Risks*
Security teams and mobile developers have critical tasks when building and
deploying secure mobile apps at today's global enterprises. Data shows that
companies are deploying code with incredible speed -- measured in days,
hours, and minutes. As code gets deployed more quickly, teams need to write
code securely and avoid mobile application pitfalls such as insecure data
storage, insecure communication, reverse engineering and more.

Join Jon Porter as he breaks down the OWASP Mobile Top 10 Risks with steps
your development teams can take to write, test, and release secure mobile
app and show some of these potential exploits in action.

Attendees will be guided to leverage the Secure Mobile Development Best
Practices following the discussion.

*PRESENTER*: Jon Porter

Jon creates successful deployments for NowSecure customers, acting as a
liaison between product, engineering, and sales teams. His experience
focuses on information architecture, technical implementations, and
customized solutions for enterprise clients. Jon holds a M.S. in Computer,
Information, and Network Security from DePaul University with a B.A. in
Computer Science from Eastern Kentucky University.


*When*: Wednesday, May 17, 2017 5:30 PM

*Where*: Dave & Buster's
2000 S Colorado Blvd
Denver, CO

 Hi All - I'm forwarding this because there can definitely be overlapping
interests between QA & AppSec folks.  SQUADCO is a *great* resource for
testers and they've invited OWASP folks to speak to them about security on
several occasions.  If you're not making any headway convincing your
Developers and Testers to adopt secure coding/testing, here's a chance to
walk a mile in their shoes and learn to speak their language.

All the best,

Andy
