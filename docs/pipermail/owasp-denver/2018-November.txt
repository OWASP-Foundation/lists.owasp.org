Subject: [Owasp-denver] Reminder,
	OWASP Denver Meeting this Wed at Chinook Tavern
Message-ID: <CANFTLBy8v0dFu10RRNwVS=+L240+0JtGe7dh7o4psQaX3KWmfw@mail.gmail.com>

RSVP at https://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/256227793

We're having our November meeting early due to avoid any Thanksgiving
conflicts.  Please come join us for our OWASP Denver meeting. Enjoy some
great food, drinks and networking.  *PLEASE NOTE, WE ARE RETURNING TO
CHINOOK TAVERN FOR THIS MEETING.*

Since this is the last planned meeting of the year, we will be hosting a
dual track meeting.  One track will be utilizing Security Innovation's
CMD+CTRL Capture The Flag (CTF) platform.  Participants should bring their
own laptops and prepare to have some fun with some cool challenges.  More
information on this below.  The second track will be a highly interactive
panel discussion.  We look forward to some spirited talks and interspersed
with insights on how the CTF is going.
------
This CTF will be an immersive and fun learning environment where you will
exploit your way through hundreds of vulnerabilities that lurk in business
applications today ? and learn quickly that attack and defense are about
thinking on your feet.

Unlike gamification that mimics how an application should respond, this CTF
comprises real websites, traffic, technologies, and vulnerabilities that
represent actual application behavior. This realism brings the immediate
gratification and long-term memory benefits of ?learning by doing" that
teams need in order to protect the enterprise.
