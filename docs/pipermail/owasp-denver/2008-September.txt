Centralized Security Functionality In a .NET World ? The OWASP .NET
ESAPI Project

The Enterprise Security Application Programming Interface, or ESAPI, is
a one-stop security shop for developers looking to implement security
mechanisms in their code. The brainchild of Jeff Williams, one of the
founders of OWASP, the ESAPI is an open source project that has gained
traction with organizations looking to implement secure applications
using tried and tested code that is also well organized and consistent.
It includes functionality for validating and encoding data,
authenticating and authorizing users, logging, error handling, and more.
The API includes a Java reference implementation that can be extended to
allow any organization to integrate security functionality into their
Java/JEE applications.

But what about .NET? Many organizations are banking on the powerful
Microsoft programming framework to help them deliver robust and secure
software. However, like Java, .NET tends to leave it up to the end-user
programmers to get security code right. The OWASP .NET ESAPI project
intends to help .NET developers avoid introducing security
vulnerabilities into their code by providing a full port of the original
ESAPI project from Java to C#.

This talk will explore the gains, gripes, and gotchas of converting the
ESAPI to .NET from the .NET ESAPI project lead himself. It will discuss
features of the .NET frameworks security model, key differences between
the Java and .NET platforms, and ASP.NET web security issues.
Additionally, future ideas for .NET specific functionality will be
proposed and discussed. Participation and feedback from the attendees is
expected and encouraged.
Speaker: Alex Smolen of Foundstone

Cheers,

Subject: [Owasp-denver] Back from OWASP NYC!
Message-ID: <48E27FCD.8010102@owasp.org>

Folks,

I've just returned from New York and have lots of interesting info to
share from the Appsec '08 conference.

As you may have heard, Jeremiah and RSnake's presentation on
Clickjacking was squelched at the request of Adobe.  However, what I can
tell you is that the flaw they uncovered is a browser design flaw, so
don't expect any patches soon.  If you're concerned, try the NoScript
firefox plugin (noscript.net), which appears to mitigate the
Clickjacking attack.

On an unrelated note, if there is anybody from Jeppesen on the list, or
if you know anybody responsible for security there, could you please
contact me off list?

I look forward to seeing all of you on Wednesday Oct 15th at RPSC at 6pm
for Alex Smolen's talk on the .NET ESAPI.  I am quite impressed by the
original Java ESAPI so am very excited to see Alex's talk.



Cheers,

DC

Subject: [Owasp-denver] SnowFROC: Call For Logos
Message-ID: <3478.49252.qm@web403.biz.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi All - we're putting together a Front-Range OWASP Conference for March 5th.  We're calling it
SnowFROC and we're hoping to make it a fantastic annual event.

A fantastic event needs a fantastic logo.  Please help by creating a logo and sending a jpeg to
Kathy Thaxton at kthaxton at businesspartnersolutions and to me at owasp at justplainpix.com with a
subject line "Logo contest" and your contact info.  If you're not "the artistic type" but you know
someone who is, please forward this message on.

Here are some examples.  I'd REALLY like to have something of the same quality - please help!

What does the winner get?  At this point I can guarantee that the winner will be recognized during
SnowFROC as well as on the SnowFROC site and both Chapter websites.  I can promise we'll try to do
something else special for the winner but can't guarantee what that will be (stay tuned).

Note:  if you are interested in volunteering to be on the Panel of Judges please contact me or
Kathy Thaxton (Events Director, cc:'d on this message)

Thanks and good luck!
Andy

Moderators for the Houston and San Antonio lists - I've posted to your boards because I've spoken
about SnowFROC to both Chapter Leaders at previous meetings.  If you choose not to publish this I
completely understand, but we hope that folks from your Chapters will come out to SnowFROC as a
convenient excuse to come ski in Colorado :-)
