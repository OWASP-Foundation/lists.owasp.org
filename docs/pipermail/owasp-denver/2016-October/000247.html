<PRE>Please come join us for our OWASP Denver meeting.  *Enjoy some great food,
drinks and networking courtesy of Solutions II
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.solutions-ii.com/">http://www.solutions-ii.com/</A>&gt;.*  Come network beforehand and after the
presentation (which will start shortly after 6:00).

*TOPIC*:  *An Introduction to Machine Learning for Cybersecurity and Threat
Hunting *

The use of machine learning is one of the most important new trends in
cybersecurity. In this session we&#8217;ll walk through an overview of machine
learning and the creation of a simple machine learning script in Python
that you can learn to find malicious activity in your HTTP proxy logs. At
the end of it all, you'll not only gain a useful tool to help you identify
things that your IDS and SIEM might have missed, but you&#8217;ll also have the
knowledge necessary to adapt that code to other uses as well.

*PRESENTERS*:  *Ely Kahn, David J. Bianco, Chris McCubbin*

Ely served in a variety of positions in the Federal Government, including
Director of Cybersecurity at the National Security Staff in White House,
Deputy Chief of Staff at the National Protection Programs Directorate in
the Department of Homeland Security, and Director of Risk Management and
Strategic Innovation in the Transportation Security Administration. Before
his service in the Federal Government, Ely was a management consultant with
Booz Allen Hamilton. Ely has a BA from Harvard University and a MBA from
the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

Chris has extensive experience with the Hadoop ecosystem and applying
scientific computation algorithms to real-world datasets. Previously, Chris
developed Big Data analysis tools for the Intelligence Community and
applied artificial intelligence techniques to unmanned vehicle systems. He
holds a MS in Computer Science and BS in Computer Science and Mathematics
from the University of Maryland.

David led the hunt team at Mandiant/FireEye, helping to develop and
prototype innovative approaches to detect and respond to network attacks.
Prior to that, he spent five years helping to build an intel-driven
detection &amp; response program for General Electric (GE-CIRT). He set
detection strategies for a network of nearly 500 NSM sensors in over 160
countries and led response efforts for some of the company&#8217;s the most
critical incidents.
