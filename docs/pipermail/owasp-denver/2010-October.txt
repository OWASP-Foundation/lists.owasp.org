Topic Summary

The session will discuss why so many IT organizations are getting "blind sided" by breaches and security incidents, in spite of a large investment in security technology.  But, more importantly, this will be a discussion of some best known methods for approaches and techniques to minimize the chance that you will experience a breach without detecting it and be able to quickly assess the impact when an attack (from any source) impacts your data assets and IT infrastructure.  Many of the approaches discussed are based on the widely read "Visible Ops Security Handbook," as well as industry guidance and best known methods from the speaker's work with the IT Process Institute, the Institute of Internal Auditors, and information gleaned through advising companies on IT security and operational practices worldwide.
