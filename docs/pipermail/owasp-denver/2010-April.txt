With the increasing set of information security threats facing today's
businesses, it is vital to stay up to speed on current technology,
successful security models and the most high-profile compliance issues.
Managers and CIOs want to stay compliant and prevent security breaches that
might put their company in the paper. Audit professionals want to make sure
they can prove compliance, within budget, while technical-level
professionals just want to know it's going to work.

The 4th Annual Rocky Mountain Information Security Conference is the only
conference of its kind in the Rocky Mountain region. A convenient,
affordable one-day knowledge-builder for IT security, audit and compliance
professionals at all levels. Learn from the best and network with peers!

Unfortunately, I'm going to be out of town for this meeting, but I highly recommend it for anyone that works with PCI. Bob Russo is basically in charge of the PCI-DSS, so it's a great opportunity to ask questions directly to the source.
