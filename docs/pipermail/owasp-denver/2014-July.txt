	Chapter meeting
Message-ID: <CANFTLByJ09SyTQyNkqEhtmuF8q1CNcYVbJ41HExJVUN6kpOHew@mail.gmail.com>

Please come join us for our July OWASP Denver Meeting.  *Enjoy some great

http://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/192080922/.  Wednesday July 16th
at Chinook Tavern.  6:00 to 8:00.

*Presentation:*

Static vulnerability analysis is the practice of testing non-running
software for application vulnerabilities. It is often referred to as SAST,
white box testing, or automated code review. In this session we will cover
some of the hows and whys of static analysis and deep dive some of the
common issues users of SAST technologies often encounter. Topics will
include data flow analysis and taint propagation, scan noise, and partial
code scanning, specifically around OWASP Top 10 issues. The material should
provide value to anyone with an interest in application security, not just
static analysis practitioners.

Colorado?s most beloved traditions. With the state?s rich history of
brewing and esteemed reputation in the national craft beer scene, no
Denver-based conference would be complete without an homage to this
longstanding local pastime. Anticipate fermented creations of all
persuasions made by brewers from near and far alike in the name of honor,
Rocky Mountain pride, and some really cool prizes.

We?ll be giving awards for Best of Show, People?s Choice, Sponsors Choice,
and more, so show up to sample some delicious one-of-a-kind brews, vote for
your favorite, and enjoy the company of visitors from across the nation.
