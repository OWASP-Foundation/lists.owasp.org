Subject: [Owasp-denver] AppsecDC coming up Nov10-13th
Message-ID: <4ABA52E3.1060802@owasp.org>

Greetings!

A quick reminder that AppsecDC is right around the corner.  The
organizers have done a great job of putting together a super
professional conference with a great lineup.  They are really raising
the quality bar higher for OWASP conferences!

http://appsecdc.org/

Early bird registration ($295 for OWASP members, $345 for others, $195
for students) closes this week!

I'd appreciate it if anybody who is planning to attend could please
email me as this year chapter leaders are being rewarded for encouraging
local chapter members to attend.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are also looking for presenters for our next meetings.  Please
contact me or Eric if you're interested.


Thanks!

I'm sure that AppsecDC will be a great conference (I'm going), but I think it's worth pointing out that there are a number of speakers at AppsecDC that also spoke at SnowFROC earlier this year. That's a good indication of how well SnowFROC was organized. We are very lucky to have such a great application conference in Denver. The fact that it was free AND included free food & beer makes it even more amazing.
