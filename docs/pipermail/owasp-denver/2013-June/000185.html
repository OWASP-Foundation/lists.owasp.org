<PRE>First, thank you to all for attending last night's OWASP Denver meeting.
 Aaron Cure gave a nice presentation on common vulnerabilities found in
applications, demonstrated exploits and provided mitigation steps.  Thanks
to South Seas for supplying a great dinner of beef brisket for us.  And
thanks to the University of Denver for hosting us.

In July, Jim Manico (VP Whitehat Security and Global OWASP board member)
will presenting on more secure coding techniques.  Bring your developers
along.  We will be at Chinook Tavern by Fiddlers Green.  South Seas will
again provide a great meal and we are looking forward to being able to
relax with some beers at the meeting.

Wanted to let you know that Boulder OWASP has a great presentation tonight

*Gene Kim* is a multiple award winning CTO, researcher and author. He was
founder and CTO of Tripwire, which commercialized the open source software
he wrote in 1992 with Dr. Gene Spafford at Purdue University. He is the
author of &#8220;The Visible Ops Handbook,&#8221; and &#8220;The Security Visible Ops
Handbook,&#8221;which has sold over 200K copies to date. Gene is also the author
of The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business
Win.

Gene&#8217;s area of passion is helping companies build super-tribes where
Development, IT Operations, Product and Project Management and Information
Security simultaneously maximize throughput of features from &#8220;code
complete&#8221; to &#8220;in production,&#8221; without causing chaos and disruption to the
IT environment. He&#8217;s helped some of the largest Internet properties, such
as Microsoft, Yahoo!, AOL and Microsoft companies he&#8217;s worked with
Microsoft. He loves finding and fixing bottlenecks which impede and
frustrate the entire organization, enabling management from each tribe to
achieve the greater organizational goals.

*Why We Need DevOps Now*
Gene will present his findings from an ongoing study of how high-performing
IT organizations simultaneously deliver stellar service levels and deliver
fast flow of new features into the production environment. To successfully
deliver against what on the surface appear to be conflicting objectives,
(i.e. preserving service levels while introducing significant amounts of
change into production), requires creating a highly-coordinated collection
of teams where Development, QA, IT Operations, as well as Product
Management and Information Security genuinely work together to solve
business objectives.
Gene will describe what successful transformations look like, and how those
transformations were achieved from a software development and service
operations perspective. He will draw upon fourteen years of research of
high-performing IT organizations, as well as work he's done since 2008 to
help some of the largest Internet companies increase feature flow and
production stability through applications of DevOps principles.

I sincerely hope to see you there!
