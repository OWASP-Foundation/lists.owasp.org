All,

As a service to our membership and to the companies who need good
information security talent, I wanted to start sharing some of the job
postings I periodically am alerted to.  Not wanting to flood this list with
too many emails, I'll restrict the postings to once a month.  Once with our
normal bimonthly meeting announcements and once during the off-months when
we don't have meetings.  Hopefully this is frequent enough to relate
(relatively) current openings without inundating our membership with too
many posts.

That being said, we do have the inaugural job posting from Sports
Authority.  Good chance to work with a great team as an Information
Security Analyst (Analyst I).  Check it out at:
