presentation (which will start shortly after 6:00).

*TOPIC*:  *An Introduction to Machine Learning for Cybersecurity and Threat
Hunting *

The use of machine learning is one of the most important new trends in
cybersecurity. In this session we?ll walk through an overview of machine
learning and the creation of a simple machine learning script in Python
that you can learn to find malicious activity in your HTTP proxy logs. At
the end of it all, you'll not only gain a useful tool to help you identify
things that your IDS and SIEM might have missed, but you?ll also have the
knowledge necessary to adapt that code to other uses as well.

*PRESENTERS*:  *Ely Kahn, David J. Bianco, Chris McCubbin*

Ely served in a variety of positions in the Federal Government, including
Director of Cybersecurity at the National Security Staff in White House,
Deputy Chief of Staff at the National Protection Programs Directorate in
the Department of Homeland Security, and Director of Risk Management and
Strategic Innovation in the Transportation Security Administration. Before
his service in the Federal Government, Ely was a management consultant with
Booz Allen Hamilton. Ely has a BA from Harvard University and a MBA from
the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

Chris has extensive experience with the Hadoop ecosystem and applying
scientific computation algorithms to real-world datasets. Previously, Chris
developed Big Data analysis tools for the Intelligence Community and
applied artificial intelligence techniques to unmanned vehicle systems. He
holds a MS in Computer Science and BS in Computer Science and Mathematics
from the University of Maryland.

David led the hunt team at Mandiant/FireEye, helping to develop and
prototype innovative approaches to detect and respond to network attacks.
Prior to that, he spent five years helping to build an intel-driven
detection & response program for General Electric (GE-CIRT). He set
detection strategies for a network of nearly 500 NSM sensors in over 160
countries and led response efforts for some of the company?s the most
critical incidents.

*Course: Hacking the OWASP Top 10 (by Aaron Cure)*

Learn to identify the OWASP Top 10/CWE 25 vulnerabilities, and how to
exploit them. Students will be introduced to the vulnerabilities, see
demo's and run exploits live in a VM environment. Mitigation strategies
will be discussed in a programing language agnostic format, and no
programming experience is required.

*Class: ZAP Your Web APP (by Serge Borso) *
*- Getting the most out of the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) for the
security professional *
This class will focus on using ZAP to assess a web application in a
real-world environment. There will be six hands-on labs aimed at exploring
the rich features of the tool with the goal of discovering flaws in a web
application and exploiting them in a meaningful way. Labs include account
enumeration and brute forcing, SQL Injection, XSS, XSRF and command
injection all with bonus material to drive home the concepts and for
mastery of the tool.
