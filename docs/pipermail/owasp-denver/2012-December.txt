Confronting Cyber Risk from Insecure Software


[cid:image001.png at 01CDD302.A01812E0]



Invitation-Only Moderated Discussion with
Chris Wysopal, CTO & Co-Founder, Veracode.
Thursday, December 6th - 5:00pm | Elway's Downtown, The Ritz-Carlton

[cid:image003.jpg at 01CDD302.A01812E0]Cybersecurity is a rapidly growing global concern, and firewalls and defensive technologies are no longer enough to keep your enterprise safe from attack. You've done a lot to secure the network but the cyber threat is quickly moving beyond this perimeter to the application layer.

Join speaker Chris Wysopal, CTO and Co-Founder Veracode, author of The Art of Software Security Testing and contributing author to the SANS/CWE Most Dangerous Software Errors, for an exclusive, invitation-only dinner and moderated discussion on how enterprises can better understand and reduce security risks associated with insecure software.

Topics for discussion:

 *   The State of Software Security
 *   Managing the Risk from Vendor-Supplied Software
 *   Mobile Security Strategies BYOD and Beyond

The roundtable discussion will be followed by a private dinner along with a screening of the Denver Broncos vs. Oakland Raiders game in a private dining room.

RSVP: For more information and to RSVP, please contact Stacy Thayer at sthayer at veracode.com<mailto:sthayer at veracode.com>. Space is limited, so please RSVP by November 16th to reserve your seat.

Subject: [Owasp-denver] OWASP SnowFROC Capture the Flag Theme Survey!
Message-ID: <CAJJX4hO-0ztrtUDbfvSs0w-a_iZz+O+x53=YSQs4YRJXEtwYpA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey folks!

As most of you know, this year's SnowFROC will have a capture the flag
event. Super exciting! As part of this effort, we would love to gather your
feedback on what the theme of the capture the flag event should be! This
will be a two part process, starting with the survey below, and followed up
with a second survey once we've whittled down the options in mid-January!

Thanks in advance for taking a few seconds to share your input!
