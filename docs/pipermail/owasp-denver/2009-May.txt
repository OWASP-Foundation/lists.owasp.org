program.  Given the current economy, (heightened risk and an often-limited
security budget) these issues are increasingly vital.

Title:  Compliance while under siege: justifying security spending for the
holes in your defenses.

Presenters: Dr. Joseph McComb, CISSP, CISA, G7799, CHSS and Daniel Weiske,
CISSP, CISA, CAP, NSA-IAM

Synopsis:  This presentation will show how to integrate a compliance
framework into application security testing to produce an effective
mechanism for presenting risk. Regulations, including security breach
notification legislation, HIPAA, FISMA and other regulations specify
penalties for failing to safeguard specific types of information. This
presentation will demonstrate how to weave regulatory frameworks into the
application testing process and how to quantify risk based upon penalties
and ease of exploitation.  Using real world examples, the presenters will
show how this methodology can be used to justify security testing as a
necessary expenditure for a secure environment.
