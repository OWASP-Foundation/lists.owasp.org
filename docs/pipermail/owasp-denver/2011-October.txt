OWASP Denver,

I'm teaching two classes on Cloud Security in Denver on 8-9 Nov. I thought
some of your membership might be interested in attending. The classes
prepare students for the Cloud Security Alliance Certificate of Cloud
Security Knowledge exam.

The Basic class is one day and provides students a comprehensive one day
review of cloud security fundamentals and prepares them to take the Cloud
Security Alliance CCSK certification exam. The cost of the Basic Class is
$695 and includes a token to take the CCSK exam.

The Plus class builds upon the CCSK Basic class with expanded material and
extensive hands-on activities with a second day of training. Students will
learn to apply their knowledge as they perform a series of exercises as they
complete a scenario bringing a fictional organization securely into the
cloud. The cost of the Plus class is $1195 and includes a token to take the
CCSK exam.

I'll have a representative at next weeks ISSA meeting to provide more
information on the class and to answer any questions. More info and
registration links are below. Please let me know if you have any questions.

As an OWASP Member, I'm offer the following discount to OWASP members:

Basic Class $50 off
Plus Class $100 off
