Subject: [Owasp-denver] No *Denver* Sept OWASP meeting
Message-ID: <CAM7+66OcCFwPU4zFbgcqPjfFX3VHH_3HvqYiJGrs83JqeXL5cA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All - just a heads up.  After a long summer hiatus we got caught up
in logistics and I wasn't able to get a meeting set up.
Best bet is that our next and final meeting will be in October.
Stay tuned...
Andy
