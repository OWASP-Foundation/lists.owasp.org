&gt;<i> Hey folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have had several new subscribers in the past week so I figured I would
</I>&gt;<i> send out a reminder about our meeting one week from today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -----
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On behalf of the OWASP Denver Chapter I would like to invite you to attend
</I>&gt;<i> our first Denver OWASP meeting since June of 2007.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The event will be held Wednesday, the 20th of February at the offices of
</I>&gt;<i> Raytheon Polar Services in Centennial, CO. from 6pm to 8pm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are very excited to welcome Michael Sutton from SPI Dynamics (HP), who
</I>&gt;<i> will deliver our keynote presentation.  I will also be delivering a short
</I>&gt;<i> presentation of highlights from the OWASP/WASC Nov 2007 Conference in San
</I>&gt;<i> Jose, CA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Full details on the event are on the website, at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denver#Next_Meeting.">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denver#Next_Meeting.</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please RSVP to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-denver">dcampbell at owasp.org</A> so we can get an idea of how many
</I>&gt;<i> attendees to expect.  (Note if you've already RSVP'd no need to do so
</I>&gt;<i> again).  Food will be provided courtesy of HP/SPI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that for CISSP folks, CPE's will be awarded for this event.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also please save the date 10 June 2008 for the Front Range OWASP
</I>&gt;<i> Conference (in partnership with BOULDER OWASP).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers!
