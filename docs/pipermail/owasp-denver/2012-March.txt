Subject: [Owasp-denver] SnowFROC - .NET Folks - THIS IS FOR YOU :-)
Message-ID: <CB7CC0CA.1320A%alewis@owasp.org>

Hi All ? for all of you who have come up to me asking ?where?s the .Net?? I
have news.  It looks like we?ll be able to have Jerry Hoff, VP of Static
Code Analysis at Whitehat, come to SnowFROC to discuss the new

.Net Webgoat

For those of you who may not be familiar with webgoat, it is a deliberately
insecure app.  It is designed to be a puzzle and tutorial for learning to
code securely and how to test/pen-test for web app vulns.  This is the first
time it?s available for .Net folks.

Jerry Hoff Is going to discuss the new .Net version of webgoat, so all you
.Net developers will have a chance to TEACH YOURSELF how to code and test in
a way that Java developers have been able to do for years!
Please register for SnowFROC here:

Andy-
I don't see it listed in the note below but OWASP members will need to use a
discount code in order to get the 20% discount. That code is:?2012OWASP.
Sorry it didn't get included in the first email. If you could let the OWASP
members know that, it would be great. Thanks.
