Subject: [Owasp-denver] SnowFROC is this Thursday
Message-ID: <49ABD1B8.2020106@owasp.org>

Greetings all,

After a successful FROC in June of 2008, we are back in Denver, Colorado
USA on Thursday, 5 March 2009!

*This year we again present a full day, FREE multi-track conference,
which will provide valuable information for managers and executives as
well as developers and engineers.*

In 2008, we attracted a packed venue with our great AppSec speakers, and
we hope to achieve the same again in 2009. This year we organized the
conference to occur during the peak of the Colorado ski season, so that
speakers can head up to the nearby mountains before and/or after the
conference to enjoy some of the legendary snow.
