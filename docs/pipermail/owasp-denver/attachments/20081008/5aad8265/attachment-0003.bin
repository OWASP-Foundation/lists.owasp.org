DESCRIPTION:Centralized Security Functionality In a .NET World \n\nThe OWAS
 P .NET ESAPI Project The Enterprise Security Application Programming Interf
 ace\, or ESAPI\, is a one-stop security shop for developers looking to impl
 ement security mechanisms in their code. The brainchild of Jeff Williams\, 
 one of the founders of OWASP\, the ESAPI is an open source project that has
  gained traction with organizations looking to implement secure application
 s using tried and tested code that is also well organized and consistent. I
 t includes functionality for validating and encoding data\, authenticating 
 and authorizing users\, logging\, error handling\, and more. The API includ
 es a Java reference implementation that can be extended to allow any organi
 zation to integrate security functionality into their Java/JEE applications
 .\n\nBut what about .NET? Many organizations are banking on the powerful Mi
 crosoft programming framework to help them deliver robust and secure softwa
 re. However\, like Java\, .NET tends to leave it up to the end-user program
 mers to get security code right. The OWASP .NET ESAPI project intends to he
 lp .NET developers avoid introducing security vulnerabilities into their co
 de by providing a full port of the original ESAPI project from Java to C#.\
 n\nThis talk\, delivered by the leader of the .NET ESAPI project Alex Smole
 n\, will explore the gains\, gripes\, and gotchas of converting the ESAPI t
 o .NET from the .NET ESAPI project lead himself. It will discuss features o
 f the .NET frameworks security model\, key differences between the Java and
  .NET platforms\, and ASP.NET web security issues. Additionally\, future id
 eas for .NET specific functionality will be proposed and discussed. Partici
 pation and feedback from the attendees is expected and encouraged.\n\nMore 
 information is at http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denver\n\nThanks!\n\nDavid
  Campbell\n\n\nNOTE: if Wednesday or Centennial won't work for you\, Alex w
 ill be presenting on Tuesday\, 14 Oct in Broomfield. See link below for det
