Denver OWASP Members,

Have a few announcements, please read through them all.

First, our February meeting on wifi security is next week on Wednesday the
15th, please register at:

https://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/237542695/

*Topic:*
This talk will be a quick introduction to the protocols and WLAN channels,
focusing mainly on 2.4 and 5 GHz.  We'll cover different types of
interference, war driving, the infamous wifi Pineapple, then jump into the
use of Kismet as a wireless network detector. We'll look at why is Kismet
is able to get the info that it does (it's in plain text!) and how this
allows someone to do some recon and carry out a man in the middle attack.
When looking for evil twins, potential points of network intrusion or
vulnerable access points, it is crucial to look at the results of a decent
wifi analyzer to identify and tune wireless access points in order to
secure your network, no matter how large or small.

*Presenter:*
Keya Horiuchi is an engineer with AppliedTrust. She works on a variety of
projects around network security that include penetration tests,
vulnerability scans and various types of compliance. She thinks swimming
with sharks and capturing packets is fun and is diving into the onion and
barnyard-animal filled pool of network security monitoring.

===============================================

Our SNOWFROC conference is on March 16th at the Cable Center at the
University of Denver, please register at snowfroc.com.  We have great
speakers lined up, breakfast and lunch is provided along with happy hour.
All of this for $50/$60 (without/with OWASP membership).

===============================================
