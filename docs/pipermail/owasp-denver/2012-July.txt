Hi All - we've got a lot of PHP shops represented in our Chapters;
thought this might be of interest.
All the best,
Andy

Hello leaders,
I'm rebooting
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Security_Cheat_Sheet
and have currently added SQL and other injection specific issues.

Since PHP is very commonly used, and we have had a non-functional page
before this, I think we need to make sure the practices advertised in
this page are precise, then advise it to the community.

Please add any doubts/hints/feedbacks on the discussion page of the wiki.

-Abbas
