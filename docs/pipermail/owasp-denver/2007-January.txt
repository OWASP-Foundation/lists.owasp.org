As of today, I have only received 12 RSVPs for the Denver OWASP meeting on
Janurary 17. I hope that is just because people haven't had the chance to
send it, and does not reflect on the actual attendance. By the end of the
week, I need to submit a list of attendees to the security guards at
EchoStar. People that don't RSVP can still come in, but will have to be
manually signed in. To help things go smoothly, I'd like to minimize the
manual process. If you haven't decided about attending yet, please RSVP
anyway, there isn't a penalty for not coming. There is also plenty of space,
so don't pass on the meeting for fear of being cramped.

There will be a presentation on security in the System Development Lifecycle
(SDLC) and a presentation on Web Services security. The meeting is on
Wednesday, January 17 at EchoStar Satellite's headquarters. Directions can
be found here: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denver

Thanks,
David Byrne
