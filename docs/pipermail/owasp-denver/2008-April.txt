All,

I'm pleased to announce that next month the Denver OWASP chapter will be 
welcoming Ryan Barnett, who will be delivering our feature presentation:

"Virtual Patching for Web Applications with ModSecurity"

Fixing identified vulnerabilities in web application always requires
time. Organizations often do not have access to a commercial
application's source code and are at the vendor's mercy while waiting
for a patch. Even if they have access to the code, implementing a patch
in development takes time. This leaves a window of opportunity for the
attacker to exploit. External patching (also called "just-in-time
patching" and "virtual patching") is one of the biggest advantages of
web application firewalls as they can fix this problem externally. A 
fix for a specific vulnerability is usually very easy to design and in 
most cases it can be done in less than 15 minutes. This presentation 
will outline exactly when and where Virtual Patching is appropriate and 
will show the proper steps for their creation and testing.

Ryan C. Barnett is a recognized security thought leader and evangelist 
who frequently speaks with the media and industry groups.

He is the director of application security at Breach Security. He is 
also a faculty member for the SANS Institute, where his duties include 
instructor/courseware developer for Apache Security/Building a Web 
Application Firewall Workshop, Top 20 Vulnerabilities Team Member and 
Local Mentor for the SANS Track 4, "Hacker Techniques, Exploits and 
Incident Handling" course. He holds six SANS Global Information 
Assurance Certifications (GIAC): Intrusion Analyst (GCIA), Systems and 
Network Auditor (GSNA), Forensic Analyst (GCFA), Incident Handler 
(GCIH), Unix Security Administrator (GCUX) and Security Essentials (GSEC).

Mr. Barnett also serves as the team lead for the Center for Internet 
Security Apache Benchmark Project and is a member of the Web Application 
Security Consortium. His web security book, "Preventing Web Attacks with 
Apache? was published by Addison/Wesley in 2006.

The meeting will be held at Raytheon Polar Services, which was also the 
location of our February meeting.  Details available on the Denver OWASP 
wiki @ http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denver#Next_Meeting.

Also, please note that the Front Range OWASP conference is rapidly 
approaching.  Please save the date 10 June 08 for the conference.  More

All,

I'm pleased to announce that next month the Denver OWASP chapter will be

"Virtual Patching for Web Applications with ModSecurity"

Fixing identified vulnerabilities in web application always requires
time. Organizations often do not have access to a commercial
application's source code and are at the vendor's mercy while waiting
for a patch. Even if they have access to the code, implementing a patch
in development takes time. This leaves a window of opportunity for the
attacker to exploit. External patching (also called "just-in-time
patching" and "virtual patching") is one of the biggest advantages of
web application firewalls as they can fix this problem externally. A
    fix for a specific vulnerability is usually very easy to design and
in most cases it can be done in less than 15 minutes. This presentation
will outline exactly when and where Virtual Patching is appropriate and
will show the proper steps for their creation and testing.

Ryan C. Barnett is a recognized security thought leader and evangelist
who frequently speaks with the media and industry groups.

He is the director of application security at Breach Security. He is
also a faculty member for the SANS Institute, where his duties include
instructor/courseware developer for Apache Security/Building a Web

Local Mentor for the SANS Track 4, "Hacker Techniques, Exploits and

The meeting will be held at Raytheon Polar Services, which was also the

Michelle -

It should be posted soon.

FYI - I run Arsenal Security Group and we have a number of Application
Security Resources.  Is there anything I can do to help in the short term?

I'd be happy to have a call or setup a meeting so I can let eCollege know
more about Arsenal and our Application Security department.

Thanks,

Michael

Subject: [Owasp-denver] Symantec Biannual Internet Threat Assessment
 Highlights Web As Primary Delivery Vector for Malicious Code
Message-ID: <4803DABD.7010805@owasp.org>

http://www.symantec.com/business/theme.jsp?themeid=threatreport

 From the executive summary:
Malicious activity has become Web-based

In the past, traditional attack activity primarily used widespread, 
broadcast attacks aimed at computers deployed on networks. However, as 
administrators and vendors fortified perimeter defenses with tools
such as firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IP S), 
attackers responded by adopting new tactics. Instead of trying to 
penetrate networks with high-volume broadcast attacks, attackers have
adopted stealthier, more focused techniques that target individual 
computers through the World Wide Web. This may be driven, in part, by 
the fact that compromises that affect computers on enterprise
networks are increasingly likely to be discovered and shut down. On the 
other hand, activity that takes place on end users? computers and/or Web 
sites is less likely to be detected. As a result of these
considerations, Symantec has observed that the majority of effective 
malicious activity has become Web-based: the Web is now the primary 
conduit for attack activity.

Subject: [Owasp-denver] DENVER OWASP Meeting Tonight, 6pm at RPSC, Centennial,
	CO
Message-ID: <480632A7.7070104@owasp.org>

All,

A final reminder that we're looking forward to seeing you this evening!

Date: 16 April 08
Time: 6pm - 8pm
Location: Raytheon Polar Services, 7400 S. Tucson Way, Centennial, CO 80112.

--------------------------

All,

I'm pleased to announce that tonight the Denver OWASP chapter will be
welcoming Ryan Barnett, who will be delivering our feature presentation:

"Virtual Patching for Web Applications with ModSecurity"

Fixing identified vulnerabilities in web application always requires
time. Organizations often do not have access to a commercial
application's source code and are at the vendor's mercy while waiting
for a patch. Even if they have access to the code, implementing a patch
in development takes time. This leaves a window of opportunity for the
attacker to exploit. External patching (also called "just-in-time
patching" and "virtual patching") is one of the biggest advantages of
web application firewalls as they can fix this problem externally. A
    fix for a specific vulnerability is usually very easy to design and
in most cases it can be done in less than 15 minutes. This presentation
will outline exactly when and where Virtual Patching is appropriate and
will show the proper steps for their creation and testing.

Ryan C. Barnett is a recognized security thought leader and evangelist
who frequently speaks with the media and industry groups.

He is the director of application security at Breach Security. He is
also a faculty member for the SANS Institute, where his duties include
instructor/courseware developer for Apache Security/Building a Web
Application Firewall Workshop, Top 20 Vulnerabilities Team Member and
Local Mentor for the SANS Track 4, "Hacker Techniques, Exploits and
Incident Handling" course. He holds six SANS Global Information
Assurance Certifications (GIAC): Intrusion Analyst (GCIA), Systems and
Network Auditor (GSNA), Forensic Analyst (GCFA), Incident Handler
(GCIH), Unix Security Administrator (GCUX) and Security Essentials (GSEC).

Mr. Barnett also serves as the team lead for the Center for Internet
Security Apache Benchmark Project and is a member of the Web Application
Security Consortium. His web security book, "Preventing Web Attacks with
Apache? was published by Addison/Wesley in 2006.

The meeting will be held at Raytheon Polar Services, which was also the
location of our February meeting.  Details available on the Denver OWASP
wiki @ http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denver#Next_Meeting.

If you can't make tonight's meeting please check out the Boulder 
chapter's meeting tomorrow night, info here:
