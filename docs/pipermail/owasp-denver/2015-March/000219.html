<PRE>Please come join us for our OWASP Denver meeting that includes our DEVELOPER
CHALLENGE.  Enjoy some great food, drinks and networking courtesy of
Solutions II.

RSVP at:  <A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/220975420/">http://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/220975420/</A>

For the DEVELOPER CHALLENGE, we are asking everyone to bring members of
their development team to the free developer training (from 2:00 to
5:00) that will precede the general OWASP meeting (at its normal time of
6:00 to 8:00) .  The company that brings the most developers (to the
training or general meeting)will get a free happy hour (at a later date for
those developers attending) courtesy of Solutions II.

Free Developer Training (2 pm to 5 pm):

Jim Manico will conduct developer focused training.  Students will learn
how to code secure web solutions via defense-based code samples. As part of
this course, we will explore the use of third-party security libraries and
frameworks to speed and standardize secure development. We will highlight
production quality API's from various languages and frameworks that provide
production quality and scalable security controls

Normal OWASP Meeting (6 pm to 8 pm)

This general meeting will feature Jim Manico (Global OWASP Board Member and
author presenting on different aspects of application security.
