September 2010 ISACA meeting -  "Advanced Persistent Threats" by PricewaterhouseCoopers and MANDIANT

September 30, 2010
Sheraton Denver West
360 Union Boulevard
Lakewood, Colorado 80228

ISACA Denver Chapter is pleased to make an announcement regarding our first chapter meeting on September 30, 2010. We have an exciting topic from PricewaterhouseCoopers and MANDIANT on Advanced Persistent Threats. Please make your reservation today to participate and take advantage of this technical session.

Registration web page: http://www.isaca-denver.org/Chapter-Meetings/September-Chapter-Meeting.shtml

Topic Summary
PricewaterhouseCoopers

Concerns over Advanced Persistent Threats are growing by day, and it has been well documented that certain organized groups and governments have taken an active approach to creating cyber attack capabilities.

Today's security solutions are falling short due to their approach and architecture. The rise of espionage groups, such as the Shadow Network, using sophisticated methodologies to hack military and civilian networks, as well as governments employing Cyber Warfare as part of military offensives, highlight the need for a refreshed approach to information security.

We have reached a point where a new threat landscape has been created through the weaponizing of malware and creation of networks for the distribution of these attacks, such as the Russian Business Network ("RBN"). As a result there is an urgent need for a paradigm shift to combat these highly sophisticated and targeted attacks.

MANDIANT

The Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is very real and poses a major threat to corporations and government.  Mandiant has first-hand experience in combating the APT. Over the past several years, Mandiant has collected intelligence on APT tools, methods and environments that permit the APT to maintain persistence in the victim network.

Over the years, Mandiant has responded to many APT incidents involving heavily defended networks.  Reliance on technology to solve the problem of APT is only part of the solution.  Organizations must examine their culture, architecture, and defenses and understand how the APT exploits each area in order to harvest data and maintain persistence.

Weaknesses in any of the aforementioned areas will allow the APT attacker to establish a foothold in the network.  Once the foothold is established, removing their presence will be challenging unless you know what steps to take and which clues to look for.
