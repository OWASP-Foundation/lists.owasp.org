Message-ID: <CAFgr-jT1iR8yHrL3m-+No4YpARL5qjuojmNdfTBm5V29AQXMHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

We're looking to hire someone to do a 2 hour talk/Q&A to a team of web app
developers in Fort Collins.  Topics could include security basics, iOWASP
top 10, sanitation, injection...  Anything that you feel is relevant.

Let me know if you would be interested or know anyone that we could talk
to.  Thanks!
*David*

	(EFF) talk TONIGHT
Message-ID: <CANFTLBwD5chFu1grBJ0UoBt7JNyv+Fc9hUieK5ON0ipaxRX8hg@mail.gmail.com>

Denver OWASP Members,

I wanted to send out a quick blast to let you know that the Advocacy
Director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is giving a talk
tonight at 6:30 tonight at SecureSet (3801 Franklin St, Denver).  The
Electronic Frontier Foundation is the leading nonprofit organization
defending civil liberties in the digital world.  Shahid Buttar's talk will
be on defending digital rights.  Please see the attached for more details.

*Copyright doesn't sound like something connected to security - but it is.
Everyone from security researchers to startups are impacted by copyright
every day. Shahid Buttar from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) will
speak about serious changes in copyright law and what you need to know to
ensure your digital rights online.*



Also, as a quick reminder, we will be having our May meetup on May 18th at
Chinook Tavern, hope to see you there!


Steve Kosten
OWASP Denver Chapter Leader
