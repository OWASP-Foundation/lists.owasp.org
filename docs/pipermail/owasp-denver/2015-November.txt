Looking forward to a great presentation from Leif Drizler on *Bug Bounty
Programs.*

2015 saw unprecedented participation in crowdsourced bug bounty programs,
as big technology vendors like Google, Facebook and even Tesla have
embraced the need for bug bounty programs. Across the board, bug bounties
saw a sharp rise in both popularity and accessibility. For the first time,
companies beyond the enterprise technology space have been able to
participate in wide scale public or private bug bounties.

In this talk, Leif will outline the findings from a three year report that
analyzes vulnerability and community data to demonstrate the rapid
evolution of the bug bounty economy.

Drawing from more than 40,000 bug submissions and an ever-expanding
researcher community totaling more than 20,000 researchers, attendees will
learn about the top vulnerabilities found, the fluctuating value of a bug,
who the researchers are and general trends observed like the growth of
invitation-only programs. In addition, Leif will cover best practices for
attendees looking to start their own bug bounty program.
