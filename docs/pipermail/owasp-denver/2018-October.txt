Steve per your message on Meetup, the below information would be for a
speaking spot for the OWASP Denver group. Please let me know if you have
any additional questions. We look forward to speaking at the Denver OWASP
group.


Abstract:
NowSecure recently performed a groundbreaking benchmark analysis of
hundreds of thousands of public apps found in Apple App Store? and Google
Play?. NowSecure found that 85% of mobile apps have 1 or more vulns that
violate the OWASP Mobile Top 10. From leaking employee/customer data to
interceptable mobile app communications, the threats are real but
identifying and addressing these vulns are difficult.

In this session, Brian Reed, Chief Mobility Officer from NowSecure, will
review the OWASP Mobile Top 10 framework and present this eye popping
benchmark data enumerating threats and risks by OWASP categories and CVSS
scores. Then he will provide sample tools, policies and vetting procedures
to deal with this pandora's box of mobile app risk. Finally he will pull up
the benchmark database live and crowdsource names from the audience to
checkout whether they are safe or sorry!
