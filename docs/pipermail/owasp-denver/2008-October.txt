I remembered a post about clickjacking on a recent DailyDave post. Apologies to those of you who already have this information.

I suggest reading through it and through the references cited in Zalewski's post.

Title: Denver OWASP Meeting: The ASP .NET ESAPI Project
Time: Wed Oct 15 6pm ? 8pm (Timezone: Mountain Time)
Where: Raytheon Polar Services, 7400 S. Tucson Way, Centennial CO 80112
Calendar: owasp-denver at lists.owasp.org
Description: Centralized Security Functionality In a .NET World

The OWASP .NET ESAPI Project The Enterprise Security Application  
Programming Interface, or ESAPI, is a one-stop security shop for developers  
looking to implement security mechanisms in their code. The brainchild of  
Jeff Williams, one of the founders of OWASP, the ESAPI is an open source  
project that has gained traction with organizations looking to implement  
secure applications using tried and tested code that is also well organized  
and consistent. It includes functionality for validating and encoding data,  
authenticating and authorizing users, logging, error handling, and more.  
The API includes a Java reference implementation that can be extended to  
allow any organization to integrate security functionality into their  
Java/JEE applications.

But what about .NET? Many organizations are banking on the powerful  
Microsoft programming framework to help them deliver robust and secure  
software. However, like Java, .NET tends to leave it up to the end-user  
programmers to get security code right. The OWASP .NET ESAPI project  
intends to help .NET developers avoid introducing security vulnerabilities  
into their code by providing a full port of the original ESAPI project from  
Java to C#.

This talk, delivered by the leader of the .NET ESAPI project Alex Smolen,  
will explore the gains, gripes, and gotchas of converting the ESAPI to .NET  
from the .NET ESAPI project lead himself. It will discuss features of  
the .NET frameworks security model, key differences between the Java  
and .NET platforms, and ASP.NET web security issues. Additionally, future  
ideas for .NET specific functionality will be proposed and discussed.  
Participation and feedback from the attendees is expected and encouraged.

More information is at http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denver

Thanks!

David Campbell


NOTE: if Wednesday or Centennial won't work for you, Alex will be  
presenting on Tuesday, 14 Oct in Broomfield. See link below for details:

Folks,

Sorry to cross post this, but both Andy Lewis and I will be involved in
this luncheon event for ISACA, so we figure it's OWASP worthy.

Cheers,

I hope you can attend Denver ISACA's October meeting on Thursday,
October 16.  Check out the details below and on the website:
www.isaca-denver.org.

In today's economy, you cannot beat the value of our training! Please
forward this message to your peers that may be interested.  I look
forward to seeing you there!

Here's the scoop!

Challenges and Successes in Providing Business Benefits: The View from
IT Audit, IT Security, and IT Compliance

We will have a panel to discuss the problems, challenges, and successes
when working to integrate business needs between the Audit, Security,
and Compliance IT functional groups. These groups sometimes seem to work
at cross-purposes, and to some business units, these IT groups are at
odds with day-to-day business objectives. The panelists will present
anecdotes and events to demonstrate challenges and successes in current
and previous positions. We will also have an extended Q&A and will be
soliciting your input. If you have questions or areas you would like
covered, please email the Education VP ahead of time at
education at isaca-denver.org.

Panelists:
Jim Dillon, IT Audit view
Doug Staubach, IT Compliance view
Andy Lewis, IT Security view

Subject: [Owasp-denver] Reminder: Final Denver OWASP Meeting of 2008 is next
 Wednesday, 6pm at Raytheon Polar.  Topic: ASP .NET ESAPI
Message-ID: <48EFA510.1040604@owasp.org>

Folks,

I sent out an invite using gCal the other day and have received a number
of responses.  Thanks to those of you who have RSVP'd.

I understand that our time slot will overlap with the 3rd and final
presidential debate.  We apologize for this oversight, but are unable to
reschedule at this point.  If you are super keen on seeing the debate,
you can catch Alex's presentation the *previous* night, Tuesday, at
Corporate Express in Broomfield.  See
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boulder for more info.

Thanks to Fishnet Security, who have graciously offered to sponsor our
meeting (again).

I look forward to seeing you all next Wednesday, for what I expect will
be one of the BEST presentations we've had all year.  The OWASP ESAPI is
one of our most exciting and useful projects and I am very keen to see
the .NET port evolve.

If you plan to attend and haven't RSVP'd yet please do so using the
calendar invitation.

Full details on the meeting are available (as always) at
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denver

Cheers,

DC
