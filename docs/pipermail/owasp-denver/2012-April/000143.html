April Austin OWASP Chapter Meeting.

When: Tuesday, April 24th, from 11:30 AM -1:00 PM CST

Topic:: Anatomy of Advanced Email Attacks

Email attacks comprise an overwhelming majority of the daily attacks on
modern enterprise. The leading mitigation strategy is a combination of user
awareness training and email filtering. This talk outlines a proposed
solution that brings email risk and awareness information down to the client
level in order to better equip end users in making secure decisions when
using email.

Anti-spam capabilities have been incorporated into email client applications
for some time now. These are usually in the form of junk boxes or email
filters that attempt to identify spam or other unwanted email. Most
anti-spam clients use bayesian filtering to determine whether an email is
spam or not spam, typically using word combinations and statistical analysis
to make a determination. Many experts also advise wary email users to
examine the raw email headers in order to attempt to find evidence of an
email attack. While this is not bad advise, it is however a highly technical
process and one cannot expect the majority of email users to be able to
carry out and act upon this advice. This is the problem that the proposed
Advanced Email Risk Classification and Recipient Decision Assistance
solution attempts to solve. The operating name for this solution is Phish
Finder.
