Subject: [Owasp-denver] AppSec Badge development
Message-ID: <51DF1508.80804@owasp.org>

Hello everyone,

I'm looking to put together a team to design the badges for AppSec USA 
2014. The core idea for the badge is to make it a useful tool that can 
be used outside of the conference yet still be unique and tie into the 
conference.

If you are interested in helping out let me know by next Wednesday July 
17 and we will find a time for the first meeting to solidify the badge 
concept.

Some of the ideas so far:
  - 3D Printing
    + Enigma Machine
    + Fun planetary gears
    + Puzzle boxes
  - Electronic
    + Sensor net
    + Web Server
    + Network Packet Captures
    + Badge to Badge communications
    + Accelerometer/Gyroscope for movement interaction
    + RFID, Infrared communication, or NFC
    + WiFI capable

Members with skills in the following areas would be useful:
  - Electrical Engineering
  - Embedded software
  - CAD design
  - Signal processing
  - Manufacturing
