*<A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP">https://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP">https://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP</A>&gt;*.  Enjoy some great food, drinks and
networking courtesy of Solutions II.  Come network beforehand and after the
presentation (which will start shortly after 6:00)

*TOPIC*:  Secure DevOps


   - DevSecOps is about collaboration. More specifically, it is continual
   collaboration between information security, application development and IT
   operations teams.


   - Having all three teams immersed in all development and deployment
   activities makes it easier for information security teams to integrate
   controls into the deployment pipeline without causing delays or creating
   issues by implementing security controls after systems are already running.


   - Despite the potential benefits, getting started with DevSecOps will
   likely require some cultural changes and considerable planning, especially
   when automating the configuration and security of assets in the cloud,
   whether the model is software-asa-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service
   (PaaS) or infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS).


   - Typical steps for an organization on the path to Agile DevSecOps


   - Observed best DevSecOps practices in some of the most innovative
   organizations
