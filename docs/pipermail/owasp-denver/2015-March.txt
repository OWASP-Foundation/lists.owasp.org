For the DEVELOPER CHALLENGE, we are asking everyone to bring members of
their development team to the free developer training (from 2:00 to
5:00) that will precede the general OWASP meeting (at its normal time of
6:00 to 8:00) .  The company that brings the most developers (to the
training or general meeting)will get a free happy hour (at a later date for
those developers attending) courtesy of Solutions II.

Free Developer Training (2 pm to 5 pm):

Jim Manico will conduct developer focused training.  Students will learn
how to code secure web solutions via defense-based code samples. As part of
this course, we will explore the use of third-party security libraries and
frameworks to speed and standardize secure development. We will highlight
production quality API's from various languages and frameworks that provide
production quality and scalable security controls
