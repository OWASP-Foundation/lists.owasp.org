 21 May 08 @ Raytheon Polar Services: XSS: Exploits and Defenses
Message-ID: <48231DC1.7070302@owasp.org>

The next meeting of the DENVER OWASP chapter will be held at 6pm on 
Wednesday 21 May 2008 at Raytheon Polar Services, 7400 S. Tucson Way, 
Centennial, CO 80112.

Agenda:
6-6:30 Dinner (at RPSC; provided by Fishnet Security.)
6:30 - 6:40 Chapter business
6:40 - 8:00 Interactive Presentation and Q&A

Following the meeting we will have informal discussions over beverages 
at a local pub TBD.

Topic: Intro to Cross Site Scripting, Exploits and Defenses

Speakers:

Chapter leaders David Campbell and Eric Duprey will be presenting on the 
emerging threat of cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

For a long time, the impact of XSS vulnerabilities has been grossly 
underestimated. Recent compromises, such as the pro-Hillary defacement 
of Barack Obama's website demonstrated the impact of XSS vulnerabilities 
to the masses.

During this presentation, we will demonstrate exactly how effective XSS 
vulns can be, and show you what you can do to protect yourself and your 
sites. We intend to make this presentation interactive, so bring a wifi 
equipped laptop and be prepared to join in the fun.

Also note that for those of you that missed Ryan Barnett's fantastic 
April presentation on "virtual patching", you can download the slides at 
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denver_April_2008_meeting.  Big shout 
out to Ryan and the Breach folks for a strong showing in April.


Cheers,
