Subject: [Owasp-denver] HP WebInspect?
Message-ID: <4D77CC46.90303@johnster.com>


OWASPers,

Please forgive a glorified newbie, but I'm looking for someone with 
expertise using HP's "WebInspect" security testing toolkit. Please 
contact me if you do, I've been presented a project that may be interesting.

More generally, I'm interested in asking the group if it knows any web 
application testing suite that might be comparable the above, or simply 
useful? Something FLOSSy would be preferred.

Is anyone familiar with what an AVA scan is?

Thanks in advance for any help / guidance / opinions / flames you might 
provide. :)

Best,

- John

John,

We have it here at work, I use it frequently but I don't know if I would
call myself an expert.  I will try to answer myself or see if anyone on my
team here knows.
