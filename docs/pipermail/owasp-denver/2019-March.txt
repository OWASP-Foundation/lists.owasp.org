My name is Garrett Goggans, a doctoral student at Colorado Technical University. I am in the process of doing a study on the strategies needed by web application developers to adopt the security practices of a secure software development lifecycle.

To conduct this study, I need to interview 10 professionals who have successfully integrated such security practices within a software development lifecycle. I am currently 4 participants short and need to finalize these interviews this weekend or the study will be cancelled.

Understanding the importance of web application security, this correspondence is to invite you to participate in the study offering up the much needed guidance to successful integrate a secure software development lifecycle by answering the following 10 questions:


What is your experience with adopting the security practices of a secure software development lifecycle?


What do you believe the advantages of adopting these security practices to be?


What do you believe the disadvantages of adopting these security practices to be?


What strategies did you have to change to adopt/integrate the security practices successfully?


What strategies were you able to keep in place to adopt/integrate the security practices successfully?


What challenges did you face during the adoption/integration?


What were the non-technological resources needed to successfully do the adoption/integration?


What were the technological resources needed for a successful integration/adoption?


What advice would you give other web application developers who are trying to adopt a secure software development lifecycle?


What other items should be added to our discussion?


The discussion of these questions will last roughly an hour. In addition, each participant must meet the following criteria in order to participate:


Must currently work, or have worked, within an adoption and/or integration of secure software development lifecycle giving them the ability to speak intelligently on the topic.


Must have been upper management or, at a minimum, a senior level professional who had the authority to make integration decisions, or provide input for decisions made, at the time of the integration.


Please note that I can ensure complete confidentiality and anonymity through the guidelines that must be followed by the study. If you are interested in participating in this study, please respond back to me to begin the next steps of the process.

Thank you for your time.

Subject: Invitation to Participate in a Doctoral Study

Hello.

My name is Garrett Goggans, a doctoral student at Colorado Technical University. I am in the process of doing a study on the strategies needed by web application developers to adopt the security models of a secure development lifecycle (SDL). To conduct this study, I need to interview 10 web application developers who have successfully integrated an SDL within their overall development life cycle. This correspondence is to invite you to participate in the study by answering 10 questions revolving around your experience that will last roughly an hour. Each participant must meet the following criteria in order to participate:

? Must currently work, or have worked, with an SDL model giving them the ability to speak intelligently on the topic.
? Must have been upper management or, at a minimum, a senior level professional who had the authority to make integration decisions, or provide input for decisions made, at the time of the integration.

Please note that I can ensure complete confidentiality and anonymity through the guidelines that must be followed by the study. If you are interested in participating in this study, please respond back to me to begin the next steps of the process.

Thank you for your time.
W. Garrett Goggans

Hi 

FYI, the links to join say unknown group name and if I try to search for the
Denver group manually while not logged in to Google, there is no way to join
so your comment about no Google account needed seems to be incorrect.

Thanks
Mitch

A second email with correct links was sent to any email that was caught by
the bug in the automation to send out these notices.

In short, remove the @owasp.org from the links and they work
