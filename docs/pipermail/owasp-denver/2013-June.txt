*Gene Kim* is a multiple award winning CTO, researcher and author. He was

author of ?The Visible Ops Handbook,? and ?The Security Visible Ops
Handbook,?which has sold over 200K copies to date. Gene is also the author
of The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business
Win.

Gene?s area of passion is helping companies build super-tribes where
Development, IT Operations, Product and Project Management and Information
Security simultaneously maximize throughput of features from ?code
complete? to ?in production,? without causing chaos and disruption to the
IT environment. He?s helped some of the largest Internet properties, such
as Microsoft, Yahoo!, AOL and Microsoft companies he?s worked with
Microsoft. He loves finding and fixing bottlenecks which impede and
frustrate the entire organization, enabling management from each tribe to
achieve the greater organizational goals.

*Why We Need DevOps Now*
Gene will present his findings from an ongoing study of how high-performing
IT organizations simultaneously deliver stellar service levels and deliver
fast flow of new features into the production environment. To successfully
deliver against what on the surface appear to be conflicting objectives,
(i.e. preserving service levels while introducing significant amounts of
change into production), requires creating a highly-coordinated collection
of teams where Development, QA, IT Operations, as well as Product
Management and Information Security genuinely work together to solve
business objectives.
Gene will describe what successful transformations look like, and how those
transformations were achieved from a software development and service
operations perspective. He will draw upon fourteen years of research of
high-performing IT organizations, as well as work he's done since 2008 to
help some of the largest Internet companies increase feature flow and
production stability through applications of DevOps principles.

I sincerely hope to see you there!

Subject: [Owasp-denver] Action Requested: Need to vote to determine whether
 AppSec USA 2014 in Denver or Omaha
Message-ID: <CANFTLBy9GyUd-SUWsqHfW+CYiZ2xB0HdTMjtZ=pRsgZAowt6TQ@mail.gmail.com>

Colorado OWASP community,

As some of you know, volunteers from the Boulder and Denver chapters have
been working on growing the SnowFROC brand into a national event. For the
past eight weeks we have worked together with national OWASP executives on
a good faith promise that AppSec USA would be awarded to Denver in 2014. As
OWASP's flagship conference in the US, AppSec USA brings significant
exposure and fundraising revenue which would help both Colorado chapters
grow.


Last Friday the recently-revived Omaha chapter submitted a competing bid.
Because AppSec USA 2014 was never formally awarded to Denver, a vote was
established to determine the host city. Information about both bids was
presented to OWASP leaders. Earlier today it became clear that the vote is
open to the entire OWASP community (and beyond), a point the Omaha
coordinators were quick to leverage. In contrast to the opinions expressed
on leadership mailing lists, Omaha leads the vote.

If you are interested in seeing a national OWASP conference in Denver next
year, I encourage you to make your voice heard. Here are the details about
both proposed locations:
