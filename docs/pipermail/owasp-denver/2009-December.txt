*Topic Summary *
Regardless of our role in the enterprise, we each have a stake in how
the IT contribution is governed.  The better that enterprise IT is
governed and managed, the better we each can do our jobs. And no matter
our primary role...whether that be audit, assurance, compliance, risk,
security, IT or business...we each have a role in improving the overall
governance and management of IT.  During our program, we will talk about
specific ways that we each can, and should, be involved in IT
governance.   And, with the help of panelists, we'll explore specific
ways we each can contribute to dealing with some of the common issues
that organizations encounter when working to implement, improve, and
sustain their IT governance and management work.
