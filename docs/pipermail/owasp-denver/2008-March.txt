Subject: [Owasp-denver] March Meeting Cancelled
Message-ID: <47D842B9.4020900@owasp.org>

All,

Unfortunately our speaker fell through for March so we're going to have 
to cancel the meeting.

We are looking forward to welcoming Ryan Barnett, author of "Preventing 
Web Attacks with Apache" (http://xrl.us/bhkg7) to present at our April 
meeting.

Details forthcoming.

If you are interested in presenting at or sponsoring a future meeting, 
please drop a line.


Cheers!

David Campbell
OWASP Denver
