 From the executive summary:
Malicious activity has become Web-based

In the past, traditional attack activity primarily used widespread, 
broadcast attacks aimed at computers deployed on networks. However, as 
administrators and vendors fortified perimeter defenses with tools
such as firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IP S), 
attackers responded by adopting new tactics. Instead of trying to 
penetrate networks with high-volume broadcast attacks, attackers have
adopted stealthier, more focused techniques that target individual 
computers through the World Wide Web. This may be driven, in part, by 
the fact that compromises that affect computers on enterprise
networks are increasingly likely to be discovered and shut down. On the 
other hand, activity that takes place on end users&#8217; computers and/or Web 
sites is less likely to be detected. As a result of these
considerations, Symantec has observed that the majority of effective 
malicious activity has become Web-based: the Web is now the primary 
conduit for attack activity.


&lt;/quote&gt;

Looking forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming Denver and Boulder 
meetings Wed &amp; Thurs this week.  6pm at RPSC and Corporate Express, 
respectively.
