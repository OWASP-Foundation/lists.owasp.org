<PRE>Please come join us for our January OWASP Denver Meeting.   Enjoy some
great food, drinks and networking courtesy of South Seas, a division of
Solutions II.  Also enjoy a great presentation on Drupal Security by Greg
Foss.

Please RSVP at <A HREF="https://owasp-denver-2014-1.eventbrite.com">https://owasp-denver-2014-1.eventbrite.com</A>

Greg Foss is a Senior Security Research Engineer at LogRhythm Labs, where
he focuses on developing defensive strategies, tools and methodologies to
counteract advanced attack scenarios. His background is in Security
Operations with an emphasis in Penetration Testing and Web Application
Security. Greg holds multiple industry certifications including the OSCP,
GPEN, GWAPT, GCIH, and C|EH, among others.


Drupal is a very popular content management system that has been widely
adopted by government agencies, major businesses, social networks, and
more. Which is why understanding how Drupal works and properly securing
these applications is of the utmost importance. This talk focuses on the
penetration tester's perspective of Drupal and dives into streamlining the
assessment and remediation of commonly observed application and
configuration flaws by way of custom exploit code and security checklists,
all of which will be publicly released following the presentation.
