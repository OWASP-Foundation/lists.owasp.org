*TOPIC*:  Secure DevOps


   - DevSecOps is about collaboration. More specifically, it is continual
   collaboration between information security, application development and IT
   operations teams.


   - Having all three teams immersed in all development and deployment
   activities makes it easier for information security teams to integrate
   controls into the deployment pipeline without causing delays or creating
   issues by implementing security controls after systems are already running.


   - Despite the potential benefits, getting started with DevSecOps will
   likely require some cultural changes and considerable planning, especially
   when automating the configuration and security of assets in the cloud,
   whether the model is software-asa-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service
   (PaaS) or infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS).


   - Typical steps for an organization on the path to Agile DevSecOps


   - Observed best DevSecOps practices in some of the most innovative
   organizations

*TOPIC*:  Secure DevOps

   -

   Cloud computing, hybrid architectures, and agile I.T. delivery are
   critical components of next-generation computing. However, security and
   compliance are significantly disrupted when adopting these strategies, with
   many myths and real challenges to address. This session will focus on the
   challenges and solution approaches them, based on real-world
   implementations within large enterprise environments.
