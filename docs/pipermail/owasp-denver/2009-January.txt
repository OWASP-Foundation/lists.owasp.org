Greetings, and Happy New Year!

On behalf of myself, Andy Lewis and Eric Duprey I'd like to thank you
for you making Colorado OWASP a success in 2008.

We are in the process of setting up the agenda for 2009 and in order to
make the year as exciting and interesting as possible *we need your
input*!  If you can take a few minutes to answer this ten question
survey
<http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=vkPml45P0Xi_2bqNjKh9_2fBUQ_3d_3d>
[1], we would be much obliged!  The survey is anonymous and doesn't
require login/registration/etc.

Also, the first Colorado OWASP meetings of 2009 will be held Wednesday
and Thursday 21 and 22 January, in Denver and Boulder, respectively.

Please save the date.  We are very excited about the hands-on content
that we'll be presenting.  Invitations are forthcoming.  More

Subject: [Owasp-denver] SNOWFROC Call for Presentations
Message-ID: <4970128E.7070107@owasp.org>

On March 5th 2009, OWASP will hold its second ever "Front Range OWASP
Conference (FROC)" in Denver, Colorado.

The Conference consists of a single day of Application Security sessions
with 2 different tracks.

In 2008, we attracted a packed venue with our great AppSec speakers, and
we hope to achieve the same again in 2009. This year we organized the
conference to occur during the peak of the Colorado ski season, so that
speakers can head up to the nearby mountains after the conference to
enjoy some of the legendary snow .

We are seeking presentations on any of the following topics:

   * Web Services and Application Security
   * Common Application related Threats and Risks
   * Business Risks with Application Security
   * "Cloud" Security
   * Vulnerability Research in Application Security
   * Web Application Penetration Testing
   * OWASP Tools and Projects
   * Secure Coding Practices
   * Technology specific presentations on security such as AJAX, XML, etc.
   * Anything else relating to OWASP and Application Security.

The official closing date for receiving a synopsis of the presentation
is 6 February 2009, with announcements on selected candidates to be
provided by 13 February 2009. Complete presentations must be submitted
by 27 February 2009.


Please submit your presentation topics to dcampbell 'at' owasp.org.

The conference page will be updated regularly:

Subject: [Owasp-denver] Thanks for coming out last night. Feedback requested.
Message-ID: <49789DB0.6070402@owasp.org>

Folks,

Thanks to the 30+ members who came for the CTF session.  Apologies for
running out of pizza -- we won't let that happen again.

We are doing the same show tonight in Boulder, and would like to hear
from you *now* about what you think was good, what needed improvement,
etc.  One thing I know we'll switch up for tonight is the pacing/timing
of the challenges, because I want to cover a wider variety of
vulnerabilities than we managed to in Denver.

So please send me a note with your comments and feedback ASAP.

Thanks!!!
