Subject: [Owasp-denver] Suggestions for keynote speakers / volunteers
Message-ID: <CANFTLBxHsFXD-su5U42MnSJsUj7Sj9pwKZKBDp5XoTuwj=oZEQ@mail.gmail.com>

OWASP-Denver,

As you are likely aware, Denver will be hosting the national OWASP
conference (witht the Boulder OWASP Chapter) in Denver in 2014.  We have
the downtown Marriott reserved for the conference and are meeting weekly
planning for this event.  The event will be Sept 16th - 19th, 2014 where
the 16th and 17th are training days and the conference portion will be held
on the 18th and 19th.

We are currently reaching out to engage potential keynote speakers for this
event.  Bruce Schneier (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier) has
already committed to being a keynote and we are looking for other strong
keynotes.  Please email me if you have suggestions (and contacts) with
someone you think would make a strong keynote for this event.

Also, if you are at all interested in volunteering for this event, please
feel free to reach out to me and we can look to get you engaged.

Thank you.

Steve Kosten
OWASP Denver Chapter Leader

Subject: [Owasp-denver] AppSec USA 2014 project volunteers wanted
Message-ID: <CAFSbxeuFo7vAuxWEutQQ2E0LqKq+wx1Sqk_7fk5QuQcV5DFuVw@mail.gmail.com>

As some of you may be aware, the Boulder and Denver OWASP chapters will
host next year's national OWASP conference, AppSec USA 2014. There is much
work surrounding this effort, notably several locally-developed projects.
Due to the amount of work yet to be done, I would like to highlight a few
of these projects in a broad appeal for volunteers.


*Capture the Flag:*
Sunil Kollipara (sunil.kollipara at owasp.org) is managing the development of
a CTF competition. Sunil's team is creating a series of cybersecurity
challenges (e.g., purposely-insecure web applications) for conference
attendees to tackle. If you would like to learn more, please visit the
BOWASP MeetUp event page here:
http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Boulder/events/146262542/
The next CTF meeting will be held on Wednesday, 10/23 at 17th/Pearl in
Boulder. Food and drinks will be provided; please RSVP to ensure we order
the correct amount.

*Conference badges:*
Chris Campbell (chris.campbell at owasp.org) is running the project to design
and manufacture conference badges. He is looking for hardware hackers,
electrical engineers, and especially folks with electronics manufacturing
experience.

*Homebrew competition:*
To showcase one of Colorado's not-so-secret talents, AppSec USA 2014 will
feature a beer brewing competition. This project needs a leader to organize
and manage the project committee, define rules and judging criteria,
solicit participants, design tasters and trophies, coordinate with venue
staff, and oversee the event. Knowledge of beer and/or homebrewing is a big
plus.

*Downtown Denver events:*
To further showcase Colorado, we plan to host evening activities throughout
the conference. Some ideas include group-rate tickets to Red Rocks / Coors
field / the Performing Arts Center, a walking tour of downtown breweries,
or any other fun and memorable event you can come up with. Each activity
needs a champion to define, organize, and execute the event.

*General event volunteers:*
On the day of the conference there will be a variety of tasks, including
manning the registration booth and the merchandise store, stuffing
attending welcome kits, scanning attendee badges, and shuttling speakers
around the city.


Project volunteers may be eligible for various perks (including conference
tickets!). If you want in on the fun, please contact me (
mark.major at owasp.org) or the appropriate project leader.

2014 will be the first year Colorado has hosted AppSec USA. With your help
it won't be the last!
