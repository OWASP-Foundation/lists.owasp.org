Subject: [Owasp-denver] January Meeting and SANS Training
Message-ID: <4D094054.3030104@owasp.org>

Hi all,

Apologies for the dead air lately.  I've been heads down in deep
research mode and Eric's been quietly fighting the good appsec fight for
Fishnet.

At any rate, the wait is over.  We are beginning planning for FROC2011
now (shooting for a Q2 date) piggybacking with SkiSides for maximum
impact and entertainment.

We will be doing a January meeting the last week of Jan up in Boulder in
partnership with SANS.  Details on that to come.

SANS is offering a 10% discount for OWASP members on their upcoming
"Hacker Techniques, Exploits and Incident Handing" class.  Note that you
need to register TODAY to get the lowest tuition as prices go up another
