Message-ID: <1BAAFB74C5643343B75CF51A121690FB0C0A83A7@MER2-EXCHA1.echostar.com>

Don't forget, the April OWASP meeting is tonight at 7:30. Directions can
be found at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denver#Next_Meeting.

Kartik Trivedi, Director of Application Assessment at Accuvant and also
the Southern California OWASP leader will be presenting on Web 2.0
(AJAX, etc).

On the less technical side, Doug Staubach from EchoStar will be
presenting on the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI
DSS). PCI applies to all companies that handle credit card numbers. For
large companies, the PCI standard specifically references OWASP's as a
preferred methodology to secure web-applications.
