2010 Rocky Mountain Information Security Conference
Wednesday, May 05, 2010
7:00 a.m. - 5:30 p.m.
Marriott Denver Tech Center
4900 South Syracuse Street, Denver, Colorado 80237

We are pleased to announce the fourth annual Rocky Mountain Information Security Conference (RMISC).  ISSA and ISACA Denver Chapters have partnered together again to deliver a comprehensive conference addressing information security, IT auditing, compliance and governance. The conference promises a day of education through discussions with industry-leading and local information security, audit, compliance and
IT professionals, as well as thought-provoking breakout sessions on Auditing, Managerial, Technical and Cloud Computing.

Our goal is to provide you with a one-day, low-cost, "no travel required" hiatus from those pressures so you can learn about the latest security trends; interact with industry thought leaders and leading security and auditing vendors; and network with peers to share project successes and war stories.
=========================================================================================================================================================

Thanks,

Ram Ramadoss
Vice President - Education
ISACA Denver Chapter

Topic Summary
Application security is very much about analyzing traffic in both directions, Requests arriving at the web-site and Responses leaving it. Sometimes error messages and diagnostics are being displayed to the public (and malicious users) that reveal critical infrastructure information that then allows the hackers to create targeted, perfectly designed for your environment, attacks. It is very common for attacks to be driven very much from the errors that are leaving your environment. Do you know what your applications are showing the hackers?
