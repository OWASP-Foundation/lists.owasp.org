<PRE>Please come join us for our OWASP Denver meeting.  Enjoy some great food,
drinks and networking courtesy of Solutions II.  Come network beforehand
and after the presentation (which will start shortly after 6:00)

Please RSVP at <A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/225096758/">http://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/225096758/</A>

Looking forward to a great presentation from Merlin  Namuth, Manager of
Security Compliance at Sports Authority on Advanced Incident Response
Techniques.

It is essential for incident responders to expand beyond traditional
incident response activities by digging deeper into alerts. This includes
pivoting off data points and proactively searching for malicious activity
without an alert generated from a security tool. Merlin Namuth will
facilitate learning this advanced approach through helping participants
work through 3 different scenarios.

Merlin Namuth Bio:

In this role he leads a team responsible for incident response,
engineering, architecture, compliance and risk assessments.  Merlin has
over 19 years of IT experience with the last 16 years focused in security.
He has held positions in management, incident response, and engineering.
His experience in security comprises of program and project management,
managing incident response teams, computer forensics, compliance,
architecture and engineering solutions including full packet capture,
advanced malware solutions, DLP, enterprise forensics, firewalls, IDS,
vulnerability scanners, and antivirus.  He holds the PMP, CISSP, GCFA, and
GCIH certifications and is currently pursuing a master&#8217;s degree in finance.
