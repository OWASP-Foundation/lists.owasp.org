Empowering your application to defend itself
>From banks to nonprofits and especially the companies that we work for; It
seems like every organization has a web application for folks to conduct
online banking, enroll a child in daycare or create an account to share a
product review. But how secure are these applications and how do we
establish what ?secure? even is? Enter lessons learned from the iCloud
celebrity hack.


Tonight's discussion will revolve around how to establish defense
mechanisms from the perimeter down to the code base, essentially
weaponizing your web application. We will discuss what attacks look like at
different layers while identifying what types of attacks should be handled
by a device vs by the application. Since the best defense is a good
offense, special attention will be given to integration with existing
security solutions, maintaining the delicate balance between convenience
and security and of course protecting users from themselves.

opportunity to work for various organizations and partner with clients on
all sorts of initiatives, ranging from implementing transparent biometric
user authentication in online banking applications to dumpster diving and
penetration testing. In his current role Serge is primarily responsible for
web application penetration testing and vulnerability research.
