<PRE>The OWASP mail system was down for a while, so I wanted to resend this
in case anyone missed it.

The next meeting of the Denver OWASP chapter will be on Thursday, June
21st at 7:00PM. Accuvant (<A HREF="http://www.accuvant.com/">http://www.accuvant.com/</A>) will be hosting the
meeting at their downtown office. They are located at 621 17th St.
Denver, CO 80293. The map on our chapter website
(<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denver">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denver</A>) has several parking locations
indicated; if you need more detailed directions, please contact David
Byrne. Refreshments will be provided by Symplified
(<A HREF="http://www.symplified.com/">http://www.symplified.com/</A>).

The non/less technical presentation will be by David Stevens from
Symplified. He will discuss methods to calculate Return on Security
Investment (ROSI). Considering how difficult it often is to get funding
for security initiatives, this is a useful skill for any security
professional or security manager.

The technical presentation will be by David Byrne from EchoStar
Satellite. He will speak on Anti-DNS pinning attacks, a technique that
allows an attacker to leverage cross-site-scripting to turn a web
browser into a proxy server. This is done using standard browser
functionality; no client-side vulnerabilities are required. The
end-result is that network firewalls can are completely bypassed to
access internal servers. The presentation will focus on a live
demonstration of an attack.
