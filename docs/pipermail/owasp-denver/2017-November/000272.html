*TOPIC:  How &#8220;Shifting Left&#8221; with Security Can Increase Code Velocity *

Today, Infosec and DevOps operate in silos with different and sometimes
competing mandates. DevOps teams focus on velocity with continuous
iterations while Infosec teams focus on managing risk and control. With the
meteoric rise of microservices architectures enabled by application
containers, the disconnect between DevOps and Infosec puts the organization
at significant risk. Traditional vulnerability and remediation processes
are ineffective in securing containers. Instead, security must be
integrated into the CI/CD toolchain as a critical test to discover
vulnerabilities and enforce enterprise policies before production. This
session will discuss these challenges and suggest techniques,
organizational changes and tools that can help DevOps and Infosec adjust to
these new realities.

*PRESENTER: Bill Olson *

Bill Olson is a technical director at Tenable and helps guide product
strategy and well as helps inform the product management team. Olson works
closely with customers to understand their security needs and to solve
their problems. He is passionate about building better solutions to improve
customers&#8217; security posture and programs.

With over 19 years of experience in the security industry, he is a veteran
and trusted consultant. Before joining Tenable, Olson worked for companies
such as Cyveillance, Square One, and Qualys where he spent nine years
helping organizations create vulnerability and compliance programs. He is
equally at home in marketing and product development, bringing customers
and developers together under the common goal of building and deploying
superior security solutions to meet contemporary business needs.
