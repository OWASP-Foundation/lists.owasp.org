<PRE>OWASP Denver,

I wanted to announce two items in this email.  First is the upcoming
meeting on the 15th of November, details below, please RSVP at: Denver
OWASP Meetup &lt;<A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/244773388/">https://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/244773388/</A>&gt;

&lt;<A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/244773388/">https://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/244773388/</A>&gt;
Second, for those who are OWASP members (paid dues or became members
through our SNOWFROC conference last year), you should have received a
ballot for the OWASP foundation board of directors vote.  You should have
received a link to vote at something like the following:
<A HREF="https://owasp.simplyvoting.com/auth.php?xxyyzz.">https://owasp.simplyvoting.com/auth.php?xxyyzz.</A>  If you can just spend a
couple of minutes and vote, I'd really appreciate your vote.  I feel we
have had a pretty successful chapter and would like to be in a position to
help more with efforts to grow other chapters and improve the OWASP
projects.  So please vote.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please come join us for our OWASP Denver meeting.  Enjoy some great food,
drinks and networking courtesy of Solutions II.  Come network beforehand
and after the presentation (which will start shortly after 6:00)

*TOPIC:*


*How &#8220;Shifting Left&#8221; with Security Can Increase Code Velocity *


Today, Infosec and DevOps operate in silos with different and sometimes
competing mandates. DevOps teams focus on velocity with continuous
iterations while Infosec teams focus on managing risk and control. With the
meteoric rise of microservices architectures enabled by application
containers, the disconnect between DevOps and Infosec puts the organization
at significant risk. Traditional vulnerability and remediation processes
are ineffective in securing containers. Instead, security must be
integrated into the CI/CD toolchain as a critical test to discover
vulnerabilities and enforce enterprise policies before production. This
session will discuss these challenges and suggest techniques,
organizational changes and tools that can help DevOps and Infosec adjust to
these new realities.


*PRESENTER:*  Joe Wilkinson

Joe Wilkinson is a Senior Security Sales Engineer and Solutions Consultant
at Tenable with over 11+ years of hands-on experience engineering and
delivering a wide range of customer solutions. Along with a strong
understanding of how to secure web apps, his areas of security expertise
include Vulnerability Management, APM, SIEM, Change Management, Compliance
(PCI, SOX, HIPPA), DLP, Incident response and Insider Threat analyst and
trainer.
