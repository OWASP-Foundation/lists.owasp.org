Subject: [Owasp-denver] May Meeting Cancellation Notice
Message-ID: <CAJr_1L6n2UZK3ykYxKBvOjHumE10Ss_bug3ONGOMbXqUzp_HyA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello OWASP,

I apologize for the late notice!  We have a speaker coordination problem
and we will not be able to host the May meeting.  This bring up a good
opportunity for you, the member's of this chapter to give feedback on
topics and speakers that you want to hear. If you have heard a great
speaker let someone on the Denver or Boulder board know. We will try to
make it happen.
On a separate note I want give a big shout out our sponsors South Seas and
our host  at Community College of Aurora.


Cheers,
Craig Klosterman
Director of Communication
OWASP Denver

Hello Denver!

I plan on speaking at your July chapter meeting. I'm stoked to have the
chance to return!

Do any of these topics interest you?

Aloha,
Jim

Title: Securing the SDLC
The earlier you address security in the engineering of software, the
less expensive it will be for your organization. This talk will not only
discuss critical security activities necessary to build security
software, but it will also address the unique aspects of secure software
creation specific to the various cloud architectures.

Title: Authentication Best Practices for Developers
This module will discuss the security mechanisms found within an
authentication (AuthN) layer of a web application.  We will review a
series of historical authentication threats. We will also discuss a
variety of authentication design patterns necessary to build a low-risk
high-security web application. Session management threats and best
practices will also be covered. This module will include several
technical demonstrations and code review labs.

Title: Access Control Design Best Practices
Access Control is a necessary security control at almost every layer
within a web application. This talk will discuss several of the key
access control anti-patterns commonly found during website security
audits. These access control anti-patterns include hard-coded security
policies, lack of horizontal access control, and "fail open" access
control mechanisms. In reviewing these and other access control
problems, we will discuss and design a positive access control mechanism
that is data contextual, activity based, configurable, flexible, and
deny-by-default - among other positive design attributes that make up a
robust web-based access-control mechanism.

Title: Cross Site Site Scripting Advanced Defense
This talk will discuss the past methods used for cross-site scripting
(XSS) defense that were only partially effective. Learning from these
lessons, we will also discuss present day defensive methodologies that
are effective, but place an undue burden on the developer. We will then
finish with a discussion of advanced XSS defense methodologies that
shift the burden of XSS defense from the developer to various
frameworks. These include auto-escaping template technologies,
browser-based defenses such as Content Security Policy, and other
Javascript sandboxes such as the Google CAJA project.

Build Application Security Controls into Legal Contracts
Every large organization is building web application software in some
way, normally at great expense. It is a significant organizational and
technical challenge simply to complete complex software projects. It is
and even greater challenge to do so in a secure fashion.The earlier
security is addressed in the engineering of software, the less expensive
it will be for your organization. This talk will discuss several
critical web application security-centric computer programming
techniques necessary to build low-risk web-based applications. This talk
will also describe strategic ways to add prescriptive security control
contract language into software procurement or outsourcing contract
language to encourage even third party developers to build secure code.
