Subject: [Owasp-denver] Lineup announced and registration now open for
	FROC2010
Message-ID: <4BEB2BBE.5050709@owasp.org>

All,

On behalf of the OWASP Foundation I'm pleased to announce that the
lineup for FROC2010 is now live at http://tinyurl.com/froctalks.

Registration is now open at http://froc2010.eventbrite.com/ and due to
the generosity of our sponsors and the dedication of our volunteers,
FROC will again be a free event.  We are accepting donations this year,
as our expenses presently exceed our sponsorships.

Full information is available at http://froc2010.org.


Thanks!

I look forward to seeing you at FROC2010 on the 2nd of June in Denver, CO.

DC

The slides for my talk at FROC 2010 are available for public consumption 
- They may have a few slight revisions throughout the week, but for the 
most part they are final. Feel free to take a look and if you will be 
attending FROC come prepared with questions!

Code samples will also be available within the next week to accompany 
the slides and post-conference, a video and audio stream of the 
presentation will also be available online.

The slides are located here:
