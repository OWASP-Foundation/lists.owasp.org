Subject: [Owasp-denver] OWASP Passfault on Front page of ZDNet!
Message-ID: <CAAcFhdfe=zFONHqUeu2-Uc5GMKSwyGF4dCjRe+fzQyG96KHj9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Two days ago John Fontana of ZDNet called and interviewed me about OWASP
Passfault.  He saw the blog post on owasp that Jim Manico put up for me,
http://owasp.blogspot.com/2012/05/for-better-password-policies-owasp.html

Yesterday he put out a great article explaining the tool and how the
password policy needs to change, not the user:
http://www.zdnet.com/blog/identity/your-passwords-dont-suck-its-your-policies/482

It made it on the front page marquee! Woot!  Other than just a few trolling
comments, the discussion on the article is great.

I owe a huge thank you to John Fontana, Jim Manico, Justin Searle, OWASP
Denver and OWASP Salt Lake, in helping spread the word.

Thanks!


- Cam Morris
