Subject: [Owasp-denver] Colorado OWASP Updates
Message-ID: <4E444D00.1070800@owasp.org>

Greetings all.

I'm pleased to announce that our next meeting will be Wednesday the 14th
of Sept @ Hosting.com featuring local Java ninja Chris Schmidt who will
be speaking on OWASP's flagship defensive project, the Enterprise
Security API.

Details will be on the wiki eventually.  Please follow @owasp303
<http://twitter.com/owasp303> on twitter for quicker updates.

Eric Duprey has recently moved to Las Vegas and as such will no longer
be co-leader of the Denver Chapter.  I'd like to thank Eric for his hard
work and multiple presentations for us over the past few years.  Gerrit
Padgham has volunteered to help run the chapter, but we need more
volunteers.  My goal is to have meetings at least quarterly going
forward.  Please contact me if you're interested in helping out.

OWASP will have a booth at the RMIMA meeting next week, which is focused
on Mobile.  More info here: http://rmima.org/2011/aug2011.htm.


Thanks!  I look forward to seeing you all soon.

DC
