Folks,

As most security folks are headed to Vegas shortly, we've tentatively
scheduled our next chapter meeting for Aug 26 '09.  The wiki and mailing
list will be updated as we firm up the date.

In the meantime, you can also follow us on Twitter (@owasp303), which
will likely be more up to date than the Wiki going forward.

I look forward to seeing all of you soon!

Cheers,
