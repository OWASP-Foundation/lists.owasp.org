Agile is just for development. This statement couldn't be farther from the
truth. Agile methodologies can be used to ensure your security team is
always working on the most important of your never ending assignments. It
can also be used to improve overall quality and efficiency in the delivery
of value for your overworked security team. In this presentation we will
examine how Agile methods can start benefiting your team right away as well
as improving the maturity of your environment long term.

passionate technologist who has applied his expertise across multiple
industries and along the way, began championing the value of strong process
