<PRE>RSVP at <A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/258982751/">https://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/258982751/</A>


Please come join us for our OWASP Denver meeting. Enjoy some great food,
drinks and networking. PLEASE NOTE, WE ARE RETURNING TO CHINOOK TAVERN FOR
THIS MEETING.

For this meeting, we will have our own Matt Shufeldt speaking on Enterprise
Risk Management. Enterprise Risk Management is an incredibly complex and
expansive topic. While other industries have been comfortable limiting
their scope within ERM to areas that logically align, Cyber has struggled
in this pursuit. This discussion will cover setting scope without
minimizing the importance of Cyber to an organization's overall ERM
strategy.

Matt Shufeldt is a leader in the Cybersecurity community and has been
working professionally in technology for over two decades. Matt had been a
CISO and senior IT leader in multiple industries. He's a passionate
technologist who has applied his expertise across multiple industries and
along the way, began championing the value of strong process to support
innovation. But most importantly, Matt loves being an Infosec and Cybersec
geek.
