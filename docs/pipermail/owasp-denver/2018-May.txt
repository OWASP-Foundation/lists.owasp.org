Subject: [Owasp-denver] OWASP Presenting at Industry Infosec Event at RMISC
Message-ID: <CANFTLBxkMYW+rWhYUVtHwYeuJWZf=4NcF63xqR4fE3jEA0BbRQ@mail.gmail.com>

RMISC is taking place next week and we were asked to take part in their
industry event on Tuesday May 8th. There will be presentations from other
information security groups, a job fair, and networking. So basically and
OWASP event w/ a few more groups tied in (ISSA, ISACA, InfraGuard, CSA,
etc).

THIS DOES NOT REPLACE OUR PLANNED OWASP MEETING WHICH WILL STILL TAKE PLACE
ON MAY 16th.

But plan on coming and enjoy. No cost. Read more about it at

Subject: [Owasp-denver] Join us for May's OWASP Meeting
Message-ID: <CANFTLBw1F6X+cm6B0i9t0T+b2rd1cpNfpLnroLwpE4VWoZSNMQ@mail.gmail.com>

RSVP at https://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/events/250619187/

Please come join us for our OWASP Denver meeting. Enjoy some great food,
drinks and networking courtesy of Solutions II. Come network beforehand and
after the presentation (which will start shortly after 6:00)

*TOPIC: Cloud tools for AppSec*

This talk will center on the use of cloud based tools for Application
Security. The goal is to show how these tools can augment an existing
AppSec program or be used to stand up a new program. Further discussion
will bring out the integration of vulnerability scanning into DevOps. Last,
we'll focus on the role people take, specifically how the developer needs
to be involved earlier in the SDLC and own secure coding.

*PRESENTER: John Dombroski*

John Dombroski is a Federal Security System Engineer with IBM, based in
Greenville, SC. He specializes in Application Security with a specific
focus on tools that assist static and dynamic scanning of applications.
Finding and fixing vulnerabilities early in the Software Development Life
Cycle (SDLC) reduces cost and allows the enterprise to be secure by design.
John believes that people lead technology, not the other way around.
