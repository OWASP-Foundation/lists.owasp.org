      Topic: Security in the Clouds

Synopsis: This talk provides a brief overview of cloud computing, and
reveals the security risks of moving into the clouds. The concept behind
cloud computing is simple: use a hosting provider&#8217;s IT resources to
expand or shrink to meet your needs, and only for pay what you need when
you need it. This architecture appeals to many IT managers as it reduces
the initial startup costs, maintenance costs, and overhead required to
run systems. Got slashdotted? Not a problem. Your cloud presence will
seamlessly expand to push your business to the next level. However, as
with all new technology, there are inherent risks. We will discuss the
security risks with application code, architecture, the runtime
environment, and the development environment.

Presenter: *Jon Rose*
