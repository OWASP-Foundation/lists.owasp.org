Subject: [Owasp-denver] January OWASP-Denver Meeting
Message-ID: <28a977e00612172130k6340cbccse28ffe6db0b1648@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, and thank you all for joining the OWASP Denver mailing list. The next
meeting will be on January 17, 6:30PM at EchoStar Satellite's headquarters
south of the DTC. The classroom we are meeting in can easily hold 50 people;
far more if we crowd in. This should make for more breathing room than last
month. If you think you may attend, please RSVP to
david.byrne at echostar.comwith your name and company. Directions can be
found
here<http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=e.+lincoln+ave+Englewood,+co+80112+to+9601+S.+Meridian+Blvd+Englewood,+co+80112&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=46.36116,82.265625&ie=UTF8&z=15&om=1>.
Come to the main entrance and tell the security guard you are with the OWASP
meeting. If you get lost, call David Byrne at (desk) 720-514-5675 or (cell)
303-912-2612.

Michael Walter will be giving a presentation on security in the SDLC. We
also need an additional technical presentation lasting 30-45 minutes. Please
let me know if you are interested in presenting.

Finally, if there are any vendors out there interested in providing food and
drink based sponsorship, contact me.

Thanks,
David Byrne
