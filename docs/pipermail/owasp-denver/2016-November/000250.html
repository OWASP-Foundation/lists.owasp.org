*Course: Hacking the OWASP Top 10 (by Aaron Cure)*

Learn to identify the OWASP Top 10/CWE 25 vulnerabilities, and how to
exploit them. Students will be introduced to the vulnerabilities, see
demo's and run exploits live in a VM environment. Mitigation strategies
will be discussed in a programing language agnostic format, and no
programming experience is required.

*Class: ZAP Your Web APP (by Serge Borso) *
*- Getting the most out of the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) for the
security professional*
This class will focus on using ZAP to assess a web application in a
real-world environment. There will be six hands-on labs aimed at exploring
the rich features of the tool with the goal of discovering flaws in a web
application and exploiting them in a meaningful way. Labs include account
enumeration and brute forcing, SQL Injection, XSS, XSRF and command
injection all with bonus material to drive home the concepts and for
mastery of the tool.
