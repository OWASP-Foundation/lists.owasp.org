We will hear Dan Cornell present on Securing Mobile Application with Threat
Modeling and Secure Design

*Mobile applications often present security challenges that can be more
complicated than those of traditional web applications. This presentation
looks at how development teams and security teams can work together to
proactively build more secure mobile apps. The discussion looks at both how
threat modeling can be used by security teams to identify application
weaknesses as well as how development teams can use threat modeling to
identify potential issues so as to plan countermeasures. Recommendations on
prioritizing various testing and assurance activities are provided so that
mobile app development teams can make informed decisions on how to best
allocate scarce resources when crafting their mobile application assurance
programs.*
