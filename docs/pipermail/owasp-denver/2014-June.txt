*Presentation:*

Static vulnerability analysis is the practice of testing non-running
software for application vulnerabilities. It is often referred to as SAST,
white box testing, or automated code review. In this session we will cover
some of the hows and whys of static analysis and deep dive some of the
common issues users of SAST technologies often encounter. Topics will
include data flow analysis and taint propagation, scan noise, and partial
code scanning, specifically around OWASP Top 10 issues. The material should
provide value to anyone with an interest in application security, not just
static analysis practitioners.
