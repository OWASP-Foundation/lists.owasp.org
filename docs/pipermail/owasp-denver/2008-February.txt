I'd like to thank David & Eric Duprey for working to get things underway again. Andy Lewis left to start the the Boulder chapter, and, as you probably guessed, I've been unable to do much with OWASP lately. Fortunately, David & Eric have volunteered to take over. I still plan to be at the meetings, and I hope to see you all there; it sounds like a great presentation.

Thanks,
David Byrne

All,

Thanks for a great turnout last night.  I was well impressed with
Michael's presentation, particularly the (Fuggle) implications for
application level worms that could target not just known vulns in canned
software, but also flaws in bespoke applications as well.  Bravo!

Thanks to HP for providing us with the food & drink, and also to Raytheon
Polar for an exciting new venue for us.

For those of you that attended, I am quite keen to get feedback on the
event.  Please email myself and <a href="mailto:eduprey at gmail.com"> Eric
Duprey</a> with comments and suggestions.

One bit of administrivia: the Raytheon physical security folks are telling
me that visitor badge #52, issued to "Chris Roberts" was not returned. 
Chris, I couldn't find you on the subscriber list, but if you get this
email please contact me off-list ASAP as the Raytheon folks are keen to
get this badge back ASAP.


Thanks again all, and I look forward to seeing you at our next meeting. 
More info on that to follow shortly!

Cheers,

- DC
