Subject: [Owasp-denver] Next Meeting Scheduled for Thursday,
 27 Aug 09 at RPSC: "Security in the Clouds" featuring Jon Rose
Message-ID: <4A79CE78.5090509@owasp.org>


      Topic: Security in the Clouds

Synopsis: This talk provides a brief overview of cloud computing, and
reveals the security risks of moving into the clouds. The concept behind
cloud computing is simple: use a hosting provider?s IT resources to
expand or shrink to meet your needs, and only for pay what you need when
you need it. This architecture appeals to many IT managers as it reduces
the initial startup costs, maintenance costs, and overhead required to
run systems. Got slashdotted? Not a problem. Your cloud presence will
seamlessly expand to push your business to the next level. However, as
with all new technology, there are inherent risks. We will discuss the
security risks with application code, architecture, the runtime
environment, and the development environment.

Hey Denver Owasp,

I wanted to thank everyone who came out last Thursday for my cloud  
security talk, especially David and Eric for setting everything up.   
It was great to meet everyone and get the opportunity to discuss the  
various security issues related to cloud computing.   With so many  
different companies providing different forms of "Clouds", it  
definitely presents challenges for security.  I really appreciated all  
the feedback and comments and am updating my presentation to  
incorporate your input.  If you have any thoughts, let me know.  Also,  
shoot me an email if you plan to make it to DC for the DCAppSec, it  
should be fun.

Take care,
Jon
