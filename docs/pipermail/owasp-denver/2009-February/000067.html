<PRE>Greetings all,

Thanks to all of you that came out to support OWASP during the January
chapter meetings.

As mentioned previously, Denver will not be having a February chapter
meeting, as the chapter leaders have been spending all their time
preparing for SnowFROC!  Boulder is planning a February meeting but the
details are not finalized yet.

So, now, more about SnowFROC!  The responses to the CFP were
overwhelming, and we are very excited to be presenting a full day *FREE*
security conference in downtown Denver, CO on 5 March 2009.

Please see the conference website at <A HREF="http://snowfroc.com">http://snowfroc.com</A> for all the
details and to register.  Registration is *FREE* but mandatory to ensure
we don't oversubscribe venue capacity.

Thanks and I look forward to seeing you all there!
