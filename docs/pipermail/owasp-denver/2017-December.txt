Denver OWASP,

I wanted to reach out quickly to everyone and encourage anyone who knows
someone they'd love to hear at our SNOWFROC conference or who thinks they
have a great topic for presentation, to reach out (to contact or submit
yourself) to our call for papers site.  (https://snowfroc.com/#cfp)

On another note, we mentioned at our last meeting podcast run by Robb Reck
and Alex Wood (https://www.colorado-security.com/).  They have also invited
all of our members to join a slack channel they crated. It?s meant to be an
open community, and gives us change to help folks meet one another.  Please
check it out.
