Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] August 21st Meeting
Message-ID: <9080b2fcc858fb01e6316ff5ce588673@consoltec.net>

August 21st is my son's third birthday. As such I will not be at the 
meeting scheduled for that evening. The meeting can still take place 
with out me if there is enough interest. I can make sure the doors are 
open, order pizza and drinks, etc. There is no speaker scheduled at the 
moment, but I will take care of that as well if there is interest in 
having a meeting. On the other hand you could just enjoy the night off. 
:-). Rather than replying to this email please visit 
http://www.meetup.com/owaspCLT/polls/604022/ to cast your vote. I know 
it's easy to skip over such things during our busy days, but I'd prefer 
to hear from you rather than assume your silence means you're not 
interested. It'll take two seconds. Thanks.

This is just a reminder that there will be no OWASP Charlotte meeting 
this month. If you've already RSVP'd I appreciate it but please don't 
show up. You'll be the only one there. I'm going to try to figure out 
how to cancel a meeting inside meetup.com. See you next month.
