<PRE>I've been giving this a bit more of a think. Our bee club has a board of
9 members in addition to the active board. The full board looks like:

President
Vice-President
Secretary
Treasurer

Then there is a 5 member board around that known as the executive board.

1 seat is filled by the past president and he remains until the current
president becomes the past president.

The program chair, who is responsible for finding the speakers and
arranging a meeting place. Though we have a regular meeting place nailed
down. They serve until they no longer wish to.

Then there are 3 seats that serve for 3 years and the positions are
staggered such that one seat becomes open each year. These are elected
positions.

I don't think this club is of the size that it requires such management,
but it's something to keep in the back of your minds. Maybe something to
revisit down the road.

However, the one position I'd like to duplicate and add to the list is
that of past president. I see the professional representative equivalent
to that of the program chair with a bit more functionality. 

Also, somethings worth considering and we should decide on at the next
meeting is:

- Are they voted or appointed positions?
- Do these board seats have term limits?

Personally I'm not in favor of term limits as it is hard enough finding
people willing to work, and secondly a term limit could force someone
that's doing a really good job to step down and possibly put someone in
place that has no real interest in serving just to fulfil term limit
requirements. But I think it's something we should decide as a group.

As a side note does anyone have someone in mind as a speaker for this
month?

</I>&gt;<i> From: Jay Reynolds &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-charlotte">reynolds.jay at gmail.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Board Member Selection
</I>&gt;<i> To: OWASP Charlotte &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-charlotte">owasp-charlotte at lists.owasp.org</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After thinking about the nomination/selection of seven chapter board
</I>&gt;<i> members last night (about half of the meeting's attendees), I suggest
</I>&gt;<i> that we reduce the number of board members to a reasonable amount
</I>&gt;<i> given the relatively small size of our membership. We should define
</I>&gt;<i> some board member roles and responsibilities that will best suit our
</I>&gt;<i> chapter, and select one board member best suited for each role. As the
</I>&gt;<i> chapter's membership and involvement grows, we can add more board
</I>&gt;<i> members to these or other roles not yet defined. For now, we should
</I>&gt;<i> select from chapter members who feel that they meet one the role
</I>&gt;<i> requirements. John Melton and I have come up with the following roles
</I>&gt;<i> that we feel would most benefit the chapter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Roles
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Chapter Leader - Jon Molesa. Everybody's happy with this choice and
</I>&gt;<i> we're confident that Jon will do a fine job.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Treasurer - This dedicated treasurer would manage the chapter's
</I>&gt;<i> finances. The treasurer must be trustworthy (loaded statement) and
</I>&gt;<i> should have no professional relationships with any other board members
</I>&gt;<i> to avoid conflict of interest. The treasurer does not need security
</I>&gt;<i> expertise or industry contacts. The treasurer must be able to manage
</I>&gt;<i> budgets and spend wisely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> University Representative - This person should represent the
</I>&gt;<i> university and act as a local liaison between the chapter's
</I>&gt;<i> professionals and students, as well as between the chapter and the
</I>&gt;<i> university. The OWASP Charlotte chapter has a strong student
</I>&gt;<i> contingent and we've greatly benefitted from a relationship with the
</I>&gt;<i> UNCC College of Computing and Informatics. This board seat is vital to
</I>&gt;<i> the chapter. I believe that Dr. Chu is the only logical choice for
</I>&gt;<i> this seat.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Professional Representative - This person should have solid expertise
</I>&gt;<i> and contacts within the Information Security industry. This person
</I>&gt;<i> should also have experience running or participating in OWASP chapters
</I>&gt;<i> or functions. This person will serve in the interest of OWASP
</I>&gt;<i> Charlotte. It is critical that OWASP Charlotte be free of corporate
</I>&gt;<i> control or influence.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Possible Role
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Junior/Student Board Member - This person would be a UNCC student and
</I>&gt;<i> represent peer students, organize student events, and work with other
</I>&gt;<i> board members to provide chapter mentorship or other opportunities for
</I>&gt;<i> students.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anybody interested in being considered for these roles should submit
</I>&gt;<i> their names. We can make the final board selection the first order of
</I>&gt;<i> business during our next meeting, or we can vote via email, doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> matter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I'd like to remove my name from consideration for these board
</I>&gt;<i> member roles. I have no interest in being the treasurer, I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> affiliated with the university, and I simply don't have the industry
</I>&gt;<i> contacts that will benefit the chapter. I have strong technological
</I>&gt;<i> and information security expertise that I will contribute to the
</I>&gt;<i> chapter as a standard member.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Jay Reynolds
