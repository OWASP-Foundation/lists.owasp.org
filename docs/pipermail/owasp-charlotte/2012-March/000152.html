<PRE>I can do next Tue Night 8-9pm - looks like this could be a lot of fun!

&gt;<i> I would like for starters to begin working on a PHP data validation

</I>&gt;<i> less overhead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What *I* would LIKE to see in such a framework is:
</I>&gt;<i> * Something familiar to PHP programmers - i.e., let's not write a Java
</I>&gt;<i> validation framework in PHP, but lets do things the way PHP people are
</I>&gt;<i> accustomed to.
</I>&gt;<i> * Something deliberate - as a security practitioner, I've never seen a
</I>&gt;<i> good validation framework where validation is done transparently and
</I>&gt;<i> automatically - this almost universally means &quot;make sure we don't
</I>&gt;<i> allow bad data&quot;, but nobody knows what all bad data will look like.
</I>&gt;<i> You have to choose to use (or not use) this. And you have to choose
</I>&gt;<i> the right validators to use.
</I>&gt;<i> * Something consistent - whatever pattern we choose to use to
</I>&gt;<i> implement this should be consistent regardless of the type of data
</I>&gt;<i> you're producing, and errors should be handled consistently across the
</I>&gt;<i> board. We can't return NULL for some functions and throw exceptions
</I>&gt;<i> for others or raise E_ERROR for yet others
</I>&gt;<i> * Something imperative - this one I'm flexible on. But lots of apps
</I>&gt;<i> try to make things declarative, so in addition to learning the
</I>&gt;<i> language and framework, you have to learn a new XML schema or a new
</I>&gt;<i> YAML schema or a new DSL. PHP isn't compiled, so calling validation
</I>&gt;<i> routines explicitly and imperatively is not much more difficult than
</I>&gt;<i> writing an XML file. As I said, I'm more flexible on this one.
</I>&gt;<i> * Something that's a joy to use - at least for PHP programmers.
</I>&gt;<i> Whatever we make should be fun enough to use that you want to do it
</I>&gt;<i> some more. JSR-303 is kinda' like this. I did something that looked
</I>&gt;<i> like rocket science, but it wasn't really that hard, but it makes
</I>&gt;<i> writing the code so much more fun.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For this code jam, I need a few people (no more than 5). A good mix
</I>&gt;<i> will be people will include
</I>&gt;<i> * people who use PHP for a living and can really answer the first two
</I>&gt;<i> items and the last. What frameworks have you used in the past that
</I>&gt;<i> remind you how great it is to be a PHP programmer? What design
</I>&gt;<i> patterns did they use that make you happy? How can we apply that to a
</I>&gt;<i> new library/framework? (I started something using magic methods, but
</I>&gt;<i> I'm certain it's not how PHP programmers are accustomed to working).
</I>&gt;<i> * a scribe. Initially we're going to be planning a framework and not
</I>&gt;<i> just jump in writing code. We need somebody who can document the
</I>&gt;<i> requirements really well
</I>&gt;<i> * coders - if you've got a little PHP experience or a lot is fine -
</I>&gt;<i> once we determine the design pattern, the rest should mostly fall into
</I>&gt;<i> place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can either use a Google+ Hangout or GoToMeeting to do this. If we
</I>&gt;<i> use GoToMeeting, I need a bit of advance notice to get it all set up
</I>&gt;<i> through OWASP. I've used Google+ Hangouts in the past and they work
</I>&gt;<i> really well for this sort of thing as we can edit documents
</I>&gt;<i> collaboratively (as in multiple people typing simultaneously) screen
</I>&gt;<i> share an editor, have video and voice chat, etc. I think the first
</I>&gt;<i> session of this we should probably plan on an hour for starters, then
</I>&gt;<i> see if there's a division of labor that reveals itself from that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tuesdays and Thursdays work best for me, although I'm teaching next Thursday.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anybody available next Tuesday night - maybe 8pm-9pm?
</I>&gt;<i>
