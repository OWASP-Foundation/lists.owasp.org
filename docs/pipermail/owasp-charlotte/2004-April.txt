Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Treasurer's Report
Message-ID: <7BC37D89-007D-492C-8414-9C55DD9E6506@thestranathans.com>

Okay, we don't have a treasurer, but I thought to be transparent to the chapter it was important to at least share where we stand.

The financial report I'm given says that we had an opening balance of $0 left over from 2010.
To date in 2011, the chapter has received $40 (probably from the optional percentage of OWASP Membership fees being targeted to our chapter)
We've had no expenses against this balance.
This leaves us with a current balance of $40.

If you have become an OWASP Member (this is NOT required to participate in the Charlotte OWASP chapter) and had your optional percentage directed to the Charlotte chapter in 2010, please let me know.  It seems that because our chapter was inactive at the time, that some of our fees did not go there.  I'm guessing that we waited long enough now that those are "lost" but I will still contact the board and see if those can be recovered.

I think before the UNCC Cyber Security Symposium, I would like to have SOMETHING for our table that says OWASP, but the tablecloth is out of our budget currently. The tablecloth and banners are in the "Items to Borrow or Purchase" section, so I will fill out the merchandise request form and see if there's a possibility for us to borrow those for the Symposium until we get enough in the kitty to be able to fund some of those things on our own.

Will
