<PRE>We have confirmed a date and time.  Our next meeting will be
Wednesday, January 26 at 6pm, somewhere at UNC Charlotte.  We should
have a specific room soon.  UNC Charlotte has been gracious enough to
host us.  You'll need to bring $6 (I believe) for parking, unless you
have a UNCC parking pass.  I'll send the room information as soon as I
have it.  We'll talk about potential OWASP projects for us to adopt.
See <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project</A> to see if
there are any projects that interest you, or bring ideas for new
projects to work on.  Bill Chu, Department Chair of the College of
Computing and Informatics will be presenting ASIDE, an IDE plugin for
assisting developers in writing defensive code from the beginning.

Also, thanks to Brent Harrington, we have an official OWASP Charlotte
logo!  He's also spent a lot of time putting together a Power Point
template that is distinctly OWASP Charlotte.  You can see a lot of the
new &quot;branding&quot; on the Twitter site at
<A HREF="http://twitter.com/OWASPCharlotte.">http://twitter.com/OWASPCharlotte.</A>  We'll post news there, as well, so
give it a follow.

And in other news, Mark Cimijotti has put together a straw-man
presentation for doing an &quot;elevator pitch&quot; for OWASP Charlotte with
other local professional or user groups that might have some interest
in OWASP Charlotte.

Thanks to Brent and Mark for giving us an image and presentation materials!

Finally, if you haven't introduced yourself to the list, let us all
know who you are, what you do, and what you hope to get out of OWASP
Charlotte.

Regards,
Will
