Since the chapter is getting back together after a long-ish hiatus, it's probably a good idea for those on the mailing list to briefly introduce themselves.  Nothing terribly intimidating.  Maybe:

Your name
What you do relative to Web Application Security
What you hope to get out of the local chapter

I'll get us started....

I'm Will Stranathan.  I used to be an application pen tester, but more recently do security code review of applications and help with many facets of web application security (some pen test subject help, architecture review, help developers make static analysis part of their SDLC, training, etc.).  My only qualification, really, is that I've been writing rotten code since the days of the Commodore 64.  Out of the local chapter, I hope to develop some more professional relationships with local experts, and hope to get to work on some exciting projects with OWASP.

Now it's your turn.

Will,
Thanks for heading this up.  Here's my info.

Your name: John Melton
What you do relative to Web Application Security: Secure code/architecture
review on web apps, teach part-time at uncc, lead dev for OWASP AppSensor,
committer on OWASP ESAPI
What you hope to get out of the local chapter: meet smart people, learn new
things about web app security, give back to the OWASP community

Thanks,
John

My name is Bill Chu and I am a faculty member at UNC Charlotte. My research interest is in software security / assurance. One of my current research project is ASIDE plug-in (Assured Software IDE plug-in) for Eclipse. We just submitted a proposal to OWASP to make it an open source project. We also launched the first OWASP student chapter and I am very interested injecting software security issues through out the computing curriculum at UNC Charlotte and beyond.

What you do relative to Web Application Security:
As of last week, I have moved from the Network side of the fence to the
Application Security side.  Kind of a strange move, but I hope it works out
for both myself and my company.

What you hope to get out of the local chapter:
I hope to help in anyway I can and along the way learn what others are doing
in the field.

Hi,

I'm Owen Henty. I'm currently a web applications developer for Atkins 
Library at UNCC. Currently I'm tasked with developing open source 
applications with Java and PHP. I have worked mostly as a developer but 
have been a QA lead on a development team. I like to try and write 
secure code and assist others in doing so.
I hope to learn from the group and contribute to projects.


Owen.

Hi, everyone.

Thanks for getting this initiated, Will!

My name is Ken Robey and I am an IT leader and consultant 
specializing in information security and IT risk.  While I have a lot 
of application experience, my most recent experience has been with 
policy, process, and the infrastructure side.  I hope to learn more 
about the current state of web applications and related security 
concerns and to contribute from my background wherever possible.

It's actually not unusual at all (from what I've seen) to move from network security to application security.  Application security as its own discipline is new enough (again, from what I've seen) that there aren't a lot of people looking for jobs in it that have been trained in the ways of appsec - so usually you see network security folks learn the application side, or you see application developers learn the security side.  I think the former is more common than the latter - again, just my experience.

But welcome aboard!  You're certainly not alone with the experience you bring.

Will

Welcome, John.  Incidentally - great presentation on AppSensor at the UNC-Charlotte Cyber Security Symposium.  Do you carry that presentation around in your back pocket?  It might be handy for us to see at the first/second official re-meeting.

the Commodore 64.? Out of the local chapter, I hope to develop some more 
professional relationships with local experts, and hope to get to work on some 
exciting projects with OWASP.

Now it's your turn.

Will,
Thanks very much.  I'd be glad to do that presentation again whenever you'd
like.  I somewhat hurriedly put it together for the symposium since I wasn't
a planned speaker until a few days before the event :).  I could also show
some more detailed technical info (and code) since I might have a few more
minutes and we can delve into the technical.
Thanks,
John

That is good to hear.  I was a bit concerned, but I do feel I will enjoy the
new challenges the position will bring.

Hey guys,

My name is Nick Gadish.  I received my undergrad in MIS from UNCC (so I am excited about our meetings @ UNCC), and my graduate degree from Gardner Webb.  I have worked in application security testing in various aspects and roles for the past 5 years. Even after several years in the industry, I still get excited every time I get a XSS script to pop......yes....that is a bit nerdy.  I currently do ethical hacking (pen testing) on web applications for a financial firm.   I am looking forward to doing some R&D as well as some innovative open source projects with this team.

Kind Regards,
Nick

Hey everyone,how you doing?

My name is Jake Lee and I had been involved with overall penetration testing
world since mid 90's. I've started off on x86 assembly in MS & IBM-DOS days
and migrated and tinkered in C/C++ development during college and subsequent
years afterwards.
I've somehow migrated over to web app side since '04 and had managed the
assessment team for a large company that was bought out by another few years
back.  My qualification is that I'm better at breaking things than putting
things together. Glad to join this chapter.

Your name:  Charles Boling

What you do relative to Web Application Security?

Develop methods to violate app/os/web security.  Then use those
methods to evaluate systems and networks.

What you hope to get out of the local chapter?

Maintain awareness of current and emerging defense methods to guide
research and testing.  Unfortunately, I am now located at Ft. Gordon
so meeting attendance will be rare, but recognized a number of
individuals and wanted to remain a resource.

I'm the main web developer and a Windows developer at PCI Group, a company
that prints/mails collection letters. I graduated with CIS in 2007 from
Lenoir-Rhyne College. I use ASP.NET, VB.NET, SQL Server, SSRS. Our
client-only site features installable Microsoft web certificates (I hate
them!), MD5-hashed passwords, and security questions for forgetting
passwords. Not sure what to expect from Owasp...not sure what it really is.
Been on the list for a while, and usually delete them..lol.

Hopes: I hope the resurrection of the chapter goes well.  Wasn't much interest the first go around, maybe the industry hadn't caught up with us then... of course *that* was seven years ago... about 8 years ago flee and i had talked about doing an aspect oriented security library... have been thinking of picking that back up, dusting off the code (if i can find it) and seeing where it goes.

Hi everybody--

My name is Mike Parsons.  I've been in Information Security for over 15
years and in Information Technology over 30 years.  I actually put the first
firewall in at Wachovia (the original one) and was the security engineer
responsible for implementation of Wachovia's first on-line banking and
on-line brokerage products.

I took a number of courses toward my PhD in Information Security and Privacy
in the 2001-2005 timeframe at UNC Charlotte but was pressured to drop out by
my employer at the time.  I did complete requirements for a graduate
certificate in Information Security and Privacy to complement an MBA I
earned some time ago from the University of Maryland.

I was reintroduced to modern web application security during a stint at
Breach Security where I was the channel systems engineer for their WebDefend
product and still do a little work with the product.

I just took a position leading the information security effort at a
community bank north of Charlotte and want to keep abreast of developments
in the web security space.  I look forward to participating in the efforts
of the Charlotte Chapter of OWASP.

I also maintain an active membership in Infragard, ISSA and ISACA and have
presented at several local events.

Kindest regards.

Since the chapter is getting back together after a long-ish hiatus, it's
probably a good idea for those on the mailing list to briefly introduce
themselves.  Nothing terribly intimidating.  Maybe:

I'll get us started....

I'm Will Stranathan.  I used to be an application pen tester, but more
recently do security code review of applications and help with many facets

I am K.C. Yerrid; my friends call me K.C..  I like long walks on the beach
but find sandy toenails quite disturbing.  If you find this to be quite
metaphoric, then you would possibly be correct.  I am a consumer and
advocate of the W3AF and can bang out Hello World! in many different
languages, but not much more than that.  I do have a kung-fu grip on
spotting rotten code and conceptually thinking like a ninja.  When I am not
learning, I am sleeping.

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Introduce Yourself

Since the chapter is getting back together after a long-ish hiatus, it's
probably a good idea for those on the mailing list to briefly introduce
themselves.  Nothing terribly intimidating.  Maybe:

Your name
What you do relative to Web Application Security What you hope to get out of
the local chapter

I'll get us started....

I'm Will Stranathan.  I used to be an application pen tester, but more
recently do security code review of applications and help with many facets
of web application security (some pen test subject help, architecture
review, help developers make static analysis part of their SDLC, training,
etc.).  My only qualification, really, is that I've been writing rotten code
since the days of the Commodore 64.  Out of the local chapter, I hope to
develop some more professional relationships with local experts, and hope to
get to work on some exciting projects with OWASP.

Now it's your turn.

Hi.  My name is Larry Crump and I am a System Architect at Duke Energy.   I work with online billing and payment applications and other miscellaneous internal customer service applications.  I am responsible for the architecture and design of our systems in the customer service domain, with emphasis on ensuring adherence to standards and integration with both internal and external applications.  In addition to those responsibilities, I am also the representative for our division to our company-wide team that reviews security strategy, architectures and standards across the enterprise.

I would like to be able to interact with other security professionals in the Charlotte area to get ideas for best practices that we can work into our Solution Delivery Lifecycle, so we can get more developers to focus on security issues up front when applications are being developed.
