Hello people, 
I just signed up to this list and I wondered what we really talk about. Just a 
little background about me, I live in Charlotte, I mainly code in PHP and C, and 
I use Linux.


As I said this post was just a "What's Up" kinda thing

Thanks,
Foxwolfblood

Joshua:

Welcome aboard!  Things are a little slow for the holidays right now,
but we're planning on having our next meeting in late January or early
February.  We also have a couple of folks working on an elevator pitch
so we can talk up the group with other local groups to get some
additional interest.

What we talk about on the list lately, since we're just getting
restarted, is what we hope to accomplish as a group.  We've talked
about a couple of existing OWASP projects we might try to get involved
with, and I suspect that making a couple of decisions on that will be
a large part of what we spend the next meeting on.  A couple of folks
in the group are already involved in a couple of different OWASP
projects, so those might be "natural" selections, but that doesn't
prevent us from picking something else entirely.

So, once again - welcome.  Look forward to meeting.
