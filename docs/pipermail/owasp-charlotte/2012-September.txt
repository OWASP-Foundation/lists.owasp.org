I am very happy to announce today that Trustwave SpiderLabs and its
partner has made available a FREE online CBT on the OWASP Top 10 that
does *not* required a sign-up.

View it online
at: https://www.trustwave.com/sae_sample/owasp-top-10/Start.htm to check
it out.

As a global community that has a unified mission to raise visibility for
application security, anytime a free resource is made available it is a
positive advancement just as we have done with the AppSec Tutorial
series https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Appsec_Tutorial_Series  so
that individuals and organizations worldwide can make informed decisions
about true software security risks

Time to make some popcorn!

Enjoy!

*Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] August 21st Meeting*

*Date: *August 3, 2012 8:49:20 AM EDT

*To: *OWASP Charlotte <owaspCLT-announce at meetup.com

<owasp-charlotte at lists.owasp.org <mailto:owasp-charlotte at lists.owasp.org>>



August 21st is my son's third birthday. As such I will not be at the
meeting scheduled for that evening. The meeting can still take place
with out me if there is enough interest. I can make sure the doors are
open, order pizza and drinks, etc. There is no speaker scheduled at the
moment, but I will take care of that as well if there is interest in
having a meeting. On the other hand you could just enjoy the night off.
:-). Rather than replying to this email please visit
http://www.meetup.com/owaspCLT/polls/604022/ to cast your vote. I know
it's easy to skip over such things during our busy days, but I'd prefer
to hear from you rather than assume your silence means you're not
interested. It'll take two seconds. Thanks.
