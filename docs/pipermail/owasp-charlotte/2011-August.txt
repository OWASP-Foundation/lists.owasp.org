I'm happy to chip in on the banner for the table.  Has anyone priced it out?

Denny:

That's awesome!  BUT
1) The Global Conferences Committee is going to loan us both for this go-round.
2) For future events, I'm not sure how to just donate directly to the
chapter.  i.e., we have an account through OWASP, and there's a way to
get your dues into that account, but nobody on the leadership lists
has given a good way to donate directly to a chapter.

I'm going to go ahead and ask them for some free swag, as well.  I
don't like to ask them to give stuff away, but since we're young, it
might be a good opportunity to help bootstrap the system.

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Next Meeting - Important Changes
Message-ID: <30D3FB6A-D998-4BD7-A1F7-9516ABAD0A0E@thestranathans.com>

Charlotte OWASP Chapter:

Our next scheduled meeting has changed dates to October 10, 2011 - the day BEFORE the UNCC Cyber Security Symposium.  It will be at 6:30pm in Woodward Hall room 130.

Our guest speaker for the October 10 meeting will be Jeff Williams.  Jeff is the volunteer Chair of the OWASP Foundation (!) and the CEO of Aspect Security (!) [https://www.aspectsecurity.com/].  He's written many publications on software security, and is really well known in the software security world.  He will be giving one of the keynote presentations at the Cyber Security Symposium the following day [http://cci.uncc.edu/security], and has been gracious enough to give a talk at our chapter meeting.  You can read more about Jeff at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Jeff_Williams .

If you've missed chapter meetings in the past, this is one you won't want to miss.  If you've been on the fence about coming, this is the time to come.  If you have friends you've been trying to get interested in Software Security, this is the talk to come see.

One logistic I'm not certain on at this point is parking.  Parking is ordinarily $6, however, it's the middle of the Fall Break at UNCC, so I don't know if parking will be charged during that time or not.  I will find out for sure and get back to you.  In the event that it's not free, in the past we've used the mailing list to arrange a meet-up outside the University and we'll ride-share in so that the cost of the parking is divided.

Thanks,
Will Stranathan
