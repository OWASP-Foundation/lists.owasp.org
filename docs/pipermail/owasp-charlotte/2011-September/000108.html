<PRE>Over the past year or so, folks have either posted vetted job leads directly to the list or asked me if posting those to the list is allowed.  We don't have an official stance on it, and as far as I can tell, OWASP in-general doesn't have an *official* stance on the matter.

I personally feel that it can be good because:
* It's a slow economy, and if this list can be of some genuine help to somebody, that makes me happy
* This is a professional organization - and part of the goal (as far as I know) of professional organizations is networking
* Folks on the list are by and large pretty responsible and we're able to police ourselves
sim
However, it does seem like the very sort of thing which might get out of hand pretty quickly.  If we're posting job leads, why not product advertisement?  (OWASP does not specifically endorse *any* commercial product - should the chapter mailing lists not also abide by that?)

So to that end, since it's come up more than once, I figure I'd share a couple of resources that *are* OWASP-endorsed.

1) <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Jobs">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Jobs</A> is a listing of jobs available in the appsec realm.  There's a link on there that says &quot;contact us&quot; if your organization is hiring and want to use that page as a means to get the word out.
2) There's a GLOBAL - Open Web Application Security (OWASP) group on LinkedIn - just search for OWASP
3) There's now an OWASP Charlotte group on LinkedIn.  If you're interested in sharing a job lead in the appsec field there, there's a Jobs section specifically for it.

So we're not going to start moderating the mailing list or anything.  But there are also those other means of letting others know about potential openings.  But if you've got a genuine lead and post it to the mailing list, I think we're all pretty responsible and can make mail filters or simply disregard the messages that don't interest us.
