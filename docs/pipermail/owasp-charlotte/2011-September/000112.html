<PRE>All,
I know this is still a few weeks away, but I HIGHLY recommend you come out
to see Jeff speak. He's a very smart, helpful guy. Whatever he presents,
you'll benefit from - and you get to chat with him in person. Like Will
mentioned, bring some friends too.
Thanks,
John

&gt;<i> Charlotte OWASP Chapter:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our next scheduled meeting has changed dates to October 10, 2011 - the day
</I>&gt;<i> BEFORE the UNCC Cyber Security Symposium.  It will be at 6:30pm in Woodward
</I>&gt;<i> Hall room 130.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our guest speaker for the October 10 meeting will be Jeff Williams.  Jeff
</I>&gt;<i> is the volunteer Chair of the OWASP Foundation (!) and the CEO of Aspect
</I>&gt;<i> Security (!) [<A HREF="https://www.aspectsecurity.com/].">https://www.aspectsecurity.com/].</A>  He's written many
</I>&gt;<i> publications on software security, and is really well known in the software
</I>&gt;<i> security world.  He will be giving one of the keynote presentations at the
</I>&gt;<i> Cyber Security Symposium the following day [<A HREF="http://cci.uncc.edu/security],">http://cci.uncc.edu/security],</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and has been gracious enough to give a talk at our chapter meeting.  You can
</I>&gt;<i> read more about Jeff at <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Jeff_Williams">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Jeff_Williams</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you've missed chapter meetings in the past, this is one you won't want
</I>&gt;<i> to miss.  If you've been on the fence about coming, this is the time to
</I>&gt;<i> come.  If you have friends you've been trying to get interested in Software
</I>&gt;<i> Security, this is the talk to come see.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One logistic I'm not certain on at this point is parking.  Parking is
</I>&gt;<i> ordinarily $6, however, it's the middle of the Fall Break at UNCC, so I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know if parking will be charged during that time or not.  I will find
</I>&gt;<i> out for sure and get back to you.  In the event that it's not free, in the
</I>&gt;<i> past we've used the mailing list to arrange a meet-up outside the University
</I>&gt;<i> and we'll ride-share in so that the cost of the parking is divided.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Will Stranathan
