Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Tomorrow's meeting
Message-ID: <c9f20f1c065a58f4d1fc9c03f96123ba@consoltec.net>

With things having stalled on discussions with some people that were 
interested in joining us tomorrow and the fact that many are still on 
vacation OWASP Charlotte will hold it's July monthly meeting virtually 
only via Google Hangouts. Event details here 
https://plus.google.com/events/clll22ubpi74j34u52sf35mf3qk. There should 
be a link to join the hangout, but if you need help just let me know.
