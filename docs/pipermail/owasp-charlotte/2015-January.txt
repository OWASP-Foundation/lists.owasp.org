Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Updates
Message-ID: <54AB35A0.5020000@owasp.org>

I wanted to let you know the current status of things concerning OWASP
Charlotte. My previous employer, Classic Graphics, continues to be an
awesome company to work for and with. They have agreed to continue to
host our monthly meeting, with free parking, and cover the costs of the
meetup.com site. For the most part things will largely stay the same for
the foreseeable future. This is good news for you and me.

Plans to line up a speaker fell through for January but I'm open to
having a meeting if there are things you want to discuss or just get
together and drink some beers (or cola, or coffee, or water ever) ;).

I'm still kicking around the idea of Saturday meetups that are more
workshopy in nature. Your ideas are welcome as always. I am also still
soliciting possible alternate locations for meetups to make it easier
for others to attend that find it difficult to get to the University area.

Also, if you know of anyone looking for a new job or a start in InfoSec
with a smallish company, great people, awesome atmosphere, please put me
in contact with them. I have been asked to help locate my replacement.
I'd prefer to recommend someone I know or know of that comes through
recommendation as well. Even if it is someone looking to get started.
I'd love to talk with them.

Next Tuesday's meeting is up in the air. With the speaker line up not
working out, the holidays, and job changes I have had my plate full. Let
me know what you'd like to do.

Jon,

Thanks very much for the update and congrats / good luck on the new job.

That's great news about being able to use the same place - thanks for
working that out!

Thanks,
John

I?m good for next Tuesday, I can probably throw something together. Unless some one else wants to do something? I know Matt Rose probably wouldn?t mind presenting something, perhaps we could do two smaller talks rather than one longer one? Thoughts? Discuss!

Jeremy Long, creator of Dependency-Check, will be in town next week. Just chatted with him, he said that he could give a presentation on Dependency-Check. I imagine Will and/or Jon might?ve already talked to him. I?ll be able to attend the meeting next Tuesday since I?ll be working up that way most of next week.

See you guys on Tuesday.

I would +1 for Jeremy talking. Depending on length of the presentation,
maybe have 1 or 2 smaller presentations. He probably could talk the whole
time though.

As of now, looks like freezing rain is supposed to start around 9-10. I'm
planning to be there unless things start to look dicey a lot earlier.
Thanks,

Unfortunately, I have another commitment tonight, so unless it gets
cancelled, it doesn't look like I'm going to be able to make it this month.
 :-(  See you all next month!

Best regards,
