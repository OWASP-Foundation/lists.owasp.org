<PRE>I don't have any real inroads to Hackerspace Charlotte, but I've been
to a few of their meetings and they're a welcoming and interesting
bunch of smart folks. I know at least a few of them are security
professionals. They recently hosted a presentation on rainbow tables,
and they host programming nights. I imagine they'd be open to other
presentations, and perhaps some will attend the OWASP meetings. I've
seen a couple of the UNCC students at Hackerspace Charlotte and OWASP
meetings. One kid is evidently a Dry Ice Jenga champion and a
lock-picking master. Maybe some of these students who do have strong
connections to Hackerspace can extend invitations to our next OWASP
meeting.

</I>&gt;<i> When we originally booted up, Mark worked on a canned presentation that folks could give at InfraGard, Charlotte ISSA, PHP User Group, Hackerspace Charlotte, 2600, etc. &#160;That presentation is available at <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/images/d/db/Charlotte_OWASP_Presentation_Template.ppt">https://www.owasp.org/images/d/db/Charlotte_OWASP_Presentation_Template.ppt</A> . &#160;I may brush that up a little bit to specifically mention AppSensor and ASIDE and maybe a couple of other items.

</I>&gt;<i> Does anybody have inroads into any of those above groups? &#160;I might have some limited inroads into a couple, but I think some other folks are more connected into some of those things.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We had a brief conversation the other day at the cyber security symposium (good to see some of you there) about marketing / advertising / planning for our meetings. It would be great if we had some people who are good at that and/or willing to try to help us out in that capacity. Charlotte is a big town and has lots of people that are (or at least should be) interested in security. We need to figure out a way to get in touch with them and get them involved. Also, if you have ideas, but can't help plan for some reason, let us know (or me privately) your ideas for reaching out to the community. Jeff said the New York OWASP chapter has ~200 people at their meetings every month. We may not get there this month or even year, but we have something to strive towards. There are easily thousands of developers/business folks/security people in Charlotte that are interested in security. We just have to find them and get the word out!
