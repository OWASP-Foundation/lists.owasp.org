<PRE>All,
We had a brief conversation the other day at the cyber security symposium
(good to see some of you there) about marketing / advertising / planning for
our meetings. It would be great if we had some people who are good at that
and/or willing to try to help us out in that capacity. Charlotte is a big
town and has lots of people that are (or at least should be) interested in
security. We need to figure out a way to get in touch with them and get them
involved. Also, if you have ideas, but can't help plan for some reason, let
us know (or me privately) your ideas for reaching out to the community. Jeff
said the New York OWASP chapter has ~200 people at their meetings every
month. We may not get there this month or even year, but we have something
to strive towards. There are easily thousands of developers/business
folks/security people in Charlotte that are interested in security. We just
have to find them and get the word out!

Thanks,
John
