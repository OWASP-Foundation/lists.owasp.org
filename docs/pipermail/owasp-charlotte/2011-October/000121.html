<PRE>All,
Some folks at OWASP suggested it might be a good idea if we pass this around
to our chapters. Below are links to the same presentation given at 2
different venues by Moxie Marlinspike, a very smart guy who does lots of
things, one of which is research into SSL. The talk is about what he
perceives as brokenness in SSL as it's currently implemented (specifically
related to the CA portion of the equation). It's a VERY good talk. I
wouldn't often recommend spending ~45 minutes listening to a recorded talk,
but I will for this one. He's also got a firefox plugin that implements his
suggested corrections to the system (convergence.io). OWASP is planning to
startup a convergence notary to help the project along, and that's what
spawned the conversation.

If anyone has any questions, voice them to the list or me privately. If
there's interest, this could be a topic we could touch on at the next
meetup.

quality, but no image of Moxie)

shows both Moxie speaking and the slides, but a lot of background noise)

Thanks,
John
