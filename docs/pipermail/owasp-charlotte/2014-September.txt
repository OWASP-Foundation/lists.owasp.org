So. You're the 400 lb. gorilla in the room? You're the force to be reckoned
with? This isn't your first rodeo. Etc., etc., etc.

Maybe you're more humble. You've been doing this a while. You know the
concepts. You've gone through all the demos you can find.  Heck, you may
have even uncovered a web vulnerability in a web app at work. Congrats!
Good for you.

Please remember that there are young and budding infosec pros that have a
thirst for such knowledge.

If the above is you please consider sharing what you know with the rest of
us. Don't be shy. We're all friends here. :-)

All of these would be focused on practical application

- behavioral security frameworks
- kill chain analysis
- threat modeling (lightweight)
- security at scale
- developer training
- effective enterprise security patterns
- security in highly distributed architectures (micro-services)
- monitoring inside applications (could be using normal dev tools)

I second John, especially in the following areas.

-behavioral security frameworks
-threat modeling (lightweight)
-security at scale
-effective enterprise security patterns
-monitoring inside applications (could be using normal dev tools) -- I
think this is the most critical need

Lastly I would add the following:
-Incident response -- Could go along with a monitoring discussion and I do
feel it is relevant to this group.

Hi leaders,

if for whatever reason you are unable to come to AppSecUSA in Denver,
here's a nice backup plan for you:
http://2014.appsecusa.org/2014/about/live-streaming/

Basically we are gonna stream on YouTube most of the content from the main
tracks + the keynotes.

For real time updates follow @AppSecUSA on Twitter
https://twitter.com/appsecusa.

After the stream, all recorded talks will be uploaded as well so make sure
you check out that YouTube playlist:
