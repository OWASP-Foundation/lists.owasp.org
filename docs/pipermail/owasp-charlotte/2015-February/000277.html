<PRE>If interested, please forward your resume to me. See below for the 
current job description:

    tools including Nessus, Metasploit, Kali and others.

The position would work to support multiple clients and engagements 
performing security assessments and pen testing.  Currently there are 
three clients (with more to come) lined up with security vulnerability 
assessment work required; therefore we are seeking someone who can hit 
the ground running.  Experience working as a part of a red team and 
knowledge of key ways to exploit systems during pen tests is required.

comfortable with minimal / occasional travel should it be required.  We

occasion.  All travel costs (flight, hotel, etc) would be covered.
