What will they be here for - the chapter meeting? Is there a topic?

Thanks,
John

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] December Meeting
Message-ID: <dce3191c50788b3af5787bc47cbb4436@consoltec.net>

We're going to try something a little different for our next meeting on 
December 18th 2012. A couple of people at the last meeting asked if we 
were going to cancel it due to it being so close to the holidays. I 
hadn't really thought about it, but with some of you being students and 
all you could be out of town spending time with families. The idea of 
holding one of our meetings over google hangouts has been brought up a 
couple of times and I even have a couple offers from people interested 
in presenting remotely to do so on GH. Will used to have a named hangout 
back when Google still allowed you to named hangouts. This isn't the 
case any more, as far as I can tell. As it stands right now Will and I 
are going to discuss and share PHP static code analysis tools. Anyone 
else that has something they want to share or delve into can if time 
permits and there's enough interest. Until then I'll be digging into 
http://phpmd.org. I'm going to run it against a default Drupal download 
and see what it turns up. Please pass this along to anyone who you think 
would enjoy this. I'm planning on being present at our regular place at 
the regular time. It will just be easier for me, from a distraction 
point of view, to do it there. You're more than welcome to come out and 
join me. One cool feature of GH is the live streaming option. It will be 
broadcast to my youtube page at http://youtube.com/rjmolesa. Even if you 
don't want to participate but don't want to miss anything you can check 
out the live stream.

Message-ID: <287d9416213559885d3008aace12eb09@consoltec.net>

Hello everyone,

I just wanted to pass along https://hack.me/. It's a site chocked full 
of intentionally vulnerable web apps for you to practice and learn on. I 
haven't spent more than 20 minutes on the site so far, but it looks 
interesting.

Also, if you're looking for something local, and more like a "guided tour",
Mutillidae will walk you through lots of different types of hacks, although
not really give a lot of indication as to *why* you would want to do it.
http://goo.gl/mYDEU .

It runs fine in the BitNami stack or on a VM. There are a couple of
"normal" PHP options that you may have to turn off.

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] REST Security
Message-ID: <CAA8E+YfJHk9aHHN40qgYD-D-C25OrQtrcXQLgHYOg6Xj4e84iA@mail.gmail.com>

One of the important functions of a local chapter is to be involved in
giving stuff back to OWASP. Yes - we should all listen and learn from
industry experts, be consumers of some of the great OWASP tools and
documentation available, but we should also be producers.

If you were to search on Google for "REST security" the very first thing
that comes up is a cheatsheet on the OWASP site (and this is how it should
be). However, this document still says it's in DRAFT. A couple of leaders
have decided to look at it and see if it can be pushed over the hill, but
there's still an opportunity there.

Somewhat-related - I'm looking around to see if there's like an "OWASP Help
Wanted" sign or anything where project leaders have a pretty well-defined
understanding of what needs to be done, but no people to do it. If there
are any things like that out there, I'll see if anybody here wants to help.

Also, don't forget to RSVP on the meetup for the December meeting by Google
Hangout. Jon is going to talk a bit about PHPMD, and I'll be doing a quick
demo of some of the really cool features of PMD (different project, similar
letters).
