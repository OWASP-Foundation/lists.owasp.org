Hi,

My name is Jason Edgecombe.
I am a web developer in the College of Arts & Sciences at UNCCharlotte.

I currently administer a few linux boxes and write code for web 
applications when I'm not dragged into other support issues.

I've coded in Perl, PHP, Java, and Ruby on Rails.

I'm not likely to go to any meetings, but I'm looking forward to 
exchanging tips with local people.

Sincerely,
Jason Edgecombe

Message-ID: <A2D52135-612F-4222-8C0C-9F915E5C092F@bellsouth.net>

I thought I'd start a message thread regarding risk rating on  
apparent input validation errors that an application doesn't filter  
and yet doesn't appear to be (or just isn't) susceptible to from an  
injection perspective.  For example, a web application whose form  
fields and POST method will allow any number of special characters  
such as: *, ', %, !,|, \x,... and these characters are just accepted  
by the application and stored in the backend rdbms.  For instance,  
the user's name might appear now as: "Name= '1=1 OR SELECT * FROM  
DICT" and "Street Address = %2a%20", etc.  Because the application  
uses java.sql.PreparedStatements or rdbms StoredProcedures, the data  
is passed as precompiled binary or parametric data before it reaches  
the rdbms and is therefore not interpreted as a normal SQL string  
would be, essentially rendering the site immune, to some degree, from  
these types of data and command injections.

That's not to say it's a no-risk scenario.  There is still a  
vulnerability that would only be realized when the records are  
read... imagine a "Name=<script language=javascript>alert 
(document.cookie)</script>" which was stored on the backend, and  
everytime some one views this record their session mgmt token is  
displayed as a popup, or another example, a similar string is pushed  
into an internal logging mechanism like Log4J/NET using a similar  
technique that will now display the admin's session credential when  
she reviews the log files for the previous business day (heh,  
assuming this ever happens in the real world).  One could redirect  
this information from the DOM to another site where the credentials  
could be harvested (but only if the field length was sufficiently  
long to allow for this).

I've always considered this type of vulnerability as low, and would  
be curious as to how you guys would think about it.

My first inclination is to say that there is no issue -- this is an OUTPUT
VALIDATION problem. The downstream application should do the filtering. I'll
write more later.

My sentiments exactly.  There's no such thing as "malicious
characters".  However, control characters for the presentation layer
need to be properly escaped at the point of presentation.  For
example, HTML Injection (cross-site scripting) is PROPERLY remediated
by performing output filtering (who knows how the data got there?)
SQL Injection is PROPERLY remediated by using prepared
statements/parameterized queries.  My rationale for this is this:

1) There are a million different ways to encode the rotten characters
going into the application, all of which need to be considered, but
only ONE way to properly encode them going to whatever downstream
presentation is next.
2) (This is probably most important), when using input validation to
stop "malicious" characters, you have a blacklist, but then every
input you have to make exceptons to the blacklist.  So you truly have
as many different fixes as you do inputs into the application.  When
you use output filtering, you have exactly ONE fix for each
presentation layer (SQL is one fix, HTML is one fix, LDAP is one fix,
etc.)  This makes the life of the programmer simpler and more
consistent.  We can actually give programmers ONE rule that works 100%
of the time, but we can't ever seem to give them ONE blacklist they
can use 100% of the time.
3) "Malicious" characters could be completely legitimate in the
application (for example, if my last name was O'Neil, or if I'm
designing a math forum where I need < and >)
4) "Malicious" characters may not be "malicious" in every presentation
downstream - < and > don't do anything rotten to a PDF, but stripping
them or encoding them before storage would cause them to render
improperly in the resulting document.
5) There's no telling where the data got INTO the application.
Consider persisted cross-site scripting - if the application does
input validation all over the place, it doesn't stop a DBA from
putting malicious HTML or script code directly into the database.

I'm not saying NEVER do input validation.  But I highly recommend
BUSINESS RULE INPUT VALIDATION and ALWAYS use output filtering.  (Most
English surnames do not have digits in them, for example.)

All of this leads me to my biggest gripe against the OWASP Top-10.
SQL Injection is a subset of Command Injection (properly, IMO), but
Cross-site Scripting is documented as a separate type of
vulnerability, but ultimately, it's just another form of command
injection.

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Message Thread: Risk Rating on REGEX violations
In-Reply-To: <d36d3d90605300914p25b87a13xb9c2ba15619355d5@mail.gmail.com>

I think it all comes done to how exploitable this could be in the future.  I remember the old days
when we rated XSS as low because it required user action (click through or open up a web page). 
However, giving the newer attack vectors and motivations, we started to give it higher rating. 

The primary attack vector for Regex violation is most likely XSS.  From an attackers perspective,
if it takes more than two steps to exploit the vulnerability, i.e. click through or launch the
page to the malicious site with more than two clicks, it becomes painful to construct a viable
exploit.  

Until a viable exploit comes out, I am incline to give it a low rating.  Of course, things change
in our field pretty quickly, so we shall see.
