This Tuesday, August 12th, please join @OWASPCharlotte and Kunal Anand
(@ka) from @Privoty as he takes us "Beyond the perimeter" with some great
stories. Kunal has worked at NASA, mySpace, BBC, and is the CTO and
Co-Founder of Previty. I'll be sure to have plenty of pizza and we'll even
auto-submit CPE's to ISC2 for your attendance. All you have to do is make
some time for a great evening of food, fun, and WebAppSec.
