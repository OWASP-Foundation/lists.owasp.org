From another project I'm working on, I was asked if there is any *good* defensive programming training.  I wasn't aware of anything, and one person had mentioned an OWASP project working toward making some SCORM-compatible content but free.  I haven't found that yet, but I did stumble upon this:  http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Appsec_Tutorial_Series.  The first video is available on line, and it's pretty high quality.  I don't necessarily agree with all the presentation, but it's a pretty good thing to show coders who aren't familiar with application security.

Anybody aware of anything else?  Is that something worth getting plugged into?

Will,
I think the "training" at OWASP is pretty weak so far, but Sandra Paiva is
working on some of that as I understand it.  I think the appsec tutorial
series is a "dip a toe in the water" effort, and will be a decent
introduction to basic concepts, but won't get you very far.  I also think
that SANS has a couple language-specific courses in this space, at least I
remember a Java one.  I believe Frank Kim (from thinksec) teaches that one.
Also, Jim Manico (project lead for ESAPI) does training as well.  Not sure
what your exact needs are, but those are a couple options.
Thanks,
John

I wasn't looking for anything specific.  I was working with an open-source developer, telling him things that were wrong with his code, and he was very interested in learning about the things we do without having to spend a lot of money to go through a good training program.  I suppose I learned by experience, rather than by a program, but I had time as an apprentice to learn.
