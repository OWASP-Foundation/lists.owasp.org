This Thursday June 11, 2015 OWASP will hold it's next meeting. Talk topics
are listed below and include one of our own. It isn't often that someone
very local shares their hard won knowledge with the rest of us. Please come
out. Tell, or better yet, drag the infosec n00b that you know out to meet
some cool people.

Firetalk - How to secure a 5 character password? *Rob Taylor*
Main: Security at a Scale *Rob Taylor*

We'll also have pizza and CPEs.

One bit of business. We're seeking nominations to identify my replacement.
After that we will vote. So come one, come all. And yes, I'll still be
involved. Just not as the organizer.

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] FYI: Emergency Family Issue
Message-ID: <CAEOipxdfKa+HbCWROHfW9DVQ0Msz+42pT6ym4X_DUkVgaBnHLA@mail.gmail.com>

Rob Taylor, our presenter for the evening has a family medial emergency
that he has to attend to. He is on his way to Raleigh at the moment. Please
keep him and his family in your thoughts and prayers.

I appreciate all of the RSVPs for this meetup, but it looks like we are
without a topic and presenter for the evening. I will be there and we can
discuss anything you like. But I wanted you to know so that you can decide
for yourself if you still want to attend this evening.

Thank you.

Thanks for the heads up Jon and we'll be praying for Rob and family for
sure.

I still plan to attend. If we run out of things to discuss, I'm happy to
get feedback from folks about the owasp appsensor UI work that is just
starting (
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_oMWXgPWP0GfwiQiVPTNzYZpYmJb9wvnlr_DVm6JHcM/edit?usp=sharing)
as well as input about the appsensor presentation I'll be doing at owasp
appsecusa.

Thanks,
John
