<PRE>At our last meeting it was decided that we would begin meeting on the
second Tuesday of each month rather than the third. Every other detail
remains the same.

I am no longer going to order pizza as there doesn't seem to be enough
interest to cover the cost of doing so. I don't know who was the last
person to drink from the 2 litter of Seria Mist at the last meeting
but you really set me up the bomb. The lid was properly replaced on
the bottle. As a result I had a 2 litter of sugary soda all over my
seat, floor, left over pizza, and partially on my new back pack. I
suppose someone will say that I should have checked the lids first,
but honestly I've never had to before. It is something I will remember
to do from now on however.

I have a couple of prospects willing to present at our next meeting
but nothing confirmed as of yet. So if you know someone, or you have
something of interest to the group that you'd be willing to share
please let me know.

Our next meeting will be held on Tuesday, March 12th 2013 at Classic
Graphics. Meet and greet starts at 6:30 with the topic of discussion
set for 7:00. Let me know if you have any questions or if your
conscience gets to you enough that you want to offer to have my truck
cleaned. :-)
