I've been giving this a bit more of a think. Our bee club has a board of
9 members in addition to the active board. The full board looks like:

President
Vice-President
Secretary
Treasurer

Then there is a 5 member board around that known as the executive board.

1 seat is filled by the past president and he remains until the current
president becomes the past president.

The program chair, who is responsible for finding the speakers and
arranging a meeting place. Though we have a regular meeting place nailed
down. They serve until they no longer wish to.

Then there are 3 seats that serve for 3 years and the positions are
staggered such that one seat becomes open each year. These are elected
positions.

I don't think this club is of the size that it requires such management,
but it's something to keep in the back of your minds. Maybe something to
revisit down the road.

However, the one position I'd like to duplicate and add to the list is
that of past president. I see the professional representative equivalent
to that of the program chair with a bit more functionality. 

Also, somethings worth considering and we should decide on at the next
meeting is:

- Are they voted or appointed positions?
- Do these board seats have term limits?

Personally I'm not in favor of term limits as it is hard enough finding
people willing to work, and secondly a term limit could force someone
that's doing a really good job to step down and possibly put someone in
place that has no real interest in serving just to fulfil term limit
requirements. But I think it's something we should decide as a group.

As a side note does anyone have someone in mind as a speaker for this
month?

	6:30 PM @ Classic Graphics
Message-ID: <4ba3fff4eda97ba90395748cd1adc4b6@consoltec.net>

 Greetings,

 Our next meeting will be held this Wednesday March 21st, 6:30PM. Our 
 speaker for the evening is Matthew Rose from HP. There will be pizza and 
 drinks provided once again, but please consider pitching in $5 if you 
 can. Parking is free. If you need help getting there just ping me. We'll 
 have signs up with the OWASP Charlotte logo on them to help direct 
 traffic in the building.

 We'll do 30 mins of meet and greet with the presentation starting at 
 7:00 PM. Once that is over we need to finalize the board structure and 
 members. Jay made some good proposals that I happen to agree with.

 Here's a Google map link http://g.co/maps/5zgwt for directions to the 
 building. We're in the old IBM building.

 I hop to see you there.

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Code Jam: PHP Validation Library
Message-ID: <CAA8E+Ye0Kq3DaJYkEJGaJF90tkAYztOn8hTOynThggW5Tjs4_w@mail.gmail.com>

I would like for starters to begin working on a PHP data validation
framework. Not dissimilar from JSR-303, but being PHP, I'd like a lot
less overhead.

What *I* would LIKE to see in such a framework is:
* Something familiar to PHP programmers - i.e., let's not write a Java
validation framework in PHP, but lets do things the way PHP people are
accustomed to.
* Something deliberate - as a security practitioner, I've never seen a
good validation framework where validation is done transparently and
automatically - this almost universally means "make sure we don't
allow bad data", but nobody knows what all bad data will look like.
You have to choose to use (or not use) this. And you have to choose
the right validators to use.
* Something consistent - whatever pattern we choose to use to
implement this should be consistent regardless of the type of data
you're producing, and errors should be handled consistently across the
board. We can't return NULL for some functions and throw exceptions
for others or raise E_ERROR for yet others
* Something imperative - this one I'm flexible on. But lots of apps
try to make things declarative, so in addition to learning the
language and framework, you have to learn a new XML schema or a new
YAML schema or a new DSL. PHP isn't compiled, so calling validation
routines explicitly and imperatively is not much more difficult than
writing an XML file. As I said, I'm more flexible on this one.
* Something that's a joy to use - at least for PHP programmers.
Whatever we make should be fun enough to use that you want to do it
some more. JSR-303 is kinda' like this. I did something that looked
like rocket science, but it wasn't really that hard, but it makes
writing the code so much more fun.

For this code jam, I need a few people (no more than 5). A good mix
will be people will include
* people who use PHP for a living and can really answer the first two
items and the last. What frameworks have you used in the past that
remind you how great it is to be a PHP programmer? What design
patterns did they use that make you happy? How can we apply that to a
new library/framework? (I started something using magic methods, but
I'm certain it's not how PHP programmers are accustomed to working).
* a scribe. Initially we're going to be planning a framework and not
just jump in writing code. We need somebody who can document the
requirements really well
* coders - if you've got a little PHP experience or a lot is fine -
once we determine the design pattern, the rest should mostly fall into
place.

We can either use a Google+ Hangout or GoToMeeting to do this. If we
use GoToMeeting, I need a bit of advance notice to get it all set up
through OWASP. I've used Google+ Hangouts in the past and they work
really well for this sort of thing as we can edit documents
collaboratively (as in multiple people typing simultaneously) screen
share an editor, have video and voice chat, etc. I think the first
session of this we should probably plan on an hour for starters, then
see if there's a division of labor that reveals itself from that.

Tuesdays and Thursdays work best for me, although I'm teaching next Thursday.

Anybody available next Tuesday night - maybe 8pm-9pm?

This seems like an interesting project. I don't know how much time I'd 
have to spare, but I would be willing to lend a hand where I can. I'm 
new to the mailing list (Hi!), but this seems like a good way to get 
more involved in the group. My background is primarily in PHP development.

Wow - I'm very sorry about that - the PHP Code Jam for Tuesday from
8-9 has NOT been cancelled, I just removed the mailing list from the
invites since it appears that that just caused a whole slew of ugly
spam chaos.

Please forgive me. If you plan on attending, please email and let me
know, and I'll add you personally to the invite.

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Google Hangout Change

Well, the PHP Code Jam was productive in spite of the snafu with the
Google Hangout.

It turns out that if you use the original URL I sent out for the
hangout, there's a good possibility that you might end up in a hangout
without anybody else in it. So update your bookmarks:

https://plus.google.com/hangouts/extras/talk.google.com/owasp-clt .

I'm very sorry to those of you who attended the code jam last night
and missed it due to my own ignorance of how the domain thing works
out with those. We'll figure out another night to do it. We did make a
few decisions late in the process, and I'll try to distill those
bullets and mail out to the group later on.
