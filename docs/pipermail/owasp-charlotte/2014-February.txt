Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] February meeting
Message-ID: <CAA8E+Yda8d8S8fP9QFxD4Pja0VH+Sb_xh_s-tgge+bQHRxBzbQ@mail.gmail.com>

On February 11, I'll be covering Content Security Policy - a method of
mitigating the risks associated with content injection type attacks.

If you wanted to begin playing around with it, I threw together a devbox
for doing demos, but it seems the slides have gotten so much effort that
I've not worked much on demos - or in the end, demos are boring with
Content Security Policy. You can clone the devbox repo here:
https://github.com/colezlaw/owasp-clt-csp

Looking forward to presenting. If you've got any questions about the
devbox, let me know.

Message-ID: <CAEOipxe+h++uWHHEYuecYxMrbC=htPH6B-Lukr4R_6ZVn34K_g@mail.gmail.com>

Tonight's meeting will take place online only via GHOA (Google's Hangouts
on Air). Will Stranathan is doing a follow-up to his last talk. He is going
to share his knowledge of Content Security Policy with us. Since this will
be a HOA you can watch via the Youtube feed found at
http://youtube.com/rjmolesa. If you want to ask a question look for the Ask
A Question button and I'll make sure to get it to Will for answering. The
presentation will be archived there as well. Feel free to watch again later
and share with others. Please forward this email to anyone you think would
be interested in securing the web. See you tonight!
