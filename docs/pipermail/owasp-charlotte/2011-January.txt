Hey all. My name is Jon Molesa. I work for a growing printing company
in Charlotte, that uses web technologies extensively. My background is
in web development and linux system administration. I personally run a
mix of linux distributions and freebsd. I'm interested in learning new
things all the time. I have too many interests to focus on just one
thing. I hope to learn more about the threats that are out there, how 
to
recognize them, and how to protect against them. Personally I'm hoping
to meet some cool guys in the field that have interesting things to
share.

Has a meeting been scheduled for 2011 yet?

Welcome to the gang, Jon.  I think you'll have a good opportunity to
learn some things (and probably teach some, too).

It looks like our next meeting will probably be January 26, but I'm
waiting on final confirmation before I send that out.

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] January Meeting and Other News
Message-ID: <AANLkTim4V_U2XhDWd=bNmm+w_VgvDkmXpyMbgfM_f4Y3@mail.gmail.com>

We have confirmed a date and time.  Our next meeting will be
Wednesday, January 26 at 6pm, somewhere at UNC Charlotte.  We should
have a specific room soon.  UNC Charlotte has been gracious enough to
host us.  You'll need to bring $6 (I believe) for parking, unless you
have a UNCC parking pass.  I'll send the room information as soon as I
have it.  We'll talk about potential OWASP projects for us to adopt.
See http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project to see if
there are any projects that interest you, or bring ideas for new
projects to work on.  Bill Chu, Department Chair of the College of
Computing and Informatics will be presenting ASIDE, an IDE plugin for
assisting developers in writing defensive code from the beginning.

Also, thanks to Brent Harrington, we have an official OWASP Charlotte
logo!  He's also spent a lot of time putting together a Power Point
template that is distinctly OWASP Charlotte.  You can see a lot of the
new "branding" on the Twitter site at
http://twitter.com/OWASPCharlotte.  We'll post news there, as well, so
give it a follow.

And in other news, Mark Cimijotti has put together a straw-man
presentation for doing an "elevator pitch" for OWASP Charlotte with
other local professional or user groups that might have some interest
in OWASP Charlotte.

Thanks to Brent and Mark for giving us an image and presentation materials!

Finally, if you haven't introduced yourself to the list, let us all
know who you are, what you do, and what you hope to get out of OWASP
Charlotte.

Regards,
Will

Message-ID: <AANLkTikKwvi9WKh-FVOHKXDeN0=zv-ov_yi4oVtzsUJO@mail.gmail.com>

For anybody who's not interested in paying for parking at UNCC, I'll
be leaving the Chick-Fil-A at Harris and 85 about 5:40 or so.
(http://is.gd/vUfFrg-).  If you want to ride share, only one of us
will have to pay for parking, and I've got mine covered.

The meeting is at 6pm at Woodward Hall room 120.  Woodward Hall
(http://is.gd/Q8QYZB-) is on the corner of Cameron and Craver - across
from the new-ish student parking deck and the new-ish lot.

Hope to see you then!
