<PRE>This is one of the worst articles I have read about XSS. 
 
First of all, the author's attack on JavaScript completely is unfounded.
Injection attacks (like XSS) are not caused by languages but by
application design. Whenever an application generates another
application (think of a Java web app generating an HTML or JavaScript
&quot;application&quot; to be evaluated by the user's browser) it is the sole
responsibility of the first application to know what it is generating.
Who would argue that SQL is to blame when an application uses String
concatenation to create a SQL inject vulnerability when the designers
could have otherwise used a prepared statement.
 
Second, the author also makes several statements which are either
incorrect or lacking in detail. Of course, I'll back that with a few
examples:
 
1) XSS is not a real security vulnerability in a product or script since
it does not directly result in the loss of data integrity, but rather
can be used as a tool in social engineering
&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28computer_security%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28computer_security%29</A>
&gt;<i>  attacks and can never compromise the security of a server/host under
</I>any conditions nor that of an end-user on its own.
 
- Social engineering is not required for XSS attacks. Consider a
persistent XSS attack on a dating site in which the exploiting code is
stored on a user's public profile and rendered whenever someone looks at
this user's profile. Social engineering is not required for an attack as
it is the purpose of the site to allow users to browse and find profiles
on their own before viewing them.
 
2) [...] the attacker has to rely on the user having the information he
or she would like to &quot;steal&quot; available, and that the browser doesn't
block such an attack.
 
- This is true for a particular type of attack (perhaps one the author
recently had to deal with), but does not pertain to all XSS attacks. The
information the user would like to steal is commonly within the cookie,
though could be as simple as one or more input fields on the vulnerable
page. Depending on the browser to block XSS attacks is ridiculous. I
agree a few changes could be made to prevent obvious attacks (who needs
an &lt;img/&gt; tag that points to another domain?) though even these
preventions are questionable, not to mention common attacks such as
changing the target URL for a form.
 
 
I will stop here because I could spend a lot of time on this :) In
general, I would suggest this article be take with a whole shaker of
salt. I like some of the points I believe are between the lines of the
article (such as the lack of security considerations inherit in
browsers); however, I would be hard-pressed to agree with any of his
views on XSS.
