Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Meeting reminder for Thursday March 9th
Message-ID: <CAEOipxdywMF5LrZJKOfo3-cUxZeEDSz_VfhakZ2n3g50TNeRUA@mail.gmail.com>

We have some important matters to discuss this month. As most of you know
I've been organizing the meetings for a while. According to our meeting
minutes, I hae been in this role since February 22, 2012. So a little
longer than 2 years. I have enjoyed it and appreciate the opportunity to
serve the Charlotte OWASP Chapter. It's time that step down and give others
that are interested in leading a chance to do so.

I'll make the announcement official at the meeting and open the floor to
nominations. We'll then vote on those individuals.

So please plan on being there and make sure your voice is heard.

Thanks again for a great time these last 2 years.

And I do plan on sticking around. Just a little more in the background.
