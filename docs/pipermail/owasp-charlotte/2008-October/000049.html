<PRE>Greetings Charlotte OWASP Member,

I assume that it has been a while since you have received active content
from this list. Many of you may still no longer be active members, but I
would like to re-engage you.

My name is Michael Menefee, OWASP Raleigh Chapter Leader, and I have
recently petitioned to merge the Charlotte and Raleigh chapters into a
single North Carolina chapter. As it stands, there are still 2 chapters, but
I am now chapter leader of both, and I would like to get the Charlotte
community re-engaged.

We are planning an NC OWASP event this January, and would like to hold it in
Charlotte if there is enough interest on your behalf.

Web Application Security is bigger than ever, and there is a constant need
for collaberation, community effort, training and new software and
policy/procedure development efforts to help all of our organizations
acheive a better level of security and awareness. We want to be the NC
resource for providing the necessary evaluation tools, development
frameworks and management-level initiatives to build a collaberative
environment that will make all of our businesses a safer online place to do
business.

Please respond to this email with your interest in continued involvement
with OWASP and let me know if an event in Charlotte would be right for you.
Let me know what issues you are interested in, and we can arrange OWASP
industry leaders to attend as guest speakers based on your requirements.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response!

Regards,

*Michael S. Menefee, CISSP* *(#43728)
*Principal Consultant, Secure Solve Inc.
