Message-ID: <CAEOipxcP4oUnoHuAa0Toj97uA9aTs2VWt1ugKAouofoBAy=5vQ@mail.gmail.com>

Our next meeting is to be held Tuesday April 9th at Classic Graphics.
We'll have the usual meet and greet from 6:30 - 7:00 PM. Matt Rose
will be presenting on mobile threats and the OWASP Mobile top 10. He
has agreed to supply pizza for the evening. So, if you come hungry, we
should be able to help you with that.

I hope to see you Tuesday night.
