I'm getting ready to put out a press release in the local newspapers and 
TV/Radio stations so I want to check and see who's already online ... if 
you received this you are a charter member of the Charlotte Chapter.... 
Please reply when you have a chance.

Not exactly a charter member, but I parused the list archives, and I am here.

Does years of experience writing insecure code count as interest in secure code?

Interesting post from a guy who's presenting at one of the chapter 
meetings.  I've heard rumors that some eCommerce execs bought into RSA's 
solution for BofA.  Does anyone know if this is a reality or if some one 
from that team would like to be a presenter at our first meeting?

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] owasp charlotte kickoff presentation ideas
Message-ID: <423A535D.3080902@bellsouth.net>

How about if we have an OWASP Top Ten presentation or a presentation of 
the OWASP Guide to Securing Applications during our kickoff meeting.  
Heck, since I worked on them maybe I should present them?  Anyone else 
want to present something at the kickoff meeting?  I need some feedback 
from folks for the press release.  Any ideas or energy around this 
topic?  Most of the other startup chapters are beginning with an owasp 
doc to get things started and it seems to be working really well in 
other areas.  It's agreed Charlotte is a much smaller demographic than 
most of the others, but we have some powerhouse companies here and 
there's bound to be interest in it.  Or, alternatively I could finish 
the framework for GoatBank.NET and present that and ask for help 
finishing it from our chapter members.  Any ideas?
