A few corrections for tonight:
The reception begins at 5 in Cone room 210
So the meeting could start as early as 6, and it's in room 112.

Because the previous announcement said 6:30, we'll meet and greet for a bit
before Scott gets started on his presentation of Threat Modeling in Amazon
Web Services.

Hope to see you there.
