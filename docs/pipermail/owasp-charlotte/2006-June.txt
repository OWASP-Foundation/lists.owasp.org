So, when is the next in person meeting? It'd be nice to actually meet some
of you folks. I think we should meet at Mellow Mushroom in NoDa sometime
soon. They always have plenty of space.

Mellow Mushroom is a great idea, i vote "yes".

In addition to having great pizza they have an awe-inspiring  
selection of beer.  ;)

What looks good on folks calendars?  I'm in Dallas over the next  
couple weeks (through next Thursday), and then I think I'll be in  
Jersey City for a week but I'm not sure yet.  Then I have a month- 
long endeavor in Colorado during July, so could we shoot for either  
late next week (Friday) or the last week in June?

And if anybody wants to bring photocopies of their ID, I can issue 10
Thawte WoT points, or 35 CA Cert WoT points.  The 10 Thawte won't get
you far, but they will certainly help me.

I completely disagree.  It's a result of poor programming - it's just
like any other command injection - HTML Injection can be just as bad -
if I load a nassssty <applet> tag, or falsify information or
something.  Javascript isn't to blame, because bad guys will find new
ways to exploit the laziness of developers in Flash, HTML, Java, SQL,
command lines, XML, XSLT, LDAP, and a whole bunch of other TLA's.
Developers need to make sure what they send to the presentation layer
is appropriate for that type of presentation.

The beginning of it is technically correct - what we GENERALLY
classify as "Cross-site Scripting" is technically either HTML
Injection or Script Injection - cross-site scripting involves reading
script data from another site through frames or otherwise.  But
generally, that sort of cross-frame communication is not allowed by
the browsers anymore.

Common guys, this is the story 5 years ago.  He is rather late joining the discussion, and he is
rather cluelss.  Blaming JavaScript or other scripting language for XSS problem is like blaming
knife ownership for some wacko stabbing Monica Seles.

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] XSS Article on Slashdot
In-Reply-To: <d36d3d90606230654y49267ad0r6352b166238f7007@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <3E475912BEFC1C47B9C2304DB682CC6F2A5FE6@BFEXCH1.benefitfocus.com>

This is one of the worst articles I have read about XSS. 
 
First of all, the author's attack on JavaScript completely is unfounded.
Injection attacks (like XSS) are not caused by languages but by
application design. Whenever an application generates another
application (think of a Java web app generating an HTML or JavaScript
"application" to be evaluated by the user's browser) it is the sole
responsibility of the first application to know what it is generating.
Who would argue that SQL is to blame when an application uses String
concatenation to create a SQL inject vulnerability when the designers
could have otherwise used a prepared statement.
 
Second, the author also makes several statements which are either
incorrect or lacking in detail. Of course, I'll back that with a few
examples:
 
1) XSS is not a real security vulnerability in a product or script since
it does not directly result in the loss of data integrity, but rather
can be used as a tool in social engineering
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28computer_security%29
>  attacks and can never compromise the security of a server/host under
any conditions nor that of an end-user on its own.
 
- Social engineering is not required for XSS attacks. Consider a
persistent XSS attack on a dating site in which the exploiting code is
stored on a user's public profile and rendered whenever someone looks at
this user's profile. Social engineering is not required for an attack as
it is the purpose of the site to allow users to browse and find profiles
on their own before viewing them.
 
2) [...] the attacker has to rely on the user having the information he
or she would like to "steal" available, and that the browser doesn't
block such an attack.
 
- This is true for a particular type of attack (perhaps one the author
recently had to deal with), but does not pertain to all XSS attacks. The
information the user would like to steal is commonly within the cookie,
though could be as simple as one or more input fields on the vulnerable
page. Depending on the browser to block XSS attacks is ridiculous. I
agree a few changes could be made to prevent obvious attacks (who needs
an <img/> tag that points to another domain?) though even these
preventions are questionable, not to mention common attacks such as
changing the target URL for a form.
 
 
I will stop here because I could spend a lot of time on this :) In
general, I would suggest this article be take with a whole shaker of
salt. I like some of the points I believe are between the lines of the
article (such as the lack of security considerations inherit in
browsers); however, I would be hard-pressed to agree with any of his
views on XSS.
