<PRE>The OWASP Chapter for Charlotte is back!  With that, there are several news items:

As per before, you can see all the latest information, etc. on the OWASP wiki.  The Charlotte page is at <A HREF="http://owasp.org/index.php/Charlotte">http://owasp.org/index.php/Charlotte</A>

On Tuesday, November 2, we'll have our first &quot;re-meeting&quot; somewhere in the Cone building at UNCC at 6:30 PM.  Tuesday is the UNCC Cyber-Security Symposium (<A HREF="http://cci.uncc.edu/?q=events/11th-annual-cyber-security-symposium">http://cci.uncc.edu/?q=events/11th-annual-cyber-security-symposium</A>), and the UNCC OWASP Chapter will be partnering with us this time around.  Since this is short notice, I anticipate we'll be using the mailing list primarily for the time being as we make decisions about what projects to work on and what problems to solve.  I think that our &quot;second first meeting&quot; will be sometime in January.  For now, we'll work with the University for location as it's consistent, cheap, and we can align our meetings with those of the University chapter.

We'll also have a booth set up at the Cyber Security Symposium.  Swing by during the breaks and meet some of the folks involved.

We also have a Twitter account now - @OWASPCharlotte (<A HREF="http://twitter.com/OWASPCharlotte">http://twitter.com/OWASPCharlotte</A>).  If that's your favorite means of keeping up-to-date on things we'll keep it updated.

As always, you can manage your mailing list subscription at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-Charlotte">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-Charlotte</A> .
