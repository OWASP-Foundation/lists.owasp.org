Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Meeting tomorrow night
Message-ID: <c3232ba82bcf86e230a1c1e57ae636ff@consoltec.net>

This is just a reminder that we have a meeting tomorrow night. Visit 
http://www.meetup.com/owaspclt to RSVP and for the address. Especially 
if you want to eat pizza. I'm only ordering enough pizza for folks that 
have RSVP'd. Please bring a few dollars to help cover the cost of the 
pizza if you can.

John Melton is going to update us on AppSensor and the GSOC project.

Bill Chu is going to talk about their research into Interactive Static 
Analysis as well.

I'm looking forward to tomorrow night already. I really hope to see you 
there. If you have something cool and interesting you'd like to share 
with the group please come prepared to talk and discuss about it as 
well. Geeks love to geek out on this stuff.



PS: If you're looking for Classic Graphics on Google Maps or GPS use 
8335 IBM Drive as your destination. The new address of 8335 Classic 
Drive has not been updated everywhere just yet.
