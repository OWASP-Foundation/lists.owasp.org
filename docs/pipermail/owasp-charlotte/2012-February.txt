Sorry everybody for the late notice, but things just fell into place.

Our next meeting will be 2011-02-22 (next Wednesday) at Classic
Graphics. Classic has been kind enough to let us use their big
training/conference room, and parking there is free.

>From i85, take the Harris Blvd. West exit. Turn left on IBM drive.
Classic is about the 2nd or so (I think - Jon, correct me here)
entrance on the right once you're into the complex.

We have a couple of exciting things to talk about, so please make it
if you can, and bring a friend.

 The easiest way to make it into our parking lot is to get in the far 
 right-hand lane as you enter the park. That lane will come to an end and 
 you must turn right. After turning right go forward and you're in 
 Classic's parking lot. Find a spot and make your way to the doors in 
 front of the little visitor parking area with the loop. The doors will 
 be unlocked and we'll probably have some signs up. Will, or Brent, if 
 you have the logo in a high res format I can get it printed on some 
 large stock for the meeting. If you have any trouble finding the place 
 just give me a call 980.216.8588. There will be pizza and drinks on 
 Classic :-).

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Board Member Selection
Message-ID: <CA+rc7MM-19Ut2k7iHeqJun3gE4TNmC-8aM-TQQgQoE2g6wxcJg@mail.gmail.com>

All,

After thinking about the nomination/selection of seven chapter board
members last night (about half of the meeting's attendees), I suggest
that we reduce the number of board members to a reasonable amount
given the relatively small size of our membership. We should define
some board member roles and responsibilities that will best suit our
chapter, and select one board member best suited for each role. As the
chapter's membership and involvement grows, we can add more board
members to these or other roles not yet defined. For now, we should
select from chapter members who feel that they meet one the role
requirements. John Melton and I have come up with the following roles
that we feel would most benefit the chapter.

Roles

Chapter Leader - Jon Molesa. Everybody's happy with this choice and
we're confident that Jon will do a fine job.

Treasurer - This dedicated treasurer would manage the chapter's
finances. The treasurer must be trustworthy (loaded statement) and
should have no professional relationships with any other board members
to avoid conflict of interest. The treasurer does not need security
expertise or industry contacts. The treasurer must be able to manage
budgets and spend wisely.

University Representative - This person should represent the
university and act as a local liaison between the chapter's
professionals and students, as well as between the chapter and the
university. The OWASP Charlotte chapter has a strong student
contingent and we've greatly benefitted from a relationship with the
UNCC College of Computing and Informatics. This board seat is vital to
the chapter. I believe that Dr. Chu is the only logical choice for
this seat.

Professional Representative - This person should have solid expertise
and contacts within the Information Security industry. This person
should also have experience running or participating in OWASP chapters
or functions. This person will serve in the interest of OWASP
Charlotte. It is critical that OWASP Charlotte be free of corporate
control or influence.

Possible Role

Junior/Student Board Member - This person would be a UNCC student and
represent peer students, organize student events, and work with other
board members to provide chapter mentorship or other opportunities for
students.

Anybody interested in being considered for these roles should submit
their names. We can make the final board selection the first order of
business during our next meeting, or we can vote via email, doesn't
matter.

Finally, I'd like to remove my name from consideration for these board
member roles. I have no interest in being the treasurer, I'm not
affiliated with the university, and I simply don't have the industry
contacts that will benefit the chapter. I have strong technological
and information security expertise that I will contribute to the
chapter as a standard member.

Funny, I was just sitting here thinking about the size of the board as
well while I try to get a particular VM to cooperate. I wasn't too happy
with how that went last night. Thanks for the vote of confidence. 
I agree 100% with the below recommendation. In the bee club we call the 
"Professional Representative" is called the Program Chair. We can adopt 
any name we like, the function is the same. Thanks for initiating this. 
Let's get some discussion going, I'm interested in what everyone else's 
thoughts are.

As a side note for irc users there is now an irc channel on freenode
called #owasp-clt. I'm hanging there now.

Wow! My brain went one way on that last one and my fingers went another.
Let me try again. That's what I get for trying to do two things at once.

The three roles make sense to me. Not sure if others are needed or not.
With double the nominations for the positions mentioned here we'll have
to handle it like an election. Self nominations are okay as they were
last night. Of the three available positions mentioned here decide
where you see your self fitting in and we'll select for each
position from the available nominations at the next meeting.

Without some structure like this, what's to stop the board from growing
to include everyone in the club?

However, to be clear, everyone in the club has an equal voice in the
goings on of the club. Anyone may propose a speaker, topic, or project.
These rights are not limited to the board.

Thanks again for the opportunity to serve the club. I will do my best to
fulfil the duties of the position. I'm excited about it and looking
forward to what lies ahead.

Your suggestion is very good for the chapter. Thank you for brining it up. I will be happy to serve as the university representative.

public Google+ Hangout now called owasp-clt:

Currently there's not really any activity, but if you're online, join
