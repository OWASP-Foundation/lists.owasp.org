<PRE>Amended announcement. Will Stranathan will be hosting Tuesday night. please
direct all questions to Will. I am being sent to MA on short notice. I will
have the door on automatic unlock at 6:15 and automatic lock at 7:30. That
should be enough time for everyone that is planning to attend to get inside
the building. You should have no trouble exiting the building as long as
you use the little push bar just below the door handle.

- The OWASP signs are in the closet at the front of the training room

- Coffee maker is in the break room down the hall to the right. Help
yourself please.

- Drinks in the fridge are off limits.

 - Please clean up after yourselves. And someone please take the trash with
you as you leave.

 - I'll wait to hear from you Will, about ordering pizzas. If you want
them, let me know and I'll have some delivered at 6:25 including tip.
Collect each consumers $2-$3.

 - If I have forgotten anything, please let me know. You can reach me via
email or on my cell at 336.844.4177.

Dr Chu will be presenting on &quot;Moving Target Defense Strategies for XSS&quot;.

In looking over the activity on the meetup.com page statistics, i think
it's safe to say that it isn't providing any real benefit to OWASP CLT. We
have picked up a few members because of it, but that's about it. Long term
G+ is a much better fit. Consider this a notice that the meetup.compage/site
thingy will no longer be maintained and will disappear ASAP.

Also, I'm looking for anyone interested in stepping up as the next OWASP
CLT Leader. I believe I've been doing it for roughly 2 years. It's time I
give someone else the opportunity. Come with nominations, self nominated is
okay, Tuesday.
