Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] NC OWASP Chapter April Meeting
Message-ID: <49E3D193.4070007@gmail.com>

Sorry for the late notice on this folks, but our next NC OWASP meeting 
will be on Tuesday April 28th from 6:30-8:30 PM at Coastal Federal 
Credit Union's Headquarters in North Raleigh (address info below).

Myself and Fred Williams just finished up a 2-month series to the local 
ISSA Chapter on the CWE Top 25 list, and we're ready to get back into 
the swing of things with more regularly scheduled OWASP meetings.

This month's meeting will be a review and demonstration of some of the 
more important OWASP tools useful in assessing and securing web based 
applications.

Some of the tools we will be demoing include:
      Webgoat
   Webscarab
   Antisammy
   ESAPI
   and more, time permitting.....

We will be providing beer (until it runs out) so come thirsty!

How do I get there?
Take 440 to the Wake Forest exit #10  (from the inner belt line you will

Where do I park and where do I go once I arrive?
Park anywhere you would like - Coastal Member Only parking just in front
of the building is fine.
We would ask for everybody to come through the main doors in the front of
the building facing the parking lot.
All CFCU doors lock at 7pm. A sentry may be posted at the front door for
only a short time after 7pm.  If you can't get in - call Chris (info

Once inside the building continue straight past the elevators and take the
first left.  The meeting room will be down that hallway, go through the
first set of doors, and take your first right into the meeting room.
