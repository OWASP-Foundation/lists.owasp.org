Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] OWASP CLT Meeting this week
Message-ID: <CAEOipxcqJpyi4RFYmmvqB32X0SQexCK7xTKaeAxrsC4_d6tRag@mail.gmail.com>

If you missed it at the last meetings, we are now meeting on the second
Thursday of each month. Every other detail remains the same.

Igor Matlin will be presenting on Javascript Vulnerabilities

JavaScript controls our lives ? we use it to zoom in and out of a map, to
automatically schedule doctor appointments and to play online games. But
have we ever properly considered the security state of this scripting
language?

Before dismissing the (in)security posture of JavaScript on the grounds of
a client-side problem, consider the impact of JavaScript vulnerability
exploitation to the enterprise: from stealing server-side data to infecting
users with malware. Hackers are beginning to recognize this new playground
and are quickly adding JavaScript exploitation tools to their Web attack
arsenal.

In this talk we explore the vulnerabilities behind JavaScript, including:
?    A new class of vulnerabilities unique only to JavaScript
?    Vulnerabilities in 3rd-party platforms which are exploited through
JavaScript code
?    HTML5 is considered the NG-JavaScript. In turn, HTML5 introduces a new
set of vulnerabilities

Get answer to these situations and more in our upcoming OWASP meeting on
February 12, 2015 with Igor Matlin, Senior Solutions Architect at
Checkmarx. Matthew Rose, Regional Manager of Checkmarx will also be in
attendance.

Things to Know
-    CPE credits will credited for those who possess certifications that
require it.
-    Security food is usually defined as pizza and wings.
-    Please arrive a little early for meet and greet if you can.
-    We are a resource, leverage us a such.
-    Trial and error is how we did it; will give you a head-start. Just
ask.

Tentative Agenda:

6:30 ? 7:00  Meet and Greet
7:00 -  7:15  OWASP Chapter Meeting Announcements
7:15 -  7:30  Fire Talks
7:30 -  8:15  Presentation (Speaker)
8:15 -  8:30  Q & A session

Dear All,

UNC Charlotte student team is qualifying for a national cyber security competition on March 7 (Sat).  We need a judge who is not affiliated with UNC Charlotte to proctor. The role of the judge is to make sure students are cheating. You don't need to prepare for anything. We need to have the judge identified before Monday of next week. 

Can someone please help? I know it is a weekend but it is really important for us. Thanks for your help!

Best,

--Bill

Dear All,

Sorry for the typo. The role of the judge is to make sure that students are NOT cheating. We can have multiple judges that take shifts so that at any given time, someone is in the room. Please let me know if you can volunteer. Thanks!
