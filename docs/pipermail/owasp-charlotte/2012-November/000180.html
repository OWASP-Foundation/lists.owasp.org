<PRE>We're going to try something a little different for our next meeting on 
December 18th 2012. A couple of people at the last meeting asked if we 
were going to cancel it due to it being so close to the holidays. I 
hadn't really thought about it, but with some of you being students and 
all you could be out of town spending time with families. The idea of 
holding one of our meetings over google hangouts has been brought up a 
couple of times and I even have a couple offers from people interested 
in presenting remotely to do so on GH. Will used to have a named hangout 
back when Google still allowed you to named hangouts. This isn't the 
case any more, as far as I can tell. As it stands right now Will and I 
are going to discuss and share PHP static code analysis tools. Anyone 
else that has something they want to share or delve into can if time 
permits and there's enough interest. Until then I'll be digging into 
<A HREF="http://phpmd.org.">http://phpmd.org.</A> I'm going to run it against a default Drupal download 
and see what it turns up. Please pass this along to anyone who you think 
would enjoy this. I'm planning on being present at our regular place at 
the regular time. It will just be easier for me, from a distraction 
point of view, to do it there. You're more than welcome to come out and 
join me. One cool feature of GH is the live streaming option. It will be 
broadcast to my youtube page at <A HREF="http://youtube.com/rjmolesa.">http://youtube.com/rjmolesa.</A> Even if you 
don't want to participate but don't want to miss anything you can check 
out the live stream.
