<PRE>One of the important functions of a local chapter is to be involved in
giving stuff back to OWASP. Yes - we should all listen and learn from
industry experts, be consumers of some of the great OWASP tools and
documentation available, but we should also be producers.

If you were to search on Google for &quot;REST security&quot; the very first thing
that comes up is a cheatsheet on the OWASP site (and this is how it should
be). However, this document still says it's in DRAFT. A couple of leaders
have decided to look at it and see if it can be pushed over the hill, but
there's still an opportunity there.

Somewhat-related - I'm looking around to see if there's like an &quot;OWASP Help
Wanted&quot; sign or anything where project leaders have a pretty well-defined
understanding of what needs to be done, but no people to do it. If there
are any things like that out there, I'll see if anybody here wants to help.

Also, don't forget to RSVP on the meetup for the December meeting by Google
Hangout. Jon is going to talk a bit about PHPMD, and I'll be doing a quick
demo of some of the really cool features of PMD (different project, similar
letters).
