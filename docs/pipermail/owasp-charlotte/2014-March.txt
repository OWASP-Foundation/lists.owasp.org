Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] No Meeting Tonight
Message-ID: <CAEOipxfrqB_ng70VpTZB8WsOtHT4d2XugjLU1-_r8d1GZ5RyxQ@mail.gmail.com>

I had sent you this message earlier, or at least I thought I did. Turns out
I sent it to the OWASP Leaders list instead. I am just now discovering my
mistake.

Original Message:

I'm sorry to say that there is no meeting tonight. Arrangements for a
topic/speaker fell through at the last minute. See you next month.

End...

I hope not too many of you came out.
