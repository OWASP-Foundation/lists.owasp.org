I am sorry for the short notice. I snuck up on me too. Tomorrow night at
6:30PM is our next meeting. Will Stranathan and I will be covering "Chrome
Packaged Apps" in details. Unlike Chrome Extensions and Chrome Apps. Chrome
Packaged Apps are true desktop applications designed to operate offline by
default. If you have a chrome book or want to target it's users as well as
users of Google Chrome, come on out. Bring your laptop, as there will be a
demo that you can follow along with.

I hope to see you tomorrow night.

Hey,

Just letting you know that there is a free beta exam for Mobile App 
Security+

*When:* Available now
*Where:* Pearson VUE testing centers
*Beta exam number:*
iOS Edition: IO1-001
Android Edition:AD1-001
*Cost:* Free
*Promo Code:*
iOS Edition: MAPS iOS EB beta
Android Edition: MAPS ADR EB beta
(utilize when registering for the exam to receive it for free)


I just registered for the Android one later next month. There is little 
to no training material, so we will see how it goes. If any one else has 
taken it or is interested, let me know maybe we could study the 
objectives or something.

Sign up now, because they said it was limited to 150 people, but I find 
that hard to believe.


Owen.
