<PRE>I wanted to let you know the current status of things concerning OWASP
Charlotte. My previous employer, Classic Graphics, continues to be an
awesome company to work for and with. They have agreed to continue to
host our monthly meeting, with free parking, and cover the costs of the
meetup.com site. For the most part things will largely stay the same for
the foreseeable future. This is good news for you and me.

Plans to line up a speaker fell through for January but I'm open to
having a meeting if there are things you want to discuss or just get
together and drink some beers (or cola, or coffee, or water ever) ;).

I'm still kicking around the idea of Saturday meetups that are more
workshopy in nature. Your ideas are welcome as always. I am also still
soliciting possible alternate locations for meetups to make it easier
for others to attend that find it difficult to get to the University area.

Also, if you know of anyone looking for a new job or a start in InfoSec
with a smallish company, great people, awesome atmosphere, please put me
in contact with them. I have been asked to help locate my replacement.
I'd prefer to recommend someone I know or know of that comes through
recommendation as well. Even if it is someone looking to get started.
I'd love to talk with them.

Next Tuesday's meeting is up in the air. With the speaker line up not
working out, the holidays, and job changes I have had my plate full. Let
me know what you'd like to do.

</PRE>
