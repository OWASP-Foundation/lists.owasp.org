All,
Sorry for the delay in getting this typed up, but here are a few of my ideas
for how and where appsensor could be improved. I've tried to break them down
just a bit into categories in case folks have a preference. There are
definitely many, many more things that could be done, but hopefully these
will get the ball rolling. If you're interested in tackling any of these,
let me know and I'll get you setup.

Documentation
------------------------
- how to integrate appsensor into an application
- update wiki pages
- write getting started / how-to guides for users
- writeup faq for wiki based on mailing list discussions / bug list
- map detection points to modsecurity ruleset using those detection points
(cross-reference)
- think up new detection points and document them
- think up new response actions and document them

Coding
------------------------
- build appsensor in other languages (we discussed php)
- write more detection points into sample app / core code / new sample apps
- write more response actions into sample app / core code / new sample apps
- write more sample apps
- expand existing sample app (AppSensorDemo2)
- build out intrusion detector that communicates w/ an SIEM
- build trend analysis engine
- write different implementations of the existing interfaces (datastores for
different databases like oracle/mysql/etc., user implementation for
jsecurity/spring security/etc.)

Testing
------------------------
- write unit / integration tests
- build functional test cases for sample app(s)
- build new sample apps that use appsensor and find what breaks
- load test appsensor core code

Thanks,
John

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Responsible Use
Message-ID: <EA18DED3-3C8F-4293-87E0-663713FA78D7@thestranathans.com>

Over the past year or so, folks have either posted vetted job leads directly to the list or asked me if posting those to the list is allowed.  We don't have an official stance on it, and as far as I can tell, OWASP in-general doesn't have an *official* stance on the matter.

I personally feel that it can be good because:
* It's a slow economy, and if this list can be of some genuine help to somebody, that makes me happy
* This is a professional organization - and part of the goal (as far as I know) of professional organizations is networking
* Folks on the list are by and large pretty responsible and we're able to police ourselves
sim
However, it does seem like the very sort of thing which might get out of hand pretty quickly.  If we're posting job leads, why not product advertisement?  (OWASP does not specifically endorse *any* commercial product - should the chapter mailing lists not also abide by that?)

So to that end, since it's come up more than once, I figure I'd share a couple of resources that *are* OWASP-endorsed.

1) https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Jobs is a listing of jobs available in the appsec realm.  There's a link on there that says "contact us" if your organization is hiring and want to use that page as a means to get the word out.
2) There's a GLOBAL - Open Web Application Security (OWASP) group on LinkedIn - just search for OWASP
3) There's now an OWASP Charlotte group on LinkedIn.  If you're interested in sharing a job lead in the appsec field there, there's a Jobs section specifically for it.

So we're not going to start moderating the mailing list or anything.  But there are also those other means of letting others know about potential openings.  But if you've got a genuine lead and post it to the mailing list, I think we're all pretty responsible and can make mail filters or simply disregard the messages that don't interest us.

I'll probably start working on some of the unit tests.  Will have to do some learning to work on integration tests.

Since it's already in Central, any thoughts of making an archetype that already has AppSensor dropped in?  (Kinda' makes me wish you could have "multiple inheritance" archetypes where you could say "make this a Struts 2/ESAPI/AppSensor project").

Will,
That's a great idea I hadn't thought of at all, but would be a welcome
addition. There's definitely room for an ESAPI archetype (that could be
contributed to that project), and at least 2 for appsensor. one that uses
ESAPI as the authn mechanism, and one that uses some other mechanism.

All,
Just wanted to pass along this article that recently was published in
CrossTalk (a software engineering mag for the govt.). It's about appsensor -
hope you find the background helpful.
Thanks,
John

Michael Coates, John Melton, Dennis Groves and I wrote an article
about OWASP AppSensor for CrossTalk, the Journal of Defense Software
Engineering, which has now been published in the September/October
issue.  This edition has the theme Protecting Against Predatory
Practices.

  Creating Attack-Aware Software Applications with Real-Time Defenses

  Full edition listing
  http://www.crosstalkonline.org/issues/septoct-2011.html

We hope this will help to raise awareness and solicit further help
with the project.

I will try to get some printed copies and bring them along to the
AppSensor Summit next week in Minneapolis at AppSec USA 2011:

All,
I know this is still a few weeks away, but I HIGHLY recommend you come out
to see Jeff speak. He's a very smart, helpful guy. Whatever he presents,
you'll benefit from - and you get to chat with him in person. Like Will
mentioned, bring some friends too.
Thanks,
John
