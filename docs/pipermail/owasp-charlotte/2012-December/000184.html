<PRE>Just wanted to remind everybody once again of the Google+ meetup on
December 18. The event page is at
<A HREF="https://plus.google.com/events/cs85uhf0msuaajuqakekaucg0dk">https://plus.google.com/events/cs85uhf0msuaajuqakekaucg0dk</A> . If you can't
get to the event page, let me know and I'll shoot you an invite directly.
Keep an eye on the event page just before 6:30 - Jon will be posting the
URL for the Hangout there.

Jon is going to be talking about PHP static analysis with PHPMD. He's going
to have run PHPMD against some Drupal code and maybe some other stuff to
see what all it comes up with and what the results are like. PHP static
analysis was an area of great discussion at our last meeting, and I'm
really looking forward to seeing what this comes up with.

In addition to Jon covering PHPMD, I'll be covering some of the uber-slick
features of PMD. I've been toying with it for a little while now trying to
find simpler-to-find issues, and it's really amazing how powerful it really
is. My initial interest was from the presentation I did a couple of months
ago on finding things the tools don't already know how to find, but I'm
finding that you can do even more powerful things than I initially had
tested - and it's got additional tools that make developing those rules
very easy - you won't want to miss that part of it.
