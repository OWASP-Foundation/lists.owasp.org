Tonight Adam Byers will be joining us to demo his project RARW (Rapid
Assessment of Web Resources). RARW is an opensource project available at
https://bitbucket.org/al14s/rawr/wiki/Home. RAWR is useful in identifying
resources during a web app pentest. I'm looking forward to seeing you there
tonight.

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Monthly Google Hangouts
Message-ID: <CAEOipxdFhX_9D5s-kLQuwSw=mXd0MvL8+NVp8m_+4k5EEZF19g@mail.gmail.com>

I'm interested in running an experiment. I would like to have a scheduled
monthly meeting via Google's Hangouts only. I'm proposing the third Tuesday
of each month starting at 7:00 PM. There are a lot of great features in
Hangouts and I personally like them a lot. If we do them as a Hangout on
Air there is now a new "Ask a question" button that allows viewers only to
ask questions while the HOA is in progress.

Consider this the one and only notice of such meetings. If you're
interested in participating in any way make sure you join OWASP CLT's
Google+ Community found here
https://plus.google.com/communities/107822512199764250166 as all meeting
notices and details will be posted there. Add it to your calendar. Set
reminders. Do what you need to do to keep up with it.

If there is someone or a topic that you would like to see presented in a
HOA please make a suggestion in the Discussion area of the community.
