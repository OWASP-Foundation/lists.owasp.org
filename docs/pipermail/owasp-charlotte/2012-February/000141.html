<PRE>All,

After thinking about the nomination/selection of seven chapter board
members last night (about half of the meeting's attendees), I suggest
that we reduce the number of board members to a reasonable amount
given the relatively small size of our membership. We should define
some board member roles and responsibilities that will best suit our
chapter, and select one board member best suited for each role. As the
chapter's membership and involvement grows, we can add more board
members to these or other roles not yet defined. For now, we should
select from chapter members who feel that they meet one the role
requirements. John Melton and I have come up with the following roles
that we feel would most benefit the chapter.

Roles

Chapter Leader - Jon Molesa. Everybody's happy with this choice and
we're confident that Jon will do a fine job.

Treasurer - This dedicated treasurer would manage the chapter's
finances. The treasurer must be trustworthy (loaded statement) and
should have no professional relationships with any other board members
to avoid conflict of interest. The treasurer does not need security
expertise or industry contacts. The treasurer must be able to manage
budgets and spend wisely.

University Representative - This person should represent the
university and act as a local liaison between the chapter's
professionals and students, as well as between the chapter and the
university. The OWASP Charlotte chapter has a strong student
contingent and we've greatly benefitted from a relationship with the
UNCC College of Computing and Informatics. This board seat is vital to
the chapter. I believe that Dr. Chu is the only logical choice for
this seat.

Professional Representative - This person should have solid expertise
and contacts within the Information Security industry. This person
should also have experience running or participating in OWASP chapters
or functions. This person will serve in the interest of OWASP
Charlotte. It is critical that OWASP Charlotte be free of corporate
control or influence.

Possible Role

Junior/Student Board Member - This person would be a UNCC student and
represent peer students, organize student events, and work with other
board members to provide chapter mentorship or other opportunities for
students.

Anybody interested in being considered for these roles should submit
their names. We can make the final board selection the first order of
business during our next meeting, or we can vote via email, doesn't
matter.

Finally, I'd like to remove my name from consideration for these board
member roles. I have no interest in being the treasurer, I'm not
affiliated with the university, and I simply don't have the industry
contacts that will benefit the chapter. I have strong technological
and information security expertise that I will contribute to the
chapter as a standard member.

- Jay Reynolds
