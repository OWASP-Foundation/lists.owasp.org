Sounds like a great (and timely) topic.  Isn't Bank of America doing just 
this for online banking customers?  Is he willing to share his presentation 
with the rest of us?

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Our next OWASP meeting is this coming Monday at 6pm. We'll have Michael 
&gt; Starks presenting.
&gt;
&gt; Title: Bringing two-factor authentication to web applications.
&gt;
&gt; Synopsis: Web applications which authorize a user with only a password are 
&gt; subject to a number of password-related exposures and vulnerabilities. 
&gt; Passwords can be difficult to remember, easy to guess, easy to steal, and 
&gt; are often shared.  Implementing two-factor authentication into your web 
&gt; application can lead to a much higher level of security.  This 
&gt; presentation will introduce some of the technologies to achieve that goal. 
&gt; It will discuss the costs and benefits of these technologies and how to 
&gt; get started.
&gt;
&gt; Bio: Michael Starks is a Security Administrator for a local healthcare 
&gt; organization.  His routine responsibilities include firewall 
&gt; administration, intrusion detection, systems configuration and hardening, 
&gt; and administering overall security policy.  He is also a certified 
&gt; computer repair technician and owner of a local computer services company. 
&gt; In Michael's spare time, he enjoys exploring open-source technologies, 
&gt; experimenting with renewable energy projects, and listening to blues 
&gt; music.
&gt;
&gt; I look forward to the presentation and hope to see you at Bryant &amp; 
&gt; Stratton Professional Skills Center!  Location info is below:
&gt;
&gt; It's in Henrietta on Jefferson Road.  It's in the plaza behind Bill Grays 
&gt; and Tulleys near the Post Office.  Enter the PSC (Professional Skills 
&gt; Center) door which is left of the main entrance door. We'll be in 
&gt; Conference Rm 1 which after you enter is in the office area immediately to 
&gt; your right.
&gt;
&gt; Bryant &amp; Stratton Professional Skills Center
&gt; 1225 Jefferson Rd.
&gt; Rochester, NY 14623
&gt; Phone: 585-292-5627
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, let me know if you have any suggestions or questions or would like 
&gt; to present at a future meeting.
