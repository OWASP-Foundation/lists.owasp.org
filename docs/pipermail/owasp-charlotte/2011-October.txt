Where: UNC-Charlotte Campus, Woodward Hall room 130
Who: Jeff Williams, CEO Aspect Security and Chairperson OWASP, and YOU
Why: Jeff Williams, CEO Aspect Security and Chairperson OWASP will be there to talk

Jeff Williams (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Jeff_Williams) CEO of Aspect Security and Chairperson of OWASP will be speaking on Monday night.  He's going to do a rapid-fire talk on lots and lots of different topics.

He's even said he'll take recommendations from the chapter on what to talk about.  So your homework between now and tomorrow evening is to come up with interesting things you'd like to hear Jeff talk about.

Remember, the meeting is Monday night (yes - the night BEFORE the UNCC Cyber Security Symposium) at 6:30 in room 130 of Woodward Hall.  I'm not positive if there are classes that day or not, so I'm not certain what the parking situation will be.  If you want to ride-share with somebody into the campus to save the parking fare, please let the list know in advance so we can coordinate those rides.

All,

UNCC is on Fall Break today.  I am not certain if that means anything for
the cost, but there will be ample parking.

Ah right! I think the way it'll work is that you park as usual, but tickets won't be checked or the exit gates will just be open.

Hey Will

I'm coming down to hear the talk tonight - first time visit to Charlotte 
QWASP. 

It maybe too late for this but a few topics I have:

What's going on with static code scanning? Is it going to become more of 
the norm?
How are apps hosted in the cloud being scanned - especially when 
dev/qa/integration all in the cloud also?
There seems to  be several projects out there developing frameworks for 
secure coding. Do you know if your customers use any of them? Do they 
work?


Thanks,

Will there be free pizza this time? I'm going to attend regardless,
but I'd like to know if I'll get free food out of the deal.

Heh.  The phenomenal speaker is about all we're getting for free this time.  I was hoping the pizza place was going to give me a group discount last time so I could give them a shameless plug - but no dice.

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Moxie Marlinspike SSL / Authenticity talk
Message-ID: <CAM8z=yKkeYmTnhg8Gu8PYxT7HJaxNiaesi=hwVsmPvyYWS47bA@mail.gmail.com>

All,
Some folks at OWASP suggested it might be a good idea if we pass this around
to our chapters. Below are links to the same presentation given at 2
different venues by Moxie Marlinspike, a very smart guy who does lots of
things, one of which is research into SSL. The talk is about what he
perceives as brokenness in SSL as it's currently implemented (specifically
related to the CA portion of the equation). It's a VERY good talk. I
wouldn't often recommend spending ~45 minutes listening to a recorded talk,
but I will for this one. He's also got a firefox plugin that implements his
suggested corrections to the system (convergence.io). OWASP is planning to
startup a convergence notary to help the project along, and that's what
spawned the conversation.

If anyone has any questions, voice them to the list or me privately. If
there's interest, this could be a topic we could touch on at the next
meetup.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Wl2FW2TcA (recorded for blackhat - better
quality, but no image of Moxie)
http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/17457016 (recorded for OWASP appsecusa -
shows both Moxie speaking and the slides, but a lot of background noise)

Thanks,
John

Message-ID: <CAM8z=yKm136qDqWk5HA_Qqn54ZspEBq9tWg+_9PwRq0qR697tQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,
We had a brief conversation the other day at the cyber security symposium
(good to see some of you there) about marketing / advertising / planning for
our meetings. It would be great if we had some people who are good at that
and/or willing to try to help us out in that capacity. Charlotte is a big
town and has lots of people that are (or at least should be) interested in
security. We need to figure out a way to get in touch with them and get them
involved. Also, if you have ideas, but can't help plan for some reason, let
us know (or me privately) your ideas for reaching out to the community. Jeff
said the New York OWASP chapter has ~200 people at their meetings every
month. We may not get there this month or even year, but we have something
to strive towards. There are easily thousands of developers/business
folks/security people in Charlotte that are interested in security. We just
have to find them and get the word out!

Thanks,
John

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Quick Wins
Message-ID: <1E982607-BBE3-44A7-9329-0D6600F6752F@thestranathans.com>

One of the things Jeff had talked about on Monday night was getting some "quick wins" to start getting the chapter some momentum - just quick things that need to be done that aren't a tremendous amount of effort.

Here are some ideas we could do for quick wins.
* Creating a maven archetype for a project with Appsensor already built-in and configured
* Documentation/tutorials for Appsensor
* HTML5 browser compatibility tests

With regards to the last one, I'd like to do that sometime in November - specifically as it relates to some things on the HTML 5 cheatsheet (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTML5_Security_Cheat_Sheet).

Does anybody have any other ideas for quick (< 4 hours) wins?  I'd like to set these up for a couple of hours in the evenings over coffee or something.

Thoughts?

I approve this message!

When we originally booted up, Mark worked on a canned presentation that folks could give at InfraGard, Charlotte ISSA, PHP User Group, Hackerspace Charlotte, 2600, etc.  That presentation is available at https://www.owasp.org/images/d/db/Charlotte_OWASP_Presentation_Template.ppt .  I may brush that up a little bit to specifically mention AppSensor and ASIDE and maybe a couple of other items.

Does anybody have inroads into any of those above groups?  I might have some limited inroads into a couple, but I think some other folks are more connected into some of those things.

Glad you asked ... I do :>. Secure code snippets to "solve" the OWASP Top 10
in different languages / frameworks. I'm thinking we could build something
so a developer can go through the flow below.
1. Choose Top 10 issue -> CSRF
2. Choose language -> Java
3. Choose framework -> Struts2
4. Get secure code snippets / documentation telling you how to resolve.

This could add so much to the OWASP ecosystem and get us a lot of visibility
if we do it right, much like your HTML5 cheatsheet idea below. We could go
through each one and build something like Java/.NET/PHP solutions for each
one, and then expand from there to cover more frameworks/languages.

Thanks,
John

Getting time at some professional organizations can be a little tough if you
don't know the right people.  In addition to the presentation, which would
be fantastic if you can get the air time, should we come up with some flyers
that we could leaving laying around for people to pick up?  Additionally
should we come up with a canned advertisement we can leave at various App
Dev forums, I know there are some extremely active forums that have local
discussion groups, we could let people know we exist there?

I am a member of the Enterprise Developers Guild (
http://www.developersguild.org) here in Charlotte and I can see if we can
get on their agenda for next year.  It's a .NET developers group that has
meetings on every 4th Tuesday of the month as well as various Code Camps
that they run on the weekends.  They don't normally have application
security topics so it would be a good venue for introducing our group and
what OWASP can offer (e.g. - ESAPI).

With that said, I would like to introduce myself to the group.  My name is
Tim Leedy and have been a developer for around a decade and have been a
security professional since 2001.  I am excited about working with this
group and look forward to getting back into Application Security as I have
been away from the field for a few years.

Regards,
Tim Leedy

Hi Everyone,

If we're talking about quick wins (< 4 hours), the HTML5 browser
compatibility tests, AppSensor documentation, and a Maven archetype
are great ideas. Creating a useful documentation stack may not be as
quick a win, but a big win just the same. We can chunk the tasks and
get started with the most popular technologies, frameworks, and
vulnerabilities. The documentation can provide code examples and some
suggestions (e.g. where to place AppSensor detection points). Maybe we
generate procedures that can also double as sources for technology
stories in an Agile methodology (e.g. every-sprint requirements in
SDL-Agile)? This could help us promote security in the development
life-cycle by suggesting what should be done, where, and when it
should be done.

Will, I think November would be good. I'd like to participate in a
couple of these working groups/meetups before the end of the year, if
possible.

Jay

I don't have any real inroads to Hackerspace Charlotte, but I've been
to a few of their meetings and they're a welcoming and interesting
bunch of smart folks. I know at least a few of them are security
professionals. They recently hosted a presentation on rainbow tables,
and they host programming nights. I imagine they'd be open to other
presentations, and perhaps some will attend the OWASP meetings. I've
seen a couple of the UNCC students at Hackerspace Charlotte and OWASP
meetings. One kid is evidently a Dry Ice Jenga champion and a
lock-picking master. Maybe some of these students who do have strong
connections to Hackerspace can extend invitations to our next OWASP
meeting.

One of my colleagues is one of the original founders. I'm sure they're quite willing to participate if offer is extended. I'll reach out to him.

Hey,

I've been around HackerSpace Charlotte from that start, but not actively 
involved at the moment.
I just talked to one of the active members and he said they'd welcome a 
collaboration with the OWASP group and would love to have a presentation 
one night. I invited him to this list, and I think they're going to 
bring it up at one of their meetings.
