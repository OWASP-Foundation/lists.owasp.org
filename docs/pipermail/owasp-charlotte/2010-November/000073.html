<PRE>Hi everybody--

My name is Mike Parsons.  I've been in Information Security for over 15
years and in Information Technology over 30 years.  I actually put the first
firewall in at Wachovia (the original one) and was the security engineer
responsible for implementation of Wachovia's first on-line banking and
on-line brokerage products.

I took a number of courses toward my PhD in Information Security and Privacy
in the 2001-2005 timeframe at UNC Charlotte but was pressured to drop out by
my employer at the time.  I did complete requirements for a graduate
certificate in Information Security and Privacy to complement an MBA I
earned some time ago from the University of Maryland.

I was reintroduced to modern web application security during a stint at
Breach Security where I was the channel systems engineer for their WebDefend
product and still do a little work with the product.

I just took a position leading the information security effort at a
community bank north of Charlotte and want to keep abreast of developments
in the web security space.  I look forward to participating in the efforts
of the Charlotte Chapter of OWASP.

I also maintain an active membership in Infragard, ISSA and ISACA and have
presented at several local events.

Kindest regards.

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Introduce Yourself

Since the chapter is getting back together after a long-ish hiatus, it's
probably a good idea for those on the mailing list to briefly introduce
themselves.  Nothing terribly intimidating.  Maybe:

Your name
What you do relative to Web Application Security
What you hope to get out of the local chapter

I'll get us started....

I'm Will Stranathan.  I used to be an application pen tester, but more
recently do security code review of applications and help with many facets
of web application security (some pen test subject help, architecture
review, help developers make static analysis part of their SDLC, training,
etc.).  My only qualification, really, is that I've been writing rotten code
since the days of the Commodore 64.  Out of the local chapter, I hope to
develop some more professional relationships with local experts, and hope to
get to work on some exciting projects with OWASP.

Now it's your turn.

Will Stranathan
