<PRE>I thought I'd start a message thread regarding risk rating on  
apparent input validation errors that an application doesn't filter  
and yet doesn't appear to be (or just isn't) susceptible to from an  
injection perspective.  For example, a web application whose form  
fields and POST method will allow any number of special characters  
such as: *, ', %, !,|, \x,... and these characters are just accepted  
by the application and stored in the backend rdbms.  For instance,  
the user's name might appear now as: &quot;Name= '1=1 OR SELECT * FROM  
DICT&quot; and &quot;Street Address = %2a%20&quot;, etc.  Because the application  
uses java.sql.PreparedStatements or rdbms StoredProcedures, the data  
is passed as precompiled binary or parametric data before it reaches  
the rdbms and is therefore not interpreted as a normal SQL string  
would be, essentially rendering the site immune, to some degree, from  
these types of data and command injections.

That's not to say it's a no-risk scenario.  There is still a  
vulnerability that would only be realized when the records are  
read... imagine a &quot;Name=&lt;script language=javascript&gt;alert 
(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;&quot; which was stored on the backend, and  
everytime some one views this record their session mgmt token is  
displayed as a popup, or another example, a similar string is pushed  
into an internal logging mechanism like Log4J/NET using a similar  
technique that will now display the admin's session credential when  
she reviews the log files for the previous business day (heh,  
assuming this ever happens in the real world).  One could redirect  
this information from the DOM to another site where the credentials  
could be harvested (but only if the field length was sufficiently  
long to allow for this).

I've always considered this type of vulnerability as low, and would  
be curious as to how you guys would think about it.
