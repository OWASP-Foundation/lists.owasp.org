First of all, congrats to Jon!

If this doesn't go to every ones spam box I was wondering if there is a 
meeting tonight. I have a roof guy coming over at some point because my 
3 year old roof started leaking, but if he shows up early, I can come 
and maybe talk about a project I think is pretty cool.


Owen.

become an ethical hacker and is looking for stories and advice. So please
