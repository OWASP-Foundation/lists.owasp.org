<PRE>I wasn't looking for anything specific.  I was working with an open-source developer, telling him things that were wrong with his code, and he was very interested in learning about the things we do without having to spend a lot of money to go through a good training program.  I suppose I learned by experience, rather than by a program, but I had time as an apprentice to learn.

&gt;<i> Will, 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the &quot;training&quot; at OWASP is pretty weak so far, but Sandra Paiva is working on some of that as I understand it.  I think the appsec tutorial series is a &quot;dip a toe in the water&quot; effort, and will be a decent introduction to basic concepts, but won't get you very far.  I also think that SANS has a couple language-specific courses in this space, at least I remember a Java one.  I believe Frank Kim (from thinksec) teaches that one.  Also, Jim Manico (project lead for ESAPI) does training as well.  Not sure what your exact needs are, but those are a couple options.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From another project I'm working on, I was asked if there is any *good* defensive programming training.  I wasn't aware of anything, and one person had mentioned an OWASP project working toward making some SCORM-compatible content but free.  I haven't found that yet, but I did stumble upon this:  <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Appsec_Tutorial_Series.">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Appsec_Tutorial_Series.</A>  The first video is available on line, and it's pretty high quality.  I don't necessarily agree with all the presentation, but it's a pretty good thing to show coders who aren't familiar with application security.

</I>&gt;<i> Anybody aware of anything else?  Is that something worth getting plugged into?
