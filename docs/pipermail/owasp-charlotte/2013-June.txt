This is my third attempt to send this. I've been told a few times it isn't
coming through.

I'm expecting a baby any day now. We have a big audit next week at work.
And BSides was this weekend. I just can't muster the energy nor guarantee
that I will  be available Tuesday. Any takers on running the show?

I figure since it's summer time, we'd be low on attendance anyway. Might be
a good one to cancel. Would love to get together with some folks for an
occasional code jam or something, though.
