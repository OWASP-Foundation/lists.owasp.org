<PRE>First of all I wanted to share some news. After 7 years with Classic
Graphics, I have accepted a full-time position with Lowe's on their
pen-testing team. I will start on January 12th. Though I haven't brought it
up for discussion with my current employer, I believe that it is safe to
assume that they will no longer sponsor a meeting space or the meetup.com
fees.

As far as the meeting space goes, I've discussed it with Dr. Chu already
and we can still hold the meetings at UNCC. Which is nice. Nothing is set
in stone at this point, so if there are other options for a meeting space
let's discuss it here on the mailing list.

Now for the meetup.com discussion. Again, I haven't discussed this with
Classic Graphics, but I believe that it's a safe assumption that they will
no longer cover those fees. A meetup.com group runs $70/quarter or $280/yr.
We have $878 in our chapter bucket at the parent org. Almost 100% of the
new members that we've gained and continue to gain find us on Meetup. It is
the first place people go when looking for local meetings. OTOH, that is
about the only value it provides. We don't make full use of the site or
it's tools as part of our typical workflow.

In a few minutes I will send out 3 separate emails with a specific topic in
the subject line. I would appreciate you sharing your thoughts and two cent
on the following email and not this one.

Thanks.
