It seems like the CLT chapter has become inactive. Is there still interest
in maintaining a local chapter?

That is a good question.  To be active we need a vision or a goal to  
achieve together.  There are a lot of open projects at OWASP (not  
including the ones I'm working on).  Would folks like to take on one  
of the projects to collectively work on as a chapter?

Some ideas based on our membership:

-J2EE Security Standards and Whitepapers
-Code Review Standards and Whitepapers
-WebScarab (needs some major work to bring it back up to speed)

If anyone knows of a meeting space we could use that is convenient  
for most please post it and we'll get a meeting together.  I'll call  
around too.

GOAT BANK!  GOAT BANK!  GOAT BANK!  GOAT BANK!

Since out chapter is so strong in development experience, I'd LOVE to
see us release some whitepapers on solving common problems.  i.e., you
know people still make money on application firewalls?  And they
somehow can still convince developers that < is a "malicious
character"?!  But they don't do anything about URL's with things like
?id=385729 .

Well, okay then...  how about we divide and conquer.  Since GoatBank  
is going to essentially be a reference architecture for securing web  
apps with J2EE, how about some volunteers to draft a J2EE security  
guideline (similar to the one I worked on a few years ago with the  
other OWASP old timers - how to build secure web apps, etc) and then  
after exposing all the holes with the default-build == insecure- 
design paradigm we can show in the code how to remediate all the  
vulns.  Any volunteers to start working on the parallel effort of  
developing the guide?

In light of the recent OWASP Coding initiative, I propose that we adopt one
or two of the projects listed there. On the plus side, we could use the
funds to perhaps fund a UNCC student to work on other web sec. projects.

With regards to meeting spaces, there are several coffee shops with wifi and
psuedo meeting areas around the Uptown area. Two that immediately come to
mind are Noda's Bakery shop at the corner of Central Ave. & Pecan and SK
Netcafe (http://www.sknetcafe.com/). Also, there's the LAN center out by the
University area.

As a last resort, I can offer up my house if folks don't mind meeting in a
very spartan environment :)
