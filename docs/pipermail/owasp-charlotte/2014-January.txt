Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] CPE Credits

If you gave me your name and ISC^2 number at the last meeting, you *should*
see the CPE credits on your account now.

As a reminder, OWASP Chapter meetings are worth valuable CPE credits, and
we're now able to submit those CPE credits to ISC^2 on your behalf so that
you don't have to remember to submit them, and since we submit proof of
attendance and an overview of the presentation, you shouldn't be audited on
those. Just be sure to have your ISC^2 certification number when you attend
the meeting and we'll submit those for you.

Thanks,
Will

Just confirming - the CPEs showed up in my listing at (ISC)2. ?That makes it really convenient and audit free. ?Thanks!

Mark
