We are looking for at least 2 volunteers to staff the OWASP Foundation booth at the Techno Security & Forensics Investigations Conference happening in Myrtle Beach at the Myrtle beach Marriott Resort May 31 - June 3 (yes all 4 days). They are expecting 1000+ in attendance.  

The volunteers would have full conference passes and could take shifts at working the booth. 

If you are interested and available to commit, please contact me for additional details.
