Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Monday August 15 Meeting
Message-ID: <78F2FCEE-565D-48C4-A830-07364F5106ED@thestranathans.com>

Gang:

Our next meeting will be Monday, August 15 at 6:30PM somewhere at UNCC - more details on where to follow later.  But during that time, UNCC will not be checking parking stickers, so that means FREE PARKING for the August 15 meeting.

Our presenter for the meeting will be John Melton who will talk about the AppSensor project on OWASP - a webapp instrumentation framework for real-time defense and analytics.  Really cool stuff, and promises to be a fun ride.

Talk it up here - will you be there?  Need a ride?  Need directions?

I already did a similar presentation (a shorter version) at the symposium.
Feel free to let me know either on or off list if you'd like something
specific covered and I'll try to work it in. Will, any idea if there will be
a whiteboard in our meeting room?
Thanks,
John

If that doesn't get your attention....

The Monday, August 15 meeting will be at 6:30 in Woodward Hall room 130 at UNCC.  Remember, parking that week at UNCC is FREE, and I'll pick up pizza on the way to the meeting.  Yes - that's FREE parking, FREE food, AND as if that wasn't enough...

John Melton will be doing a presentation on the OWASP AppSensor project, including possibly information on how YOU can get involved.

Free parking, free food, killer presentation - what more could you ask for?

If you could, please do me the favor of letting me know if you plan on coming so I know (approximately) how much pizza to get.  I'll probably get enough for a couple extra people, but if you plan on coming, please let me know.
