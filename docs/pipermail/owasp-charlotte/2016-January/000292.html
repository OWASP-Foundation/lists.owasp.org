<PRE>Hey everybody,

I'm Alan Chavez, and from here on out I'll be helping with the logistics of
this group. I'm an Skookum employee, and Infosec enthusiast, and I'm really
excited to be part of this community.

Skookum is very excited to host the meetup, Skookum's address is:

201 S Tryon St. Floor 15.

We are in the same building where Dean and Deluca, and Vapiano are. Once
you arrive to Floor 15, the glass door should be unlocked, if it isn't feel
free to text/call me at: 980-365-1473.

As far as parking goes, this is something I'm working on to see if I can
get some free passes, or at least a discounted rate. Unfortunately, for
tonight's meetup it won't be possible.

All the parking decks around here have discounted rates after 6:00 PM, and
the cost oscillates between 4 and 5 for your entire stay. The closest
parking deck to the office is the BB&amp;T parking garage. The entrance to this
garage is on 4th Street, right before N College St. If you are driving on
4th street, the entrance will be to your left, and it's a tunnel that goes
underground.

Parking on 4th and 3rd Street is free after 5PM.

If you need additional options, here's a map along with prices:

Personally, I like to park in a garage that is right across the ball park,
in the corner of Mint and 4th. I believe the discounted rate of that
parking lot is $4 for 12 hours.

Once again, if you have any questions or troubles to get here. Feel free to
give me a call: 980 365 1473.

Skookum address: 201 S Tryon St. Floor 15.

Same building as Vapianos and Dean and Deluca.

Best,
Alan Chavez
