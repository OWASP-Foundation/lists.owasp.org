<PRE>Greeting folks,

Our next meeting is tomorrow night. We officially begin at 7:00 PM in
the training room of Classic Graphics.	But we'll open the doors for
meet and greet at 6:30. Someone from the UNCC 49er Security Division is
coming to talk to us about their recent competition in <A HREF="http://neccdc.org/.">http://neccdc.org/.</A> 

Also, if there is time I'd like to open the floor to you. If you have a
topic or presentation that you think would be interesting to everyone
and can cover it in about 5 minutes please come prepared. It would be
good to see what you're working on or is interesting to you.

We have picked up 3 new members since joining meetup.com. One has RSVP'd
for tomorrow. I know you haven't joined the
<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/owaspCLT">http://www.meetup.com/owaspCLT</A> group yet, so go do it now. I will wait. 

Thanks for showing your support of the group. :-) Thanks to Classic
Graphics for sponsoring the meetup account too.

So some details on how to get there. The address is:

8335 Classic Drive
Charlotte, NC 28269

However, if you're using GPS it knows nothing of this address, so use

8335 IBM Drive
Charlotte, NC 28269

There will be signs with the OWASP Charlotte logo on them directing
folks into the building and the meeting room. We'll have pizza and
drinks. Classic picks up the tab for the refreshments and only asks that
if you can, please pitch in a little something to help cover the costs. 

Alright, I'm looking forward to seeing yall tomorrow night.
