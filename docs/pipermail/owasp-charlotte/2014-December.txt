Message-ID: <CAEOipxc0d0r5HmDcKMXwM8yici8BfUXBkJZcvQh0PzQwzgL2eQ@mail.gmail.com>

First of all I wanted to share some news. After 7 years with Classic
Graphics, I have accepted a full-time position with Lowe's on their
pen-testing team. I will start on January 12th. Though I haven't brought it
up for discussion with my current employer, I believe that it is safe to
assume that they will no longer sponsor a meeting space or the meetup.com
fees.

As far as the meeting space goes, I've discussed it with Dr. Chu already
and we can still hold the meetings at UNCC. Which is nice. Nothing is set
in stone at this point, so if there are other options for a meeting space
let's discuss it here on the mailing list.

Now for the meetup.com discussion. Again, I haven't discussed this with
Classic Graphics, but I believe that it's a safe assumption that they will
no longer cover those fees. A meetup.com group runs $70/quarter or $280/yr.
We have $878 in our chapter bucket at the parent org. Almost 100% of the
new members that we've gained and continue to gain find us on Meetup. It is
the first place people go when looking for local meetings. OTOH, that is
about the only value it provides. We don't make full use of the site or
it's tools as part of our typical workflow.

In a few minutes I will send out 3 separate emails with a specific topic in
the subject line. I would appreciate you sharing your thoughts and two cent
on the following email and not this one.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <CAEOipxeCXB6oBY8EHr_t8CMomuCVTRWAkMsYU142U1bKmHa2vA@mail.gmail.com>

Meetup has brought many new people to our chapter meetings. However, this
doesn't necessarily translate into dues paying members. The amount of money
we currently have is $878. If those funds aren't replenished over time
would could get about 3 years of meetup.com fees paid for.

Other options:

1) Seek sponsors
2) Asks and encourage members to pay dues

Thoughts?

$280/year could be considered a lot, but it depends how many people come from the meet up. If it is closed, is anything archived or do they delete it forever?


Another con, is it is another place that has to be updated in addition to the wiki and G+

Has anyone looked into the API and what can be done with it?

When you are talking dues do you mean ask the people that came from meet up to help with the meet up fee's, or OWASP dues?

We should certainly encourage everyone to pay the OWASP dues and assign to the local chapter, or if they came from meet up, help with that. Perhaps holding the CISSP credits at ransom for OWASP members or ?charitable donations? towards the local funds - just a thought.

To recap OWASP dues are: $50 annually, $95 for 2 years or Lifetime for $500. 40% of dues go to a local chapter. So $20/year, $38 for 2 years and $200 once for lifetime members which would be the same as 10 years at the annual cost could go to our chapter.

Perhaps we should reach out to some organizations and see if they are willing to do the corporate OWASP membership. I haven?t looked at the by-laws on company sponsorship of a local chapter, but would question if that is allowed.

Those are my thoughts.

Works for me, and would probably help us get students visiting too.

Agree on all points w/ Owen. Additions below.

- I think any new people coming to the group through meetup is worth the
cost.
- Many people can afford the membership cost, and we should encourage that
(assuming they see value).
- We should check the by-laws on local chapter sponsorship. If it's allowed
in this form, I can bug my company for that much money.

Thanks,
John

As mentioned in the other email, any new members is worth this much money
IMO. Unless there's a better tool, I say keep it. Most OWASP chapters that
use something at all seem to be using meetup.

Thanks,
John

Are there any options for free or reduced-price parking, though?

Good point, I'd rather contribute to the chapter than pay for a parking spot. Although I thought after 5 it was free in certain areas.On Dec 14, 2014 7:46 AM, William Stranathan <will at thestranathans.com> wrote:

Dr. Chu, What is the situation with parking at the University after hours?

I would hope so. We certainly lost the students as part of the regular
crowd since moving a couple of miles up the road. :-\. I have missed
having them present.

As far as I can tell, about 90% of the new people finding out, joining,
and attending meetings are coming to us via meetup.com. And yes, once
it's gone it's deleted. I believe it will remain open for a time. Their
FAQ defines the process here.

Right. It's tedious, but I've been managing.

I have not. Though I'm typically in favor of automation, the amount of
work that I would put into automating this doesn't outweigh the time I
spend on it now. :-). Since you're volunteering, let me know when it's
working and I'll happily use it. j/k ;-)

Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Should we use chapter funds to cover
 meetup.com's fees

Not to toot my own horn or anything, but I renewed my membership back
around September. And I made sure to designate OWASP Charlotte as the
40% local chapter recipient. I'm guessing at least a couple others have
as well based on the current number in our bucket.

Corporations can sponsor similarly. Information about it here
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership.

I agree too about the meetup fees being worth it. We haven't been using
that money for anything else. As Will Stranathan mentioned, I do recall
a discussion about the use of meetup.com on the owasp-leaders list. I
missed the details about meetup for non-profits though. I'm searching
the list archives trying to find it. I will post again if and when I can
locate it.

One thing to keep in mind, people do have to pay for parking when we meet
at UNCC (I realize I have not been to a meeting since they were at UNCC),
but I do remember that being a concern for folks.  We can always meet
offsite and carpool onto campus to save some money.

For me, mornings are bad (kid activities), but afternoons/evenings would
work. It would open up opportunities for longer format activities, even
things you could bring kids to. I have no experience with that type of
stuff, but they certainly look fun. Thinking of those con activities like
lock picking, light electronics, etc.

I would attend a Saturday meeting. It's probably the only meeting I could
attend.

Sounds like a good idea, but Saturdays get booked up pretty quick. I'd 
be interested in going but can't commit without seeing dates - and is 
likely I wouldn't be able to make all four in the year.

It would open us up to have some more time things that can't be done in 
the week, possibly work on projects or collaborate on things like CSP.

I would certainly be interested in Saturday meetings. However, as a 
quarterly meeting what would be the agenda? Also, I wouldn't be opposed 
to having more frequent weekend meetings that are slated for workshops 
and training seminars as opposed to just speaker presentations.

Just my thoughts,

Rob
