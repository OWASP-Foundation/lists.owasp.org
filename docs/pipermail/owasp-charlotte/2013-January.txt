Subject: [Owasp-charlotte] Tuesday 2012-01-15 Meeting
Message-ID: <CAA8E+Yc5LkjOkUycSvaBA8dtAcJ1fbn8oq1VyvzvHZGprNK6ZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Our next Chapter meeting will be Tuesday, January 15 at Classic Graphics.
Our guest speaker will be Nabil Hannan, a Security Principal at Cigital.
He'll be presenting on password storage security. In light of all the
various sites where passwords were given up and not properly protected,
this will be a very timely and informational message.

The meeting will start promptly at 6:30 this time, so please arrive a few
minutes early.

Also, if somebody has a webcam or something we can hook up to a laptop,
please let me know. A lot of folks found the Google Hangout last time
beneficial, but I'm trying to figure out the best way to have Nabil and the
slides on the Hangout simultaneously.

This is great! Thanks for setting this up. When Google added Communities,
took me a couple of communities before I "got it", but I think they're a
brilliant implementation.

I don't know quite yet about ditching meetup - but I suppose it depends on
where most of the traffic goes.

Hey all. I've created a Google Plus Community at
https://plus.google.com/communities/107822512199764250166/events.
Please come join the community. I personally am logged into Google all
day and I find it a much simpler way to communicate with others.

It offers many of the same features as Meetup, yet in Google fashion
it is completely free to use.

In time, if everyone or most everyone, finds this as good as or more
suitable than Meetup.com I can see completely ditching Meetup.
