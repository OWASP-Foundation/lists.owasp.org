Good afternoon,

My name is Joseph Cooper and I am a Cyber Security Recruitment Consultant working for Iceberg Cyber Security and I have a passion for application security.

The reason for getting in touch with the OWASP community today is because experienced application security professionals like yourself are in high demand right now and I'm looking to speak with the elite AppSec talent in Belfast and London.

Two of my top tier clients who are technology solution providers are currently recruiting for a talented permanent application security specialist at a very senior level, to build a brand new security capability and establish their security practices, support the design and test their services being delivered for both application and infrastructure components.

My clients are spread across the globe and they deliver projects both from client site, and from their offices. While they attempt to base you on projects near or at your contracted office location (London/Belfast), you need to be willing to travel to client sites and spend time away during the week if it is required.

Excellent salaries are on offer from ?60,000 - ?120,000 + bonus and benefits.

Please can we exchange contact information and arrange a time to speak?

Kind regards

Joseph Cooper
