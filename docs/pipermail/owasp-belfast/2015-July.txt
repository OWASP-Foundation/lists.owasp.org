Hi All,

I was advised to post on this mailing list by an AppSec specialist, whilst on my search for an AppSec specialist, so I hope you don't mind the direct contact.

I have opportunities available in Belfast where I'm looking for people with experience in the following:


*         Experience in manual review of source code (Java, C#, C++)

*         Proficient level skills with application security testing tools including Burpsuite, SQL MAP, Metasploit, Fortify, Coverity

*         Professional level skills with UNIX or Linux

*         Skilled in the Microsoft Office suite of tools

*         Experience in assessment of HTTP and proprietary protocols

The responsibilities of the Application Security Engineer will include the following:

*         Perform a manual security assessment at several points of the SDLC

*         Lead security architecture reviews

*         Help development teams and QA set up static testing tools

*         Produce documentation on your manual assessments

*         Create meaningful metrics on the assessments that have been performed

*         Document and be able to present your findings to various stakeholders within the business

*         Be able to train others on the tools and processes that you use, and be comfortable sharing your knowledge with junior level employees and interns.



If interested, I can be contacted on Lee.Anderson at arm.co.uk<mailto:Lee.Anderson at arm.co.uk> or 02036 978434; I do also have a similar position available in London as well where the individual can either be based out of London, or work remotely from Belfast with periodic travel to my clients London office.
