Although conceived in the Security space, SABSA is a business-driven,
engineering-based, development process used widely for solving complex
problems and 'hot' topical challenges - of any kind. As an holistic
Enterprise framework SABSA is also widely utilised to align, integrate and
standardise approaches and methods throughout the Business, Architecture,
IT, Operations, Risk Management, Compliance &amp; Audit functions.  The ISACA
CSX Cybersecurity Fundamentals Certificate has a heavy focus on Security
Architecture Principles and SABSA is included in the syllabus. Security
Architecture features across the range of ISACA Certifications CISA, CISM,
CRISC and CGEIT. Managing Enterprise Architecture is a distinct process
within COBIT 5.

In this session David Lynas will conduct a SABSA &#8216;masterclass&#8217; discussion.
  This is an interactive session, where David will discuss a scenario where
a newly trained architect faces the reality of returning to his work, and
the manager asks &#8220;Right! Where do we start?&#8221;

Presenter Bio

For those of you who haven&#8217;t heard of David Lynas before, he is one of
three people who co-authored &#8220;Enterprise Security Architecture&#8221; A Business
Driven Approach. Better known as the Sherwood Applied Business Security
Architecture model (or SABSA for short). Since the model was first
published its popularity has grown into a cult following.

David Lynas is a globally renowned Enterprise Security Architect, Security
Strategist, and Thought-Leader. He is also one of the foremost
international authorities on the SABSA framework. With more than 25 years
experience in information security, David has been invited to provide
strategic advice to governments and industry clients on every continent.

In 2006 he was appointed as a Fellow of the British Computer Society (FBCS
CITP) for &#8220;Exceptional leadership, eminence and seniority in the field of
information security.&#8221; He is also the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement
Award from the Computer Security Institute &#8211; the only professional from
outside North America ever to receive this honour in CSI&#8217;s 33 year history.

David is the founder and chair of COSAC (www.cosac.net), a premier annual
global forum for innovation and leadership in the Infosec profession. He
was part of the original development team for the SABSA&#174; framework and is
co-author of Enterprise Security Architecture: A Business-Driven Approach
(2006), widely regarded as the pre-eminent reference text for information
security architecture professionals.
