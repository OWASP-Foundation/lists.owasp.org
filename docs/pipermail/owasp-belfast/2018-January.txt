Annual Privacy, Security & Trust (PST) conference provides a premier forum for sharing advances in cybersecurity research and security applications


** PST 2018 - Call for Papers
------------------------------------------------------------

Privacy, Security, and Trust 2018 (https://qub.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=74001ed540e2ac518e2579579&id=d8577df384&e=0b44565470) (PST 2018) will be held at the Queen?s University of Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom on August 28-30, 2018.

Innovation in ubiquitous interconnected technologies, together with the growth of interconnected computing and storage, defines the foundation to a vast landscape of unforeseen digital services and social networks. Instant access to services, real-time data and the ability to share content down to detailed social and very personal information. Developing sustainable communities and optimising the utilisation of resources, such as energy, led to the development of new technologies for smart utilities, smart cities, smart transport and the evolution of autonomous technologies for manufacturing and transport. Significant commercial opportunities promised by these technologies and services inevitably attract cybercrime and the need for research and innovation in Privacy, Security and Trust.

The Annual International Conference in Privacy, Security & Trust (PST) provides a premier forum for sharing advances in cybersecurity research and security applications.  PST2018 will be held in Northern Ireland at the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT) and Queen's University Belfast, and will offer three days of keynotes, technical presentations, posters, workshops, and an Industrial day with vendor exhibition.

INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS:
________________________________________
High-quality papers in all PST-related areas that, at the time of submission, are not under review and have not already been published or accepted for publication elsewhere are solicited. Authors MUST ensure to select the track (Privacy, Security, or Trust) most relevant to their research when submitting their paper. Accepted papers will be accepted as ?regular? papers up to 10 pages, or ?short? papers of up to 5 pages. The standard IEEE two-column conference format should be used for all submissions. IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings can be downloaded here:http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html
The conference proceedings will be submitted for inclusion in IEEE Xplore as in previous editions of the conference. At least one author of an accepted paper must register by June 29, 2018. A regular registration is required. Accepted (short or regular) papers will be published in the proceedings.

DOUBLE-BLIND SUBMISSION
------------------------------------------------------------

Reviewing will be double-blind: the reviewers will not know the identities of the authors. It will be up to the authors to ensure the proper anonymization of their paper.  For effective anonymization please follow these guidelines: Do not include any author name or affiliation in the title. Do not include any acknowledgments. Refer to your own published work in the third person: use ?In the previous work of Jones et al.?, not ?In our previous work?. If you cite own papers that are not widely available (e.g., a paper currently under review), use anonymous author names in the citation, for example, an author of the form ?A. Anonymous?.
