Dear OWASP Belfast members,

Have you recently returned to Northern Ireland to work in the cyber security industry having studied outside the region?

We are working with BBC Radio 4 on a business documentary on the cyber security industry here. It will air later this year.

They wish to interview some people who have recently returned home to work in cyber security in Northern Ireland.

The production team will be in Belfast w/c 5th Nov to carry out interviews with returners as well as others from the industry.

Please send me a quick message and I can put you in touch with the BBC team.

Grateful if you could share with your network too.

Best regards,

David
