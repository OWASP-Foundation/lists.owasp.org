Although conceived in the Security space, SABSA is a business-driven,
engineering-based, development process used widely for solving complex
problems and 'hot' topical challenges - of any kind. As an holistic
Enterprise framework SABSA is also widely utilised to align, integrate and
standardise approaches and methods throughout the Business, Architecture,
IT, Operations, Risk Management, Compliance & Audit functions.  The ISACA
CSX Cybersecurity Fundamentals Certificate has a heavy focus on Security
Architecture Principles and SABSA is included in the syllabus. Security
Architecture features across the range of ISACA Certifications CISA, CISM,
CRISC and CGEIT. Managing Enterprise Architecture is a distinct process
within COBIT 5.

In this session David Lynas will conduct a SABSA ?masterclass? discussion.
  This is an interactive session, where David will discuss a scenario where
a newly trained architect faces the reality of returning to his work, and
the manager asks ?Right! Where do we start??
