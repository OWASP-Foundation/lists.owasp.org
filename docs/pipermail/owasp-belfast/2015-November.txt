Subject: [OWASP-Belfast] Hands on Hacking with OWASP Security Shapherd
Message-ID: <CADpR4VqAmV0pvN=QFwM0qVs_A6vo+Go6mFMEMxt7ALCAOC+XQA@mail.gmail.com>

To signup go to: http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Belfast/events/226561409/

OWASP Belfast's November session will be a presentation and hands on
hacking experience with the OWASP Security Shepherd team.

We are excited to have Mark and Paul, the creators of Security Shepherd,
joining us for the night to talk us through the web site hacking tool that
educates the user while allowing them to hack their specialized site.

We will be meeting in the large lecture theatre in Queen's Ashby Building
for the night.  Participants should bring their laptops along as Mark and
Paul talk us through the Security Shepherd tool and allow us to hack our
way through it.  No previous experience of hacking web sites is required
(in fact the tool starts the user from basic hacks up to the most advanced).

Participants without laptops can still attend and learn about the tool and
hacking techniques involved.  Participants can also form teams to share
their laptops and hack the site faster.  The session is expected to run
from 6:30pm to around 8pm.

Unfortunately there will not be any pizza at this session, however there
will be an opportunity to socialize with Mark, Paul and the other attendees
afterwards.

Note: To prepare your laptop for the session, please install the Firefox
browser (or Google Chrome) and a proxy such as OWASP ZAP (free) or Burp.
