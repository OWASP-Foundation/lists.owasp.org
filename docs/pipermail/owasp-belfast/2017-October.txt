CSIT Labs, the cyber security incubator which provides three man months of engineering resource free, is open for applications for its 3rd cohort.

https://qub.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=74001ed540e2ac518e2579579&id=d0671355d4&e=0b44565470


** CSIT Labs Cohort 3 applications open
------------------------------------------------------------

CSIT Labs - https://qub.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=74001ed540e2ac518e2579579&id=ed6c3240b6&e=0b44565470 - the world's only incubator programme for cyber security start-ups which provides free engineering resource, has launched a call for applications to its third cohort. The incubator is based at Queen?s University Belfast?s Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT), the UK?s national Innovation and Knowledge Centre for cyber security.

Teams will partake in a 9 month managed incubator programme which, uniquely, provides up to 3 man-months of funded engineering development resource, to take ideas and promising research in the field of cyber security through to investment and market ready stage. The engineering effort alone represents a ?30,000 value to companies at a time when access to cybersecurity research and development resources for new ventures is particularly challenging and makes this incubator unique globally.
APPLY NOW (https://qub.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=74001ed540e2ac518e2579579&id=10f2b6478d&e=0b44565470)

6 participant teams will receive:
* up to 3 man months (fully funded) engineering support for production/prototype/proof of concept technology
* A series of workshops to iterate and validate the proposed market offering
* Mentoring from a network of industry, government and venture capitalist representatives
* Exposure to the CSIT global network
* Promotion through existing business development activities e.g CyberUK, RSA San Francisco and Infosecurity Europe

There is now requirement to relocate to Belfast and there is no cost for programme participation, however, those based outside of Northern Ireland will be expected to fund their own travel and accommodation to the workshops and essential meetings. See website for further details.

CSIT Labs takes no equity.

Applications close on 3rd December 2017.
APPLY NOW (https://qub.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=74001ed540e2ac518e2579579&id=9ee18651fb&e=0b44565470)

?Paladin recognises CSIT Labs as one of the premier cybersecurity accelerators in Europe. The calibre of the 2017 CSIT Labs entrepreneurs is world class and we look forward to your success.?
Gibb Witham, VP (Cyber Security), Paladin

It has been a pleasure working with CSIT and the cohort of companies.  All have demonstrated both breadth of expertise and great potential to scale. I will continue to follow their progress with interest and I'm pleased to see several already reaching new opportunities in London and beyond while continuing to draw on the deep expertise of CSIT and the Belfast ecosystem.?
Ben Brabyn, Chief Executive, Level39

It has been a pleasure to mentor the second cohort of CSIT Labs members. The maturity both of their ideas and their business acumen has progressed by leaps and bounds and I am confident that they have a great future. I look forward to watching cohort 2 progress yet further over the coming months and years.?
Andrew Nicholson, Head of Open Innovation, Thales
