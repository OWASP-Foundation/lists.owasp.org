The incubator is delivered by the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT), the UK?s national Innovation and Knowledge Centre for cyber security.

The programme lasts 9 months and uniquely provides up to 3 man-months of funded engineering development resource. This will support start-ups in the field of cyber security develop demonstrators and minimal viable product, hastening their transition through to investment and market readiness. The engineering effort alone represents a ?30,000 value to companies.
