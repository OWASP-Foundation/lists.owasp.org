<PRE>Hi all,

I attended a ISSA UK (London Chapter) event last Thursday, where amongst the
speakers were Howard Schmidt, Whitt Diffie (of Diffie-Hellman algorithm
fame), and Ed Gibson (the newly appointed Microsoft Security Spokesperson
and ex-FBI agent), and would definitely recommend hearing Howard Schmidt,
and I aim to go on the 5th October as well. One can assume that Ed Gibson
will be there as well, and if you have never met an ex-FBI agent (lets face
it most of us haven't, let alone have the opportunity to meet a White House
advisor) it may be your only chance.

Sounds like it will be a great session.

[P.S. I'm not on the ISSA London Chapter Committee, so this isn't an advert
on their behalf, but, last weeks meeting and all ISSA London meetings are
free to attend, and they are held in London with excellent speakers always,
check out the web site for future events on: <A HREF="http://www.issa-uk.org">http://www.issa-uk.org</A> ]

Hi all,

Thought you might be interested in attending this one:

Microsoft Developer Security Event with Top Independent Security Expert
Howard Schmidt

This is your chance to meet top security expert Howard Schmidt and attend an
evening event that will give you a valuable overview of developer security
in the UK and the Trustworthy Computing Initiative.
Howard has a wealth of experience in this field from his time at eBay,
Microsoft, US White House and US Air Force and will provide his perspective
on what we must do now and in the long term to provide secure software
assurance.

But discussion is better than listening =96 so arm yourself with your key
developer security questions and ask our expert panel.  The last hour will
be dedicated to your questions, with the panel of Howard Schmidt, Microsoft,
and Security partner SPI Dynamics and we'll be collecting questions on the
night.

Want to learn more about Howard Schmidt's background?  View his biography
