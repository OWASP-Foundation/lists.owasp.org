<PRE>This is the first reminder for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting
to be held on March 12th (Thursday), at the earlier time of 6:30pm (like the
previous meeting).

The location is the same as for the previous meeting, at KPMG who have
kindly agreed to sponsor the evening:

     KPMG, 39th Floor, One Canada Sq, E14 5AG

We have the following talks confirmed, and I'm waiting on confirmation of an
interesting application attack focused talk, so will send out another update
once the final schedule for the evening is set.

*  OWASP Global Industry Committee - Colin Watson
- The Global Industry Committee was one of six new OWASP committees created
during the EU Summit in Portugal last year. Colin Watson will talk about the
committee's aims, plan, how to get involved, who it has been engaging with
and what else it has been doing in the first few months.

* The Software Assurance Maturity Model - Introduction and a Use Case - Matt
Bartoldus
- The OWASP CLASP Project has been going through modification to move more
towards a maturity model. As a result, the Software Assurance Maturity Model
(SAMM) project has been released in a beta version. The goal is to &quot;define a
usable security framework with sequential, measurable goals that can be used
by small, medium, and large organisations in any line of business that
involves software development&quot;. This talk will introduce SAMM and give a
brief overview of its contents. We will then discuss how SAMM is currently
being used to measure the level of information security activities within an
EU based financial organisation's development methodology and providing the
framework for implementing such activities into their everyday development
activities (SDLC). 

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and it
looks like we could have a very good turnout from the number of RSVPs we've
received so far. 

If you are planning to attend please RSVP in an email to Hayley French from
KPMG (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">hayley.french at kpmg.co.uk</A>) and CC me (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">justin at justinclarke.com</A>).

Additional details and schedule for the night will go up on the chapter page
(<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London</A>) and mailing list as details firm
up.

See you there!

Justin Clarke
