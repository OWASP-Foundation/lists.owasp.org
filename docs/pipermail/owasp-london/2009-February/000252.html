<PRE>Well, what a great response - that's very encouraging!  It seems there
are plenty of potential helpers.

As mentioned by others, we would need to think about the what, where
and how.  I believe the Global Projects Committee may have discussed
the what at their last meeting:

<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/GPTC_Agenda_09_Fev_2009">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/GPTC_Agenda_09_Fev_2009</A>

The specific questions we may want to address right now are:

* is there / could there be an OWASP project that meets the TSB's
scope, &quot;involve business-to-business or business-to-science
interactions&quot; and &quot;make a significant step change and overall positive
contribution in terms of economic and business impact as well as
environmental and social sustainability taking into account the full
product lifecycle.&quot;?

* are the timescales suitable?

* who would OWASP need to work with / for (e.g. UK organisation), to
have a chance of having a successful application?

and I suppose, how the money thing would work, especially if there are
other parties and since people undertake OWASP projects voluntarily.
Has OWASP undertaken joint externally-funded projects previously?
