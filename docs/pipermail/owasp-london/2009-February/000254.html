<PRE>Yes it's that time again.  Nominet launched the Best Practice
Challenge 2009 last week at the UK Internet Governance Forum.

Last year we nominated OWASP in the Best Security Initiative Award and
Ivan Ristic wrote an engaging proposal.  Although we were shortlisted
(one of four), and were invited to the prize-giving ceremony, we did
not win.  However the judges did say:

   The judges felt that this project was democratic, international and
helps increase awareness of security issues.

There were also comments that it would be good to see how we
progressed.  The chair of the judging panel this year is again Rt Hon
Alun Michael MP.  Well, I think we should nominate OWASP again, either
alone, or in conjunction with the Scotland chapter?  By the way, the
idea of the awards is to find best practice, highlight it and take
this to the (UN) Internet Governance Forum's meeting in Sharm El
Sheikh, Egypt later in the year.  The IGF themes are security, access,
diversity and openness.

Another thought might be to get the Egyptian OWASP chapter involved
with the nomination?

Perhaps we can bring in some other aspects to our nomination - maybe
the inclusiveness of OWASP is a great seller?

One more attempt?
