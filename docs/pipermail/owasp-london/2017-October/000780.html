<PRE>All,

DevSecCon is back in London this year, to bring together DevOps and 
Security in a unique conference run by practitioners, for practitioners.

This year&#160; DevSecCon London 2017 will be run over two days (19-20 
October 2017) and will include talks and interactive workshops about 
DevSecOps &#8211; the practice of building security into development 
processes. This is your chance to learn from the key industry figures, 
meet with your peers and learn how DevOps and Security can work together 
to make continuously secure development a reality.

The DevSecCon London 2017 Day 1 keynote talk will be delivered by Daniel 
Cuthbert - one of the 'founding fathers' of OWASP and OWASP London, the 
author of OWASP Testing Guide and the co-author of OWASP ASVS.

Day 2 keynote talk will be delivered by Dinis Cruz, yet another 
'founding father' of OWASP London. Dinis served on the OWASP Global 
Board of Directors in 2008-2011, he is also the project leader of OWASP 
O2, the co-author of OWASP SAMM and many other guidelines and tools. 
Dinis is also the organiser of OWASP Summits in 2009,2011,2017 (and 
hopefully in 2018) and of course he is a speaker at many OWASP London 
events and international conferences.
