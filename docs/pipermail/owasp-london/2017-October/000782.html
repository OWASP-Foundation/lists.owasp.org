<PRE>OWASP London Chapter is pleased to announce that the next OWASP London 
CTF Tournament for Application Developers will take place on Thursday, 
9th November 2017.

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a type of computer security competition. 
Contestants are presented with a set of challenges and puzzles which 
test their creativity, technical coding (and googling) skills, and 
problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories 
and when solved, each yields a &#8220;flag&#8221; which is submitted to a real-time 
scoring service. The difficulty levels are from beginner to advanced.

CTF tournaments are a great and fun way for software developers to learn 
a wide array of application security skills in a safe and legal environment.

Top scorers will win prizes kindly donated by cyber security technology 
vendors.

Most programming languages supported.
