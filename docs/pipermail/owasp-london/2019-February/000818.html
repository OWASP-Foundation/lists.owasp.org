<PRE>Good morning everyone on the owasp-london mailing list,

The OWASP Global mailing list infrastructure is under an increased spam 
attack at the moment - you may have noticed that one annoying spam 
message made it through to our owasp-london mailing list last night. 
Please accept my apologies for any distress it may have caused. I hope 
most people on this mailing list are information security-savvy 
individuals and I hope that everybody was able to recognise that it was 
a spam. There is no need to send any Bitcoins to anybody and your email 
details are safe - the message was sent to the group e-mail and was not 
filtered out for some reason by the spam filter.

The OWASP Foundation is in the process of retiring the current 
Mailman-based mailing list system and moving the mailing lists over to 
Google Groups.&#160; The specific plan with all the dates, the process, etc 
will be posted by the OWASP Global staff on the OWASP wiki within the 
next few days and as soon as the details are known we will publish them 
via this mailing list and other channels as well.

In order be notified of our upcoming events and announcements please
