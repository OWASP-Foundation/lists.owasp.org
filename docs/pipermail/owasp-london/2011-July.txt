(Cross-post to all 4 UK chapter lists)

The Commons Select Committee has decided to gather evidence on the
impact of malware on individuals, the responsibilities of Government
to aid in preventing malware infections and the economy that has grown
up around this industry.

http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/news/110719-new-inquiry---malware/

The focus is on user protection.

1. Should OWASP make a submission?

2. Does anyone have time to draft a submission?

The deadline is noon on Wednesday 7 September 2011.  Interestingly
responses need to be sent by email with "Malware" as the subject line.
