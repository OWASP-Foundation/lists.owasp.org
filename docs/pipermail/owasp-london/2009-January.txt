Hi OWASP London,

I am happy to announce that Justin Clarke is stepping forward to take 
care of OWASP London from now on. Those of you who attended the meeting 
in December know Justin as the guy who spoke (twice) on the night. If 
you were not there, you can see Justin here:

I am also happy to say that I think our local chapter is doing well. We 
had over 34 people attend our previous meeting, and that is the best 
attendance so far.

If we continue like this pretty soon we will be organising a London 
conference!

Ivan

Ivan,

Thanks for your stewardship since April 2007.  The chapter is growing, and
will be in good hands, and I hope we'll still see you at meetings?

And as for a London conference, that's a definite possibility if we can keep
up the momentum!

Best regards

Justin

Subject: [Owasp-london] Next meeting: March 12th, KPMG, Canary Wharf
Message-ID: <C5950B9D.6B85%justin@justinclarke.com>

Dates have been confirmed for our next meeting, which is going to
be held on March 12th (Thursday), at the earlier time of 6:30pm (like the
December 4th meeting).

The location is the same as for the previous meeting, at KPMG who have
kindly agreed to sponsor the evening:

     KPMG, 39th Floor, One Canada Sq, E14 5AG

At this point, get this date in your calendars. I am looking for anyone who
is interested in speaking, otherwise I'll go ahead and arrange speakers - if
you're working on something interesting, now is the time to come forward and
talk about it!

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network after the
meeting, and may end up going out for dinner afterwards as happened last
time.

If you are planning to attend please send an email to Hayley Green from
KPMG (hayley.green at kpmg.co.uk) and CC me (justin at justinclarke.com).

Additional details and schedule for the night will go up on the chapter page
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London) and mailing list as details firm
up.

See you there!

Justin Clarke

Subject: [Owasp-london] Update on COI Browser Standards for Public Websites
Message-ID: <b46e4cdd0901291257t3322aad4k8de39f1f405e7cf4@mail.gmail.com>

Last October, we submitted a response to the draft "Browser Standards
for Public Websites" from the Central Office of Information (COI).

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/London#Other_Activities
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Scotland#Other_Activities

The final version (1.0) was issued earlier this month:

http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=212
http://www.coi.gov.uk/documents/guidance/browser-testing-guidelines-v1-0.pdf

and has now been renamed to "Browser Testing Guidelines".  It seems
our suggestions have not been incorporated into the new slimmer
document.  The only related change seems to have been "Browser
security testing" being added as out of scope to the Introduction
(page 2).

Thanks to everyone who helped.  We can continue to try to influence
standards, policies and legislation.

Regards

Colin
