<PRE>All - I'm sending this out to the list as very relevant and as such we've negotiated a special rate for OWASP Members. If you're not an OWASP member, sign up now and you'll still end up saving around &#163;70!

The inaugural ISSD Conference is taking place at The Westminster Conference 
Centre, London from 20th to 21st May 2010, and will feature a range of UK 
and international speakers giving presentations on developing new 
applications securely, and adding security to legacy applications - both 
standard and web-based.

as well as Lord Toby Harris, Professor Jim Norton, Ari Takanen, Peter Wood,

Technical implementation teams responsible for developing secure systems 
within an organisation. This would include Lead Developers, Systems 
Architects, CISO's, CTO's, Compliance, Risk &amp; Audit Professionals,
