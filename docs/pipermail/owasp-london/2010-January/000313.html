<PRE>Justin, can you set some time to talk about the plans to do training in
London? (I also remember that there was some requests for us (or somebody)
to give an update of what happened at OWASP since the last chapter meeting)

We could do this at the beginning or at the middle (before the 2nd session)

Also, would it be worthwhile to have a number of print-outs of the latest
OWASP Newsletter?

2010/1/4 Justin Clarke &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">justin.clarke at owasp.org</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to be
</I>&gt;<i> held on January 14th (next Thursday), at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue
</I>&gt;<i> between 6pm-6:30pm).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're at a new location this time, at Nomura who have kindly agreed to let
</I>&gt;<i> us use their facilities:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Nomura, Nomura House, 1 St Martins-le-Grand, London EC1A 4NP
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Should be easier to find this time - this is near to St Pauls in the City,
</I>&gt;<i> and Google Maps etc should be more accurate this time around for showing
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> where it is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should
</I>&gt;<i> have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well
</I>&gt;<i> and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.">http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.</A> Note, please enter your real name, as
</I>&gt;<i> this will be given to Nomura building security. If you don't RSVP, you may
</I>&gt;<i> not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close midday the day of
</I>&gt;<i> the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in
</I>&gt;<i> advance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">justin.clarke at owasp.org</A> so your space can be released for someone else.

</I>&gt;<i> * Top Ten Deployment Mistakes That Render SSL Useless - Ivan Ristic
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SSL is the technology that secures the Internet, but it only works when
</I>&gt;<i> properly configured. Unfortunately, because SSL is assumed to be easy to
</I>&gt;<i> use
</I>&gt;<i> (and it genuinely is), there is a lack of information how to use it
</I>&gt;<i> properly. As a result, too many web sites use insecure deployment practices
</I>&gt;<i> that render SSL completely useless. In this talk I will present a list of
</I>&gt;<i> top ten (or thereabout) deployment mistakes, based on my work on the SSL
</I>&gt;<i> Labs assessment platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *  Using Selenium to hold state for web application penetration testing -
</I>&gt;<i> Yiannis Pavlosoglou
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Selenium is a web application testing framework often used for unit testing
</I>&gt;<i> and functional testing during the later parts of web application
</I>&gt;<i> development. This presentation examines how this tool, in particular the
</I>&gt;<i> Selenium IDE &lt;<A HREF="http://seleniumhq.org">http://seleniumhq.org</A>&gt; , can be used for creating security
</I>&gt;<i> unit tests. By emulating a systematic logon, logoff or browse to a
</I>&gt;<i> particular location, web application penetration tests can be performed
</I>&gt;<i> using Selenium. Furthermore, fuzzing payloads can be scripted as inputs for
</I>&gt;<i> security tests. As a result, issues of holding state, or having valid
</I>&gt;<i> authentication credentials to test a particular input for, say, Cross Site
</I>&gt;<i> Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection can be performed in a much shorter time
</I>&gt;<i> duration. This presentation will take the audience through the process of
</I>&gt;<i> setting up, scripting and running Selenium against a vulnerable web
</I>&gt;<i> application. It's aim is to relay back one successful approach that has
</I>&gt;<i> been
</I>&gt;<i> used in the field in order to discover vulnerabilities through stateful
</I>&gt;<i> fuzzing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ==Speakers==
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ivan Ristic is a respected security expert and book author, known
</I>&gt;<i> especially
</I>&gt;<i> for his contribution to the web application firewall field and the
</I>&gt;<i> development of ModSecurity, an open source web application firewall. He is
</I>&gt;<i> the author of Apache Security, a comprehensive security guide for the
</I>&gt;<i> Apache
</I>&gt;<i> web server. A frequent speaker at computer security conferences, Ivan is an
</I>&gt;<i> active participant in the application security community, member of the
</I>&gt;<i> Open
</I>&gt;<i> Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and officer of the Web Application
</I>&gt;<i> Security Consortium (WASC).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Coming from a solid academic background in information security, Yiannis
</I>&gt;<i> has
</I>&gt;<i> spent a number of years in industry, formerly with companies such as
</I>&gt;<i> Verizon
</I>&gt;<i> and Ounce Labs. He is the managing partner at Seleucus Ltd, based in
</I>&gt;<i> London.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the
</I>&gt;<i> chapter page ( <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London</A> ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See you there!
