All,

With 2016 coming to an end we hope you enjoyed being a part of OWASP 
London Chapter events this year. We had 7 events in 2016: 5 Chapter 
meetings and 2 Hackathon/CTF events.

OWASP London Chapter is now looking forward to an interesting and 
eventful year 2017. We plan to run a minimum of 5 Chapter meetings in 
2017. Our events are free and open to anyone interested in Information 
and Application Security and are usually attended by 70-100 attendees.

We encourage security professionals, researchers and developers to 
present talks at our upcoming Chapter events.

OWASP mainly focuses on these 3 tracks:

  - Builders

zero-days, any vulnerabilities must be responsibly disclosed prior to
