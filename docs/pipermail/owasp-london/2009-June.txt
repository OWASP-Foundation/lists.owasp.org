Justin,

As promised, the slides (in PDF Format) for "TCP Input Text" and "Speak
English - Google Translate Workaround" that I presented at the recent OWASP
London Chapter May 2009 Meeting after 5th CONFidence 2009 in Poland have now
been published.

There are two versions of the slide artwork and hence those who would prefer
not to view the NSFW (i.e. Not Suitable For Work) slide artwork SHOULD NOT
download the second URL below (as the text is the same in both slides):

Justin,

I have published the slides from the recent OWASP European Conference which
I presented at the recent OWASP London Chapter May 2009 Meeting to
http://snipurl.com/cmlh_owaspeu2k9_slides_pdf

These do not include the slides for *TCP Input Text* or the *"Speak English"
Google Translate Workaround* that I recently presented at 5th CONFidence in
Poland but I will upload these shortly.

Subject: [Owasp-london] Announcement - Next meeting Thursday the 9th of July,
 at Barclays in Canary Wharf
Message-ID: <C654A154.D670%justin.clarke@owasp.org>

This is the announcement for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to
be held on July 9th (Thursday), at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between
6pm-6:30pm). 

We're at the same location as the last meeting, however in a different room
this time, at Barclays who have kindly agreed to
sponsor the evening:

Barclays, Rooms 42/43, One Churchill Place, London E14 5HP

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should
have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well.

If you are planning to attend please RSVP. As mentioned at the last meeting,
we're going to trial an event signup system, so please RSVP at
http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com. Note, please enter your real name, as
this will be given to Barclays building security to ensure you are let into
the building.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at
justin.clarke at owasp.org so your space can be released for someone else.

* O2 - Advanced Source Code Analysis Toolkit - Dinis Cruz

In this talk Dinis Cruz will show the open source toolkit O2 (Ounce Open)
which is specifically designed for developers and security consultants to be
able to perform quick, effective and thorough source code security reviews.
The O2 toolkit (http://www.o2-ounceopen.com) uses the scanning engines from
Ounce Labs,  Microsoft's CAT.NET tool and FindBugs (with more engines to be
added soon) and allows advanced filtering, manipulation and visualization of
its findings. In the past, there has been a very healthy skepticism on the
usability of Source Code analysis engines to find commonly found
vulnerabilities in real world applications. This presentation will show that
with some creative and powerful tools, it IS possible to use O2 to discover
those issues. 

* The Ultimate IDS Smackdown - How red vs. blue situations can influence
more than one might assume - Mario Heiderich and Gareth Heyes

The talk is a vector and coding showdown between the lead dev of the PHPIDS
and one of its most determined challengers trying and managing to break it
wherever possible. Expect a bloody battle between security researchers and
developers without limits, regular expression magic against code obfuscation
excellence leading to an interesting result about vs-situations in software
development and IT security.

Speakers

* Mario Heiderich - I am Mario Heiderich, cologne based CTO for an online
enterprise based in Cologne and New York. I was visitor and speaker on
several OWASP conferences, maintain the PHPIDS and other security related
projects and recently authored a German book on Web Security together with
Christian Matthies, fukami and Johannes Dahse. I am currently into browser
security, broken markup, client side attacks and digging the HTML5
specifications.

* Gareth Heyes - I'm from the UK and I like hacking javascript and XSS
filters. I am not a security expert, in fact I'm the anti-security expert.
Don't expect statistics from me, I like vectors and interesting code. I
authored Hackvertor and many other security related tools.

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the
chapter page ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London ).

See you there!
