<PRE>I meet today with a security professional that works for a company who
is responsible for their internal security education program, and (in
principle) is ok to present to OWASP the amazing solution that they have
come up internally to educate their 1000s of divisions/teams across the
world.

He works at Stockley Park, so I was thinking that we should organize an
OWASP west-london chapter meeting over there.

All we need is a meeting room (and maybe some pizza) , any offers :)

At this session we should also present the latest research for Moxie on a
solution for SSL (convergence) and David Rice's presentation at last year's
AppSec USA where he makes a really great analogy between 'Pollution and
Security'
