<PRE>Christian,

I think you're jumping to conclusions. From the mention of Stockley Park I suspect I know who Dinis is talking about (FTSE 100 company Dinis?) and I'd be very keen to have a non-consultant talk on various topics like this. For this reason I've also been chasing one of the folks at GE Money to come down and talk about how they've deployed OpenSamm, as they are internal to the org, and as such have a different perspective to those of us who are external.
