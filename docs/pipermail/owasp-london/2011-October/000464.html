<PRE>Hi, here is the presentation I delivered last week at OWASP's AppSec Brazil
conference: OWASP Brazil - Making Security Invisible by Becoming the
Developer's Best
Friends&lt;<A HREF="http://o2platform.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Brazil%20-%20Making%20Security%20Invisible%20by%20Becoming%20the%20Developer%27s%20Best%20Friends%20v2.pdf">http://o2platform.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Brazil%20-%20Making%20Security%20Invisible%20by%20Becoming%20the%20Developer%27s%20Best%20Friends%20v2.pdf</A>&gt;

I think I was able to capture how security tends to be seen by developers,
how it is currently a TAX on the SDL and how we need to move Application
Security into the 'application visibility' space so that we add value to the
entire SDL (and create a positive model where the developers want to engage
with us)

After you read the presentation, check out this video which I recorded also
in Brazil: A developer's rant about security
professionals&lt;<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYEPYSF32kQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYEPYSF32kQ</A>&gt;
(he was one of the developers that was at the audience which really related
to the problem of receiving security guidance from security 'consultants'
that don't understand his app).

The demos showed how O2 allowed this world to exist :)

Let me know what you think of it.
