Subject: [Owasp-london] Reminder: Next OWASP London Event - December Chapter
	Meeting - Next Thursday, 12th December 2013, 6:30pm-8:30pm
Message-ID: <82AB5D42-60AD-4C03-9006-52032047B026@owasp.org>

All,

In the run up to the holiday break we have one more OWASP meeting, coming up on Thursday the 12th of December at Morgan Stanley.

Talks are confirmed, and once again we?ve lucked out being in London with catching an international OWASP speaker in London, Ofer Maor.
	
? IAST: Runtime Code & Data Security Analysis ? Beyond SAST/DAST - Ofer Maor
Until recently, SAST/DAST dominated the application security testing market, each with its own pros and cons. We present IAST, a new approach, analysing code execution, memory and data in runtime, allowing for accurate inspection of the application. The presentation will present the basic IAST technology building blocks and their benefits, followed by discussing advanced IAST data analysis capabilities, which allow for a deeper analysis of the application and its business logic. We will discusses different approaches and implementations of IAST and Runtime code analysis, discussing the benefits of each. The presentation will include practical samples (including code!) of how IAST can be used to accurately detect both simple and complicated vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection, Parameter Tampering, Persistent XSS, CSRF, and more?

? OWASP Cornucopia - Colin Watson
Microsoft's Escalation of Privilege (EoP) threat modelling card game has been refreshed into a new version more suitable for common web applications, and aligned with OWASP advice and guides. "OWASP Cornucopia - Ecommerce Web Application Edition" will be presented and used to demonstrate how it can help software architects and developers identify security requirements from the OWASP Secure Coding Practices - Quick Reference Guide. He will also provide a brief introduction about how to contribute ideas and content to OWASP projects, and how to start a project.

Hi folks

in the London October OWASP talk a dev introduced/showed an eclipse
plugin, he was working on, providing code introspection security
suggestions. I was looking for an update on the status of this plugin
to give it a try.

Any news on this plugin?

thanks

Diego
