<PRE>Sadly, I think you're probably right.  I also agree with Jim that this is likely largely an information problem. Firstly, and organisation may not even be aware that they have had a breach from a web application attack. Also, in the case that they are aware of a breach they may not be able to quantify the problem through lack of logged information.  I've only come across one instance where an organisation we've worked with had a good record of exactly what data was exposed, and even in that case it was largely blind luck that they had been logging that information...

In the case that an organisation with my data is aware they've had a breach that they can't quantify I'd like to see them assume that the information has been exposed and act accordingly, but do they see it that way?

regards

Justin

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately I find it extremely hard to believe that no UK based organisation (or their outsourced providers) didn't suffer a relevant data breach in the last two and half years.  Probably the most relevant from an ICO point of view would be data theft via SQL Injection, and I know of at least one non-UK organisation that would have been in breach of this with a SQL Injection attack on UK sourced personal data.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps this shows a gap in what ICO is looking for? There are a lot of difficulties with web attacks in quantifying what was exposed (you usually have to assume it all was) so perhaps this is just something that fits into the &quot;too hard&quot; bucket? Or are organisations not even reporting these to the ICO? I'd think its probably the latter, as many of the SME organisations I'm aware of wouldn't have a clue as to their responsibilities, and some bigger organisations aren't much better...

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Over the weekend, I did a brief analysis of the enforcement notices that

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The idea was to see how many incidents were a result of a website hack
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (SQL Injection, XSS etc.)  About 100 enforcements are listed on the  ICO
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> website covering the period from January 2008 to August 2010.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I found that none of the breaches were the result of a website hack. No
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> SQL injection, XSS, CSRF attacks etc. The vast majority were related to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unencrypted USB sticks, CDs, laptops etc. which have been lost or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stolen. The next most popular cause was loss or theft of paper records.
