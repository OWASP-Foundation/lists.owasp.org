I was surprised by the results myself. I agree with you that many 
(most?) breaches are probably not reported to the ICO. 
The Irish Data Protection Commissioner has proposed new rules for 
obligatory data breach notification in Ireland.
    <A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/10/ireland_data_rules/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/10/ireland_data_rules/</A>
It will be interesting to see what impact they have - if they come into 
force.

regards

Alexis

&gt;<i> Unfortunately I find it extremely hard to believe that no UK based organisation (or their outsourced providers) didn't suffer a relevant data breach in the last two and half years.  Probably the most relevant from an ICO point of view would be data theft via SQL Injection, and I know of at least one non-UK organisation that would have been in breach of this with a SQL Injection attack on UK sourced personal data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps this shows a gap in what ICO is looking for? There are a lot of difficulties with web attacks in quantifying what was exposed (you usually have to assume it all was) so perhaps this is just something that fits into the &quot;too hard&quot; bucket? Or are organisations not even reporting these to the ICO? I'd think its probably the latter, as many of the SME organisations I'm aware of wouldn't have a clue as to their responsibilities, and some bigger organisations aren't much better...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Over the weekend, I did a brief analysis of the enforcement notices that

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> organisations found to be in breach of the Data Protection Act.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The idea was to see how many incidents were a result of a website hack 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (SQL Injection, XSS etc.)  About 100 enforcements are listed on the  ICO 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> website covering the period from January 2008 to August 2010.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I found that none of the breaches were the result of a website hack. No 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SQL injection, XSS, CSRF attacks etc. The vast majority were related to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unencrypted USB sticks, CDs, laptops etc. which have been lost or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stolen. The next most popular cause was loss or theft of paper records.
