<PRE>I reread my email again and it does come across a bit dejected ;-)

I wonder if there is any scope to help the ICO in knowing what they're looking for? After all, they clearly state &quot;website&quot; in much of the guidance as something that is within what they're looking for, but clearly they're not handing out enforcement notices either?  As opposed to physical data breach, its all too likely that UK personal data ends up overseas and/or with criminal gangs rather than with lost or stolen USB sticks and laptops (which may have just been wiped and onsold).

regards

Justin

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately I find it extremely hard to believe that no UK based organisation (or their outsourced providers) didn't suffer a relevant data breach in the last two and half years.  Probably the most relevant from an ICO point of view would be data theft via SQL Injection, and I know of at least one non-UK organisation that would have been in breach of this with a SQL Injection attack on UK sourced personal data.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps this shows a gap in what ICO is looking for? There are a lot of difficulties with web attacks in quantifying what was exposed (you usually have to assume it all was) so perhaps this is just something that fits into the &quot;too hard&quot; bucket? Or are organisations not even reporting these to the ICO? I'd think its probably the latter, as many of the SME organisations I'm aware of wouldn't have a clue as to their responsibilities, and some bigger organisations aren't much better...

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hello list,

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Over the weekend, I did a brief analysis of the enforcement notices that 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have been handed out by the UK Information Commissioner (ICO) to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> organisations found to be in breach of the Data Protection Act.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The idea was to see how many incidents were a result of a website hack 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (SQL Injection, XSS etc.)  About 100 enforcements are listed on the  ICO 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> website covering the period from January 2008 to August 2010.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I found that none of the breaches were the result of a website hack. No 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> SQL injection, XSS, CSRF attacks etc. The vast majority were related to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unencrypted USB sticks, CDs, laptops etc. which have been lost or 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stolen. The next most popular cause was loss or theft of paper records.
