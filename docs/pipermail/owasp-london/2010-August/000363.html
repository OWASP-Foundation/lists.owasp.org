<PRE>Unfortunately I find it extremely hard to believe that no UK based organisation (or their outsourced providers) didn't suffer a relevant data breach in the last two and half years.  Probably the most relevant from an ICO point of view would be data theft via SQL Injection, and I know of at least one non-UK organisation that would have been in breach of this with a SQL Injection attack on UK sourced personal data.

Perhaps this shows a gap in what ICO is looking for? There are a lot of difficulties with web attacks in quantifying what was exposed (you usually have to assume it all was) so perhaps this is just something that fits into the &quot;too hard&quot; bucket? Or are organisations not even reporting these to the ICO? I'd think its probably the latter, as many of the SME organisations I'm aware of wouldn't have a clue as to their responsibilities, and some bigger organisations aren't much better...

regards

Justin
