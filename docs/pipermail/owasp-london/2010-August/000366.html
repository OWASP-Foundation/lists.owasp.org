<PRE>Justin and Alexis

The current relevant guidance documents are:

Guidance on data security breach management, 27 March 2008
<A HREF="http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/guidance_on_data_security_breach_management.pdf">http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/guidance_on_data_security_breach_management.pdf</A>

Notification of Data Security Breaches to the Information
Commissioner&#8217;s Office, v4, 8 July 2010
<A HREF="http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/breach_reporting.pdf">http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/breach_reporting.pdf</A>

It seems to be being updated, so they may be open to a pro-active
approach with suggestions.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over the weekend, I did a brief analysis of the enforcement notices that
</I>&gt;<i> have been handed out by the UK Information Commissioner (ICO) to
</I>&gt;<i> organisations found to be in breach of the Data Protection Act.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea was to see how many incidents were a result of a website hack
</I>&gt;<i> (SQL Injection, XSS etc.)  About 100 enforcements are listed on the  ICO
</I>&gt;<i> website covering the period from January 2008 to August 2010.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I found that none of the breaches were the result of a website hack. No
</I>&gt;<i> SQL injection, XSS, CSRF attacks etc. The vast majority were related to
</I>&gt;<i> unencrypted USB sticks, CDs, laptops etc. which have been lost or
</I>&gt;<i> stolen. The next most popular cause was loss or theft of paper records.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Should Daniel, Dinis, Ivan, Justin pat themselves on the back - a job
</I>&gt;<i> well done?
