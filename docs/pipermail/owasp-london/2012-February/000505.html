At Cray some 20 years ago we ran a number of metrics such as halstead and mccabe against test coverage results
to select sections of code for review. A review teams was then given specific individual taks for the review.
Lets just say the process saved Cray so much money on the sofwtare side that the hardware engineers used the
same process to review designs and microcode etc.

Christine Leake was one of the instigators of the project and was one of the very few professional &quot;test
engineers&quot; I have ever met.

My opinion...

These days we can automate a lot of tests such as bounds case generation, fuzzers etc
but you stil need to ensure the basics - does the app work and has the entrie codebase been tested
- for some definition of tested.

Another skill a good developer often lacks is the ability to prune down a test case so that it will
do its job and fit into the test suite. TTD is a good start for developers but reviews of tests and
especially test cases for fixes are critical.
