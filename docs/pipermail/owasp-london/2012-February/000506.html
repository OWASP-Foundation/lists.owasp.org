This is decidedly A Bad Idea (TM). One must teach the correct way to do
things. One does not use bad examples to teach good behaviour.

We are discussing what to do with an ICT curriculum in schools, when youth
have little to no computer science or development background. They need to
learn the correct thing first. Only when they have a strong grounding in
best practices (which themselves are the subject of some debate) is a
comparison against broken software useful.


Consider spelling. One does not teach spelling by providing a long list of
misspelled words to children who don't yet know how to spell. One teaches
the correct spelling first. Once the foundations are well built, one might
introduce incorrect examples as a means of testing or reinforcing the
learning. But the most important thing to teach first is the right thing
to do.

Hacking and exploiting are cool in the way that graffiti and vandalism are
cool. They are destructive activities that cannot, on their own, create
something. They certainly don't need to be taught to kids who don't yet
know how to do good development.
