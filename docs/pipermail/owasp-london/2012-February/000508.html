</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
since when learning how to hack and exploit security issues is bad examples?

It takes real skill, focus, determination, knowledge and passion to find
and exploit those issues. It's much more like detective work.

The key problem is that it is very hard to visualize what you mean by 'good
behaviour' until what you call 'bad behaviour' is understood.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are discussing what to do with an ICT curriculum in schools, when youth
</I>&gt;<i> have little to no computer science or development background. They need to
</I>&gt;<i> learn the correct thing first.
</I>

NO, absolutely not.

They need to learn passion and love and craftsmanship first.

Programming is an Artistic endeavour, just like Maths (if you don't
understand what I mean, I would point you to Paul Lockhart's &quot;*A
Matematician's Lament*&quot; which is amazing and clearly explains what Math's
should be all about: <A HREF="http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_03_08.html">http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_03_08.html</A> )

In fact, we should be careful not to make the same mistakes (for
programming and secure programming) that the Math's crowd did when they set
up the current Math's curricular


&gt;<i> Only when they have a strong grounding in
</I>&gt;<i> best practices (which themselves are the subject of some debate) is a
</I>&gt;<i> comparison against broken software useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Skiping the fact that even professionals in the programming and appSec
industry still have not come up with definitions and standards of 'best
practices', you can't teach by showing solutions. You teach (and learn
effectively) by providing a 'problem scenario' (where security is just a
component), and then letting the students find multiple ways to tackle
(with the teacher providing clues along the way)


&gt;<i> Consider spelling. One does not teach spelling by providing a long list of
</I>&gt;<i> misspelled words to children who don't yet know how to spell.
</I>

sorry, but actually you do :)

I have a 6 and 8 year old and just saw this happening in front of me. In
the beginning the teachers are much more focused on getting the kid
interested in reading books, and they are not that bothered if the kid
reads the wrong word. The key is that the kid learns to like reading.

Correct spelling actually comes after reading, where once the kid starts to
learn how to sound things, he/she is thought the gramatical rules and
eventually have speling tests on blocks of words. Even then, the teachers
will reward kids that make good efforts and write down a spelling that
phonetically is equivalent

For example, I have in front of me a drawing from my 6 years old where she
has these words pointing to a picture:


   - iys
   - nows
   - grat
   - pursn


can you guess what they means? :)

One teaches
&gt;<i> the correct spelling first. Once the foundations are well built, one might
</I>&gt;<i> introduce incorrect examples as a means of testing or reinforcing the
</I>&gt;<i> learning. But the most important thing to teach first is the right thing
</I>&gt;<i> to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ironically, what you describe is how a lot of computing and programming
actually is taught today, and it is clearly is not working.

Note that I had a LOT of teachers at university and college that used those
techniques, and I learned more about computers trying to write C++ and
Assembly to play tricks on my colleges, than I ever did via the 'building
good foundations' way


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hacking and exploiting are cool in the way that graffiti and vandalism are
</I>&gt;<i> cool.
</I>

That is your pre-conceived ideas of hacking, and maybe this is where we
have to part ways.

If you study history you will see that most computing advances where
created by hacking activities, and reducing it to 'vandalism' is bringing
down this conversation to a very low level.

You might as well say it is a 'terrorist activity' and remove any
rationality from this thread


&gt;<i> They are destructive activities that cannot, on their own, create
</I>&gt;<i> something.
</I>

I believe in science they call this 'experimentation' , 'validation' and
'peer-review'.

Again if you think that only destructive actions come from hacking and
security exploitation, then there is not a lot I can say that will change
your mind.


&gt;<i> They certainly don't need to be taught to kids who don't yet
</I>&gt;<i> know how to do good development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I happen to think the exact oposite, so maybe it is better if we just agree
to disagree :)
