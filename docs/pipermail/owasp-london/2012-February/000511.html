&gt;<i> The horse is still breathing&#8230; just a few more whacks should do&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> since when learning how to hack and exploit security issues is bad
</I>&gt;<i> examples?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Teaching hacking and exploiting requires the presence of bad code. And
</I>&gt;<i> that's the whole point. Learning to exploit SQL injection requires us to
</I>&gt;<i> show students software that is missing everything we want them to learn.
</I>&gt;<i> Knowing that the software is broken does not inform us on what would fix
</I>&gt;<i> it. It simply tells us that we must fix it. How one writes software
</I>&gt;<i> correctly is an entirely different question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It takes real skill, focus, determination, knowledge and passion to find
</I>&gt;<i> and exploit those issues. It's much more like detective work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Teaching the right way to do things is orthogonal to teaching them passion
</I>&gt;<i> and craftsmanship. You can be passionate about making code that is very,
</I>&gt;<i> very correct. Or you can be passionate about breaking and exploiting
</I>&gt;<i> things. One need not sacrifice passion and craftsmanship in order to teach
</I>&gt;<i> doing the right thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are discussing what to do with an ICT curriculum in schools, when youth
</I>&gt;<i> have little to no computer science or development background. They need to
</I>&gt;<i> learn the correct thing first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NO, absolutely not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They need to learn passion and love and craftsmanship first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I respect this and I agree. I just don't see how hacking and exploiting is
</I>&gt;<i> craftsmanship, whereas building correct software correctly is not. Nor do I
</I>&gt;<i> see how one teaches either of these things (correctness or passion) to the
</I>&gt;<i> exclusion of the other. The two things are unrelated. For every hacker you
</I>&gt;<i> can point to who is passionate about his craft, I can find an equally
</I>&gt;<i> talented developer whose code is solid because he is passionate about doing
</I>&gt;<i> it right. There is no opposition between these two goals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider spelling. One does not teach spelling by providing a long list of
</I>&gt;<i> misspelled words to children who don't yet know how to spell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> sorry, but actually you do :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a 6 and 8 year old and just saw this happening in front of me. In
</I>&gt;<i> the beginning the teachers are much more focused on getting the kid
</I>&gt;<i> interested in reading books, and they are not that bothered if the kid
</I>&gt;<i> reads the wrong word. The key is that the kid learns to like reading.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have kids the same ages. When they practice reading, we are putting
</I>&gt;<i> correctly spelled words in front of them over and over and over again. We
</I>&gt;<i> don't teach them spelling at all until after they have spent years
</I>&gt;<i> (hopefully) looking at lots and lots of correctly spelled words.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Correct spelling actually comes after reading, where once the kid starts
</I>&gt;<i> to learn how to sound things, he/she is thought the gramatical rules and
</I>&gt;<i> eventually have speling tests on blocks of words. Even then, the teachers
</I>&gt;<i> will reward kids that make good efforts and write down a spelling that
</I>&gt;<i> phonetically is equivalent
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, no disagreement. But my oldest has not yet come home with a
</I>&gt;<i> homework assignment saying &quot;Some of these words are misspelled. Which
</I>&gt;<i> ones?&quot; Nor has he come home with a sheet of incorrect and correct words,
</I>&gt;<i> where the incorrectly spelled ones are identified for him. We start putting
</I>&gt;<i> a mixture of correctly and incorrectly spelled words in front of children
</I>&gt;<i> only after years of exclusively showing them correctly spelled words.
</I>&gt;<i> That's educational theory being put to practice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is what teaching hacking would be. It's putting good and bad software
</I>&gt;<i> in front of a student and asking them to see the distinction. When they're
</I>&gt;<i> in secondary school or university, they don't have that capability, yet.
</I>&gt;<i> They don't know enough about software to understand which bits are good and
</I>&gt;<i> which are bad.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We shouldn't show students broken software and talk about fixing it, until
</I>&gt;<i> we have shown them lots and lots of good software and good practices they
</I>&gt;<i> should emulate. Bad software is everywhere. Good software, that we might
</I>&gt;<i> point to and say &quot;go do it that way&quot;, is in desperately short supply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that I had a LOT of teachers at university and college that used
</I>&gt;<i> those techniques, and I learned more about computers trying to write C++
</I>&gt;<i> and Assembly to play tricks on my colleges, than I ever did via the
</I>&gt;<i> 'building good foundations' way
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I obviously can't argue what worked for you. What I appeal to is
</I>&gt;<i> educational theory. Most people fall under the wide part of the bell curve
</I>&gt;<i> and they need something a lot more basic that gets them good enough.
</I>&gt;<i> Educational theory, which is all about doing the right thing for the
</I>&gt;<i> majority, says you teach the right thing first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hacking and exploiting are cool in the way that graffiti and vandalism are
</I>&gt;<i> cool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is your pre-conceived ideas of hacking, and maybe this is where we
</I>&gt;<i> have to part ways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you study history you will see that most computing advances were
</I>&gt;<i> created by hacking activities, and reducing it to 'vandalism' is bringing
</I>&gt;<i> down this conversation to a very low level.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we're going to quote movies, like Dennis did, I'll quote Star Wars:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Stay on target&#8230; stay on target&#8230;&quot;. I'm not suggesting things that will
</I>&gt;<i> advance the field nor am I putting up stumbling blocks for those who would.
</I>&gt;<i> I am answering the question of what we should teach everyone. What is the
</I>&gt;<i> baseline we teach to? Hacking and exploitation are, as I said, destructive.
</I>&gt;<i> They are not the kind of thing you teach everyone because they don't lead
</I>&gt;<i> you to creating better software in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You cannot 'hack' me an enterprise-grade transaction processing system
</I>&gt;<i> that meets stringent standards of reliability, accuracy, performance,
</I>&gt;<i> security, etc. If you produce one of those things, then the activity you're
</I>&gt;<i> doing is not 'hacking'. You cannot 'exploit' your way to a robust auth/auth
</I>&gt;<i> system. If you produce a valid, correct, and reliable auth/auth system, you
</I>&gt;<i> do it through processes that no one would call 'exploitation'. Thus if the
</I>&gt;<i> goal we are trying to achieve is producing correct software that is secure,
</I>&gt;<i> reliable, and meeting business goals, then teaching 'hacking' and
</I>&gt;<i> 'exploiting' would be teaching activities that do not lead to that result.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They are destructive activities that cannot, on their own, create
</I>&gt;<i> something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe in science they call this 'experimentation' , 'validation' and
</I>&gt;<i> 'peer-review'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those are fine processes. You neither 'validate' nor 'peer review' in
</I>&gt;<i> order to create. Maybe a more palatable word is to say they refine, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than destroy. Either way, they don't help the creator on his first draft.
</I>&gt;<i> They only help the creator in subsequent drafts (be that a scientific
</I>&gt;<i> paper, or software). We need to help people make their first draft better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Experimentation is fine, but we're not suffering from a shortage of
</I>&gt;<i> experimental, half-baked software. We're suffering from a shortage of
</I>&gt;<i> rock-solid, mission-accomplishing, reliable, secure software. I don't want
</I>&gt;<i> to dampen anyone's creative spirit. But when it's time to move that idea
</I>&gt;<i> out of the garage and onto the market, it has to be built differently. We
</I>&gt;<i> need to know that the average person you're interviewing, who came through
</I>&gt;<i> a regular ICT program, will have a clue about building software well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The original question was around what should be taught to every person
</I>&gt;<i> learning ICT. I still maintain that hacking and exploitation have little
</I>&gt;<i> value there. The majority of average people in the middle of the bell curve
</I>&gt;<i> will gain nothing by it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People need to learn to create well. That, indeed, is craftsmanship.
</I>&gt;<i> Loving to create great and beautiful things is a very good goal. Learning
</I>&gt;<i> how beautiful things can be exploited or ruined is of little value in
</I>&gt;<i> achieving that goal. It is not something everyone needs to learn.
