<PRE>The horse is still breathing&#8230; just a few more whacks should do&#8230;

since when learning how to hack and exploit security issues is bad examples?

Teaching hacking and exploiting requires the presence of bad code. And that's the whole point. Learning to exploit SQL injection requires us to show students software that is missing everything we want them to learn. Knowing that the software is broken does not inform us on what would fix it. It simply tells us that we must fix it. How one writes software correctly is an entirely different question.

It takes real skill, focus, determination, knowledge and passion to find and exploit those issues. It's much more like detective work.

Teaching the right way to do things is orthogonal to teaching them passion and craftsmanship. You can be passionate about making code that is very, very correct. Or you can be passionate about breaking and exploiting things. One need not sacrifice passion and craftsmanship in order to teach doing the right thing.

We are discussing what to do with an ICT curriculum in schools, when youth
have little to no computer science or development background. They need to
learn the correct thing first.

NO, absolutely not.

They need to learn passion and love and craftsmanship first.

I respect this and I agree. I just don't see how hacking and exploiting is craftsmanship, whereas building correct software correctly is not. Nor do I see how one teaches either of these things (correctness or passion) to the exclusion of the other. The two things are unrelated. For every hacker you can point to who is passionate about his craft, I can find an equally talented developer whose code is solid because he is passionate about doing it right. There is no opposition between these two goals.

Consider spelling. One does not teach spelling by providing a long list of
misspelled words to children who don't yet know how to spell.

sorry, but actually you do :)

I have a 6 and 8 year old and just saw this happening in front of me. In the beginning the teachers are much more focused on getting the kid interested in reading books, and they are not that bothered if the kid reads the wrong word. The key is that the kid learns to like reading.

We have kids the same ages. When they practice reading, we are putting correctly spelled words in front of them over and over and over again. We don't teach them spelling at all until after they have spent years (hopefully) looking at lots and lots of correctly spelled words.

Correct spelling actually comes after reading, where once the kid starts to learn how to sound things, he/she is thought the gramatical rules and eventually have speling tests on blocks of words. Even then, the teachers will reward kids that make good efforts and write down a spelling that phonetically is equivalent

Again, no disagreement. But my oldest has not yet come home with a homework assignment saying &quot;Some of these words are misspelled. Which ones?&quot; Nor has he come home with a sheet of incorrect and correct words, where the incorrectly spelled ones are identified for him. We start putting a mixture of correctly and incorrectly spelled words in front of children only after years of exclusively showing them correctly spelled words. That's educational theory being put to practice.

That is what teaching hacking would be. It's putting good and bad software in front of a student and asking them to see the distinction. When they're in secondary school or university, they don't have that capability, yet. They don't know enough about software to understand which bits are good and which are bad.

We shouldn't show students broken software and talk about fixing it, until we have shown them lots and lots of good software and good practices they should emulate. Bad software is everywhere. Good software, that we might point to and say &quot;go do it that way&quot;, is in desperately short supply.

Note that I had a LOT of teachers at university and college that used those techniques, and I learned more about computers trying to write C++ and Assembly to play tricks on my colleges, than I ever did via the 'building good foundations' way

I obviously can't argue what worked for you. What I appeal to is educational theory. Most people fall under the wide part of the bell curve and they need something a lot more basic that gets them good enough. Educational theory, which is all about doing the right thing for the majority, says you teach the right thing first.


Hacking and exploiting are cool in the way that graffiti and vandalism are cool.

That is your pre-conceived ideas of hacking, and maybe this is where we have to part ways.

If you study history you will see that most computing advances were created by hacking activities, and reducing it to 'vandalism' is bringing down this conversation to a very low level.

If we're going to quote movies, like Dennis did, I'll quote Star Wars: &quot;Stay on target&#8230; stay on target&#8230;&quot;. I'm not suggesting things that will advance the field nor am I putting up stumbling blocks for those who would. I am answering the question of what we should teach everyone. What is the baseline we teach to? Hacking and exploitation are, as I said, destructive. They are not the kind of thing you teach everyone because they don't lead you to creating better software in the first place.

You cannot 'hack' me an enterprise-grade transaction processing system that meets stringent standards of reliability, accuracy, performance, security, etc. If you produce one of those things, then the activity you're doing is not 'hacking'. You cannot 'exploit' your way to a robust auth/auth system. If you produce a valid, correct, and reliable auth/auth system, you do it through processes that no one would call 'exploitation'. Thus if the goal we are trying to achieve is producing correct software that is secure, reliable, and meeting business goals, then teaching 'hacking' and 'exploiting' would be teaching activities that do not lead to that result.


They are destructive activities that cannot, on their own, create something.

I believe in science they call this 'experimentation' , 'validation' and 'peer-review'.

Those are fine processes. You neither 'validate' nor 'peer review' in order to create. Maybe a more palatable word is to say they refine, rather than destroy. Either way, they don't help the creator on his first draft. They only help the creator in subsequent drafts (be that a scientific paper, or software). We need to help people make their first draft better.

Experimentation is fine, but we're not suffering from a shortage of experimental, half-baked software. We're suffering from a shortage of rock-solid, mission-accomplishing, reliable, secure software. I don't want to dampen anyone's creative spirit. But when it's time to move that idea out of the garage and onto the market, it has to be built differently. We need to know that the average person you're interviewing, who came through a regular ICT program, will have a clue about building software well.

The original question was around what should be taught to every person learning ICT. I still maintain that hacking and exploitation have little value there. The majority of average people in the middle of the bell curve will gain nothing by it.

People need to learn to create well. That, indeed, is craftsmanship. Loving to create great and beautiful things is a very good goal. Learning how beautiful things can be exploited or ruined is of little value in achieving that goal. It is not something everyone needs to learn.
