<PRE>Do members offer to redo talks at other venues such as LUG meets?
I may covering old ground but...

I know some LUGs have a hard time finding talks at this time of the year and
even a &quot;web security basics&quot; would go down well :-)

Surrey and Hants peroidically do/did a joint meeting so you could have an
audience of 30-60+ and not that far from London. I am sure other LUGs
would be amenable to similar talks.

Finally, in the past LUGs have had &quot;product/company&quot; talks from prospective
employers so if you are looking to hire please consider attending a local
LUG - there are *some* skilled folks and quite a few of the more dedicated
students attending these events and some already in work can be tempted away
- I have seen it happen more than once :-)
