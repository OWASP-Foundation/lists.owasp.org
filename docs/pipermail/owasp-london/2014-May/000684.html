<PRE>All,

Just to remind you all, our next meeting is this Thursday at our new venue sponsor for the year, Skype, at their offices at 2 Waterhouse Square, 140 Holborn, London, EC1N 2ST.  Talks are scheduled to start at 6:30pm, but we can all arrive from around 6pm, and there should be plenty of time for networking (and grabbing pizza and drinks) before and between the talks.

*** RSVPs close tomorrow evening to we can get names on the door - RSVP now if you&#8217;re coming! ***

As previously noted, the lineup has changed as Rick Doten can&#8217;t make it (we&#8217;ll look to reschedule with him), but I think you&#8217;ll agree that the replacement talk will both be very interesting and timely for you all!

Talks

&#8226; Heartbleed Teardown - Hacker Fantastic
An analysis of CVE-2014-0160 (&quot;heartbleed&quot;) covering detailed assessment of the vulnerability since it's introduction to OpenSSL on NYE 2011. The talk will also cover exploitation notes and detailed usage scenarios from an attackers perspective. We will discuss exploit development processes, traffic analysis and signature creation by IDS/IPS vendors as well as interesting things learned during exploitation. A demonstration of the vulnerability being exploited and its implications within multiple scenarios will also be performed.

&#8226; AppSensor 2.0 - Colin Watson
The AppSensor Project defines the concept of application-specific real time attack detection and response. A new AppSensor Guide book has been written to document the cumulative knowledge of the project's contributors, to provide illustrative case studies, and most importantly to showcase several demonstration working implementations. In this presentation Colin Watson will summarise the concept, bring the topic up-to-date, explain alternative architectural models, discuss the newly published implementation guide, demonstrate application security dashboards, and explain the code and web services implementations that attendees will be able to use immediately in their own projects.

Speakers

&#8226; Hacker Fantastic
Hacker Fantastic is a white hat who enjoys writing software, tinkering with computers and everything security related. He has been extensively researching computer security topics for over 10 years and has a deep interest in offensive security techniques.

&#8226; Colin Watson
