For those of you in London who have heard me speak about OWASP
Cornucopia security requirements identification card game, it has been
shortlisted in the Nominet Internet Awards 2014.

Cornucopia is in the "Making the internet a safer place" category:

The entry is here:

There is an awards ceremony at the London Film Museum this evening, at
which we will find out the judges' decisions. There is also a
reception at the House of Commons next week for all shortlisted
entries.

There are some other strong contenders in the category such as the
Internet Watch Foundation's International Reporting Solution, and
Safer Internet Day 2014. The prize? Just some recognition and
publicity.

I'll let you know how we get on. Follow @Nominet and hashtag #nia2014
for live information.

Cornucopia didn't win in its category, but it was did raise some
awareness about OWASP.

The winners are listed here http://nia.nominet.org.uk/winners-2014

All,

As you may have thought (not having seen an announcement!) we?re going to be cancelling our July 17 meeting as we couldn?t pull everything together in enough time. 

Apologies all - our next meeting is September 18th, so we?re looking to get things organised well in advance this time!

Best regards

Justin
