<PRE>This is the final reminder for our meeting tomorrow.

The meeting will begin at 7pm and end at 9pm. The meeting room will be
available starting with 6.30pm and until 9.30pm. I will be there early
(especially if the weather is decent, as I may be taking photographs of
the area; I have a new 10mm lens that might be well suited for the
surrounding architecture).

Address is as follows:

  KPMG, 39th Floor, One Canada Sq, E14 5AG

There's been a change in the agenda, as I've made room for Yiannis to
talk to us about a new web authentication technique, see below.

1 James Fisher: DirBuster &amp; Beyond

  An introduction to the DirBuster project, detailing how it works, what
  it can do for you, and the direction it will be taking in the future.
  Followed by an introduction to my unreleased project FuzzBuster,
  showing why it's different to other HTTP fuzzes out there.

  DirBuster is a popular OWASP project:

2 Yiannis Pavlosoglou: Web Authentication Combining Single Packet
  Authorization (WACSPA)

  This presentation aims to demonstrate a pioneering way of
  authenticating on a web-site, by means of accessing the login
  interface via port knocking.

  As Single Packet Authorization is beginning to mature as a subject
  discipline, attaching a time window of opportunity towards the
  ability of logging in to a web-site adds an extra layer of security,
  well beyond the remit of the application layer.

  In this presentation, the basic concept will be presented, a system
  description given, as well as a detailed outline of the tools used to
  develop this type of web authentication.
