Subject: [Owasp-london] update on March 9th meeting: "Naked Application Security - A striped back look at the industry today" with special guest Mark Curphey
Message-ID: <12a04fc28152498487d41578a0c61334@ddplus.net>

Hello, here is an updated version of this Thursdays Owasp Meeting in London (now with final address details, a change of running order and other goodies like free books and PodCast)

-------------

On March 9th 2006, Thursday, there will be another Owasp-London Chapter gathering in the Hammersmith 's Auriol Kensington Rowing Club, 4 Lower Mall, Hammersmith, London, W6 9DJ.

Here are pictures of the club's venue http://www.akrowing.com/rebuild_gall.php?race=venue&pic=1, here are detailed instructions to how to get there http://www.akrowing.com/page.php?page=findus (specially important for the ones that will come by tube (Auriol Kensington is between two pubs the Blue Anchor and The Rutland )) and if you are driving you might find this google map useful http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=W6+9DJ&ll=51.489935,-0.231056&spn=0.047885,0.21698

In this session, I am very happy to announce that Owasp founder Mark Curphey will deliver a presentation on the night's topic "Naked Application Security - A striped back look at the industry today". I (Dinis Cruz) will also deliver a presentation on the latest developments at Owasp, the forthcoming European Owasp Conference, and the new Owasp tools SiteGenerator and VulnReport.

So, currently the schedule looks like this:

6:00 pm - Arrive at location, get some beers and food

Subject: [Owasp-london] 'Rooting the CLR' London Presentation
Message-ID: <441F3925.6060303@ddplus.net>

Hello

(For the ones around London) This Wednesday (in two days) I will be
doing my 'Rooting the CLR' presentation to the LondonDotNet group which
is one of the most active London .Net communities.

There are still some places left (the event takes place on Microsoft's
Soho offices), so if you are interested you can get more details here
http://iancooper.brinkster.net/FrontPage.aspx (basically send an email
to meetings at dnug.org.uk telling Ian (the organizer) that you want to
attend).

Here (also available in
http://iancooper.brinkster.net/Pages/UG_Meetings.aspx) are more details
about my presentation (1h) :
/
*Rooting the CLR by Dinis Cruz*
In this presentation Dinis Cruz will show how the .Net Framework can be
modified in real-time using Rootkit-like techniques. This is possible
due to the fundamental security design flaw within the .Net framework
where the entire Framework (i.e. all dlls) are loaded into the .Net
process. This creates a scenario where there is nothing stopping a
malicious Full Trust .Net assembly or unmanaged code executed in that
process to 'patch' the CLR itself.

Demos include:
     - CLR patch that allows calls to private methods to succeed
     - CLR patch that allows corrupted Strong Named assemblies to be
executed (i.e. ILDASM a signed .Net assembly, change it, ILASM it back
into .exe format, and execute it without any exception been thrown)
     - Load core .Net framework dlls that come from directories under my
control (for example c:\fusion.dll)
     - MSIL Patch on all Deny and Demand methods so that they always
return without any exception being thrown, which disables most CAS
protections in the running assembly (the only caveat with this demo is
that the 'MSIL patch' must be applied before those methods are JITED)
     - Extra demo: Unpathed ILDASM / ILASM buffer overflow

/There will also be another presentation on the night made by Francis
Norton on the topic* Using of XSLT to generate code from XML* (1 hr)

Hope to some of you there.

Important note: there is free pizza and we always end up in a local bar
for some drinks :)

Message-ID: <85e1ef573cda4a9a9474c2a5db121d7f@ddplus.net>

Ok, here is the 2nd beta of the Owasp SiteGenerator tool (whose  Open Source  development has been sponsored by Foundstone)

You can download the latest version from here:
 Website installer: http://www.ddplus.net/projects/FoundStone/21-March-2006/SiteGenerator_IIS_Website_Setup v0.70.msi
 Gui Installer:  http://www.ddplus.net/projects/FoundStone/21-March-2006/Owasp SiteGenerator v0.70.msi Some installation and configuration notes (which you only need to do once):
 Before you install the website do this (assuming a windows 2003 image)
 Create a new Application pool, call it SiteGeneratorSystemAppPool), and configure it to run under System Create a new website and point it to a local directory (the website instalation files will be copied here) Configure the new website to run Asp.Net 2.0 Create a new Application in that website and set the application pool to SiteGeneratorSystemAppPool Add a IIS wildcard Application Mapping (accessible via Home Directory -> Configuration) to  C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_isapi.dll and untick the 'Verify that file exists' Make sure Default.htm is one of the files included in the default document list (in the 'Documents' tab) Configure the Website's IP Address to be 127.0.0.1, and click on the Advanced button to add a new host header mapping IPAddress: 127.0.0.1
 TCP Port: 80 
 Host Header Value: SiteGenerator
 Install the WebSite (selecting as the target the website created in the previous step) Install the GUI Add this line to your hosts file (located in C:\window\system32\drivers\etc\hosts)
 SiteGenerator        127.0.0.1 
 Click on the SiteGenerator link that was placed on your desktop If all goes well you now can browse to http://SiteGenerator or http://127.0.0.1 (depending if you did the mappings or not) and see the default SiteGenerator's website

Note that the SQL Injection vulnerabilites expect that you have HacmeBank installed in your box.

So install SiteGenerator in one of your test images and let me know how it went.

Also if you are interested in helping in the develpment of SiteGenerator or in its vulnerabiltiy database, then contact me directly.

Subject: [Owasp-london] Podcasting, how to record a presentation?
Message-ID: <441F5F66.5000903@ddplus.net>

I wanted to record my 'Rooting the CLR' LondonDotNet presentation and
Podcast it.

So given the failed attempt to record the London Owasp Chapter meeting
(my fault), I decided to ask for some help, does anybody on this list
has experience in recording audio for Podcasting (note that I have a Mac
Powerbook G4 (OsX 10.4) which I can use to record and process the audio)

Thanks

All you need to do is record the audio side and save that as a mp3.  
Then its a case of creating the podcast XML file and uploading it  
somewhere (or publishing it to the iTunes server for exposure)

Message-ID: <442095A6.1010506@ddplus.net>

Hello,

The voting for DDD3 has begun (DDD is the DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper
event) and this year the number of potential presentations is ever higher.

You can see them here http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/votesessions.asp
and you can vote for the ones that you want to see.

I proposed two talks:

    - Rooting the CLR   (Style: Presentation - Level: 400) - In this
presentation Dinis Cruz will show how the .Net Framework can be modified
in real-time using Rootkit-like techniques. This is possible due to the
fundamental security design flaw within the .Net framework where the
entire Framework (i.e. all dlls) are loaded into the .Net process. This

   - Attacking Web and Windows Applications   (Style: Presentation -
Level: 400) - In this session (a variation of the one delivered in DDD2)
multiple attack vectors will be shown covering a wide variety of
vulnerabilities and exploits: Sql Injection (basic and advanced), XSS
(session hijacking and remote command execution), Elevation of
Privilege, Web Services exploitation, AJAX exploitation, Rootkits (user
and kernel level), attacking fat-clients by hooking into windows functi...

So you can vote for me if you want to see them (they are recorded and

Subject: [Owasp-london] Owasp SiteGenerator v0.70 (public beta release)
Message-ID: <4429E257.4050403@ddplus.net>

After much development and hard work here is the first stable (beta)
release of the new Owasp SiteGenerator tool (whose Open Source
development has been sponsored by Foundstone)

Owasp SiteGenerator allows the creating of dynamic websites based on XML
files and predefined vulnerabilities (some simple to detect/exploit,
some harder) covering multiple .Net languages and web development
architectures (for example, navigation: Html, Javascript, Flash, Java,
etc...).

SiteGenerator can be used on the following projects:

    - Evaluation of Web Application Security Scanners
    - Evaluation of Web Application Firewalls
    - Developer Training
    - Web Honeypots
    - Web Application hacking contests (or evaluations)

You can read an introduction to this tool here
(http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=14547158), and
download the latest version from here:

    * Website installer:
      http://www.ddplus.net/projects/FoundStone/21-March-2006/SiteGenerator_IIS_Website_Setup
      v0.70.msi
    * Gui Installer:
      http://www.ddplus.net/projects/FoundStone/21-March-2006/Owasp
      SiteGenerator v0.70.msi

Some installation and configuration notes (which you only need to do once):

    * Before you install the website do this (assuming a windows 2003 image)
          o Create a new Application pool, call it
            SiteGeneratorSystemAppPool), and configure it to run under
            System
          o Create a new website and point it to a local directory (the
            website installation files will be copied here)
          o Configure the new website to run Asp.Net 2.0
          o Create a new Application in that website and set the
            application pool to SiteGeneratorSystemAppPool
          o Add a IIS wildcard Application Mapping (accessible via Home
            Directory -> Configuration) to 
            C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_isapi.dll
            and untick the 'Verify that file exists'
          o Make sure Default.htm is one of the files included in the
            default document list (in the 'Documents' tab)
          o Configure the Website's IP Address to be 127.0.0.1, and
            click on the Advanced button to add a new host header mapping
                + IPAddress: 127.0.0.1
                + TCP Port: 80
                + Host Header Value: SiteGenerator
    * Install the WebSite (selecting as the target the website created
      in the previous step)
    * Install the GUI
    * Add this line to your hosts file (located in
      C:\window\system32\drivers\etc\hosts)
          o SiteGenerator        127.0.0.1
    * Click on the SiteGenerator link that was placed on your desktop

If all goes well you now can browse to http://SiteGenerator or
http://127.0.0.1 (depending if you did the mappings or not) and see the
default SiteGenerator's website. If you see a blank page, try
http://127.0.0.1/Default.htm (you might be getting a cached version of
http://127.0.0.1)

Note that the SQL Injection vulnerabilities expect that you have the
latest version of HacmeBank (v2.0) installed in your box.

I am in the process of creating several videos (covering the
installation and GUI) which I am sure will be very useful and practical.
Also if you are interested in helping in the development of
SiteGenerator or in its vulnerabilities database, then contact me directly.

Subject: [Owasp-london] On sandboxes, and why you should care
Message-ID: <442BA1D8.9020700@ddplus.net>

On 29/03/06, Andrew van der Stock <vanderaj at greebo.net> wrote:
> Hi there,

Hello Andrew,

As a response to your post, I will try to clarify why I believe that
Sandboxes are a fundamental piece in the security of Web Applications,
the hosting server(s) and the datacenter.

First of all, there are two issues with Verification. The first is
that you need verifiable code in both .Net and Java in order to run
that code in a Sandbox (Partial trust in .Net). The 2nd one is that if
you remove verification from the security benefits of .Net and Java,
and you admit that that is OK (which seems to be the current position
today), then you just eliminated some of the biggest security and
reliability features of these 'managed environments' (you also have
the problem that when (not if) you move your code to a secure sandbox
you will have many more problems to deal with (from performance to
unverifiable code issues))

Really???  I am not so sure.

Lets look at some of your assets: The J2EE application, the supporting
database, the server(s) hosting your environment, the data center,
that companies internal network, the users (end-clients) and all users
(end-clients) that use all websites hosted in that data center (add to
this mix, items like: company public profile/confidence, customer's
private data, data privacy and SoX laws,  and end up with a complex
multilayer mesh of assets)

Now, there are different levels of compromise here (I will just list some)

- J2EE application compromise
- Database compromise
- Web Server compromise
- Database server compromise
- Data center compromise

One of the main benefits of what I am defending (Sandboxing the
execution of code) is that you are able to dramatically limit the
damage created by (for example) malicious code executed on the
application's process space.

So for example, the damage of a file upload vulnerability (which
allows you to put a *.jsp file on the server and execute it) is
limited to the permissions allocated to the Sandbox.

The reality is that if you don't run that code with ANY sandbox, then
your entire Application, Server and Datacenter security is dependent
of the non existence of any malicious code in all applications running
on all web servers.

Also remember that more and more we will have to deal with malicious
developers, or with malicious attackers that are able to inject
malicious code into a website via:
    - a library used by a developer
    - a compromised developer account details (which tend to be sent by
email)
    - a compromised developer computer (infected via Spyware) which
allows the malicious attacker to control remotely that computer and
(for example) path Eclipse or Visual Studio in memory so that every
time a piece of code its submitted (checked-in) , the malicious
payloads are inserted.

If you add up the number of people that have the capability to put one
line of malicious code on a web server, you will see that this is a
very large number indeed.

A couple more examples of ways malicious code can be uploaded to the
server: SQL Injection, XSS (payload deployed to the admin section),
authorization vulnerabilities which allow the editing of files on the
server (via for example the CMS (content management system)),
manipulating params which control which method is executed (when
Reflection is used to perform late binding on method calls based on
the commands received) ,Social engineering, etc...

Sometimes you will even find CMS (Content Management Systems) that
provide power users (or 'area x' admins) with powerful customization
features which when exploited (or not, depending if this is a
'feature') allow the injection of code.

Do you really think that it is a good idea to have your entire data
center security and CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability)
depended on such extraordinary set of circumstances?

So the first main security benefit that we have with using Sandboxes
is: Containment, Damage Limitation, and Risk Reduction (you went from
full data center compromise to a local and limited problem)

Note: the reason that I say data center compromise, is because most
(if not all) data centers (and even corporate networks) are not
designed to sustain an attack executed from inside (especially when
the malicious attacker as admin control over one server)

Sure, but out of those 100, how many allow remote command execution or
upload of scripts to the server?

So ironically, you could find your self in a position where the first
thing you should do (from a security point of view) would be to
isolate that server/application so that a compromise of that
application is limited to that application's assets.

Well that depends on what those issues are, but I agree with you that
converting existing applications designed to run outside a sandbox,
into 'Sandboxable' applications, is a massive project.

Also note that just turning on the verifier is not good enough.  You
will need other protection layers.

What other Protection layers I am talking about? For example: "Offline
or realtime code profiling and analysis"

One of the reasons why I strongly believe that Full Trust code (and
the Java --noverify) should be verifiable, is because if it was, I
could analyse (offline and in real time) that code for security
problems and block its execution when malicious code is detected.

If the code is verifiable, I am able to make a series of security
decisions (with a high degree to certainty) based on the the 'risk
profile' of that code. For example: Does it make calls to unmanaged
code, does make calls to private members using reflection, does start
processes, etc...

If the code is not verifiable then It is as good as trying to analyse
a C++ binary (you basically will have no ability to make hard
decisions because you just can't predict what is inside that binary
(or unverifiable code)). Which is the reason why signature based
Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware applications are very bad at detecting new
virus, exploits or attacks.

So the 2nd security advantage that Verifiable code gives you is: Allow
Security decisions to be made based on pre-execution or real-time code
analysis / checks.

In the current environment yes (because these applications where
designed to run with maximum privileges), but when (not if) the
applications are designed (or modified) to run in sandboxes, then the
cost of changing them to run on 'secure run-time environments' will be
more acceptable. Which is one of the reasons why the sooner
Sandboxable code starts to be created the better.

> How much has been lost with this attack? Ever?

Well, that depends on how you measure this cost?

Remember for example, that the reason why most Buffer Overflows are so
dangerous is because the payload is executed outside a sandbox :)

So I can argue that a vulnerability that allows remote .Net or Java
code to be executed on the victim, is as dangerous as a Buffer
Overflow.

And I think there have some some financial losses out there due to
Buffer Overflows exploits, don't you agree?  :)

Take for example the latest Microsoft Office Buffer Overflow
vulnerabilities. Which one is more dangerous, a Word file with such
exploit (and payload) or a Word file with that payload injected inside
a Macro? (note that in Office 2003, Macros are .Net assemblies which
require Full Trust to execute). The risk profile is about the same for
both, since both have a 90% chance of being executed.

I have (but can't talk about it). Humm, where do you see a 'trust
model on the underlying VM'? If you are running with Full Trust or
--noverify, the only 'trust model' that exists is the same one that
exists for unmanaged (C++) applications (for example OS based ACL
restrictions)

But if you want a very good public example, look at the PHP XML-RPC
worms which do exactly that. They use a vulnerability in a
application's feature, to upload code to the server and execute it
from the inside (in most cases making those computer boot-net zombies
used to launch other attacks)

If these PHP applications were running inside a sandbox, then this
worm would have never been possible if that Sandbox (for example) did
not allow direct outbound connections.

> Has it lost anyone any

Money yes, reputation and shareholder confidence, not really.

There is a small number of public disclosure of this type of attacks,
and the media doesn't tend to report that the problem is 'lack of
Sandboxing' (see the coverage on the PHP XML-RPC worm)

> I'm happy to hear if

Sometimes all it takes is to look at reality with another perspective.

After my explanations, do you still think that this is a non-issue

Well I strongly disagree that this 'risk doesn't really rate', but
since we are talking about 'devland'. let me give you my final reason
why I believe the development of verifiable and sandboxable code is so
important.

And the reason is: To allow privilege separation and to make source
code audits practical and accountable.

Lets take typical source-code security audit project. You get given an
application (App A) that has 500,000 lines of code (executed with Full
Trust or with --noverify), and you are given 1 week to: understand the
app, audit the code, find vulnerabilities, write proof of concepts and
write your report.

Now, if you need to look at every single one of those 500,000 lines of
code, can you really do it in that time frame?

No way.

Can you provide a strong level of assurance to your client that that
application has no major vulnerabilities?

No way, because you known that all you need is 1 vulnerable method
inside that 500,000 block of code, to compromise the entire solution.

So let's look at another application (App B) which has the same
functionality but, is executed in three Sandboxes:

 - Sandbox A) 450,000 lines of code executed in very restricted
Sandbox (let's say Asp.Net Low Trust)

  - Sandbox B) 48,000 lines of code executed in secure Sandbox (let's
say customized version of Asp.Net Medium Trust)

  - Sandbox C) 2,000 lines of code executed in a Sandbox which allows
calls to unmanaged code.

Given the same 1 week, you (as the security consultant auditing this
application) will spend most of your time in Sandbox C) code, less on
Sandbox B) code and even less on Sandbox A) code. Why? because only a
vulnerability in Sandbox C) would allow the compromise of the entire
App / Server / Datacenter.

More importantly, a vulnerability which in Sandbox A) you would mark
with a Critical Risk rating, in App A (due to the different DREAD
score) you would marked it with a Low Risk rating. Same code,
different Sandboxes, different Risk Profiles :)

And this brings me back to my frustration with the current status quo
(which is to write everything for Full Trust / --noverify
environments), because we already have working solutions that allow
the creation of applications like App B. What we don't have is
awareness, focus, commitment and client pressure to do it.

If today there is a good understanding / acknowledgment that
applications that need to be executed with Admin or System privileges
is not good security practices, then let's extend this and realise
that that Full Trust / --noverify code is also as bad.

I strongly believe that only when the majority (and eventually all)
applications we use look like App B (or even App C with 100% code
execution in a secure sandbox) we will have  trustworthy computing
environments.

No problem

Hope my explanations make sense

Subject: [Owasp-london] [Owasp-world] Reminder: 2006 European OWASP AppSec Conference - May 30-31, 2006 near Brussels
Message-ID: <02db01c650e0$f9251050$1204a8c0@intranet.aspectsecurity.com>

Dear Colleague,

OWASP is holding its annual European AppSec (Application Security)
Conference May 30-31, 2006 at the Catholic University of Leuven (aka
Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, or K.U. Leuven) in Leuven, which is 25 km
from Brussels.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES: Early registration for the conference ends April 30.
The reduced rates for the conference hotels ends mid to late April depending
on the hotel.

AGENDA: This conference has dual tracks like last years' US conference. The
speakers and agenda are available on the OWASP website at:

             http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe.html.

This year's speakers include popular speakers from previous conferences like
Dinis Cruz and Ivan Ristic, but also includes many new speakers to the OWASP
Conference, including Andrew Van Der Stock (project lead for the OWASP
Guide), Roger Thornton (CTO of Fortify), Mike Andrews of Foundstone, and
myself (Dave Wichers - COO of Aspect Security).

NEW: We also have introduced for the first time two panels, which should
generate some lively debate. The first panel is on "Should companies be
emulating Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)?" and the 2nd is
on: "Are we winning the war?" - Are we actually getting a handle on
application security issues and making things better, or are things still
getting worse?

REGISTRATION DETAILS: Registration is open and the conference fee is 300
Euros for early registration and 350 Euros for registrations after April 30,
2006.

TUTORIALS - May 29, 2006:

OWASP has arranged to have two one-day tutorials the day prior to the
conference. These one day tutorials will be held at the university and are
only 600 Euros for conference attendees.

FOUNDATIONS OF APPLICATION SECURITY COURSE: This powerful hands on course
focuses on the most common web application security problems, including the
OWASP Top Ten. The course introduces and demonstrates hacking techniques,
illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students
really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities into their
code. 

WEB SERVICES and XML SECURITY: The movement towards Web Services and Service
Oriented architecture (SOA) paradigms requires new security paradigms to
deal with new risks posed by these architectures. This session takes a
pragmatic approach towards identifying Web Services security risks and
selecting and applying countermeasures to the application, code, web
servers, databases, application, and identity servers and related software.

More details on these training courses are available at:

        http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe/training.html 

EVENING SOCIAL EVENT - May 30, 2006: The traditional evening dinner/social
event is being held at the nearby Faculty Club. The Faculty club is a
restaurant annex conference centre located in a medieval part of Leuven. We
can walk there from the conference, and will have a social hour followed by
a 3-course dinner. Dinner is typically followed by drinks nearby. The dinner
event is 40 Euros.

HOTELS - We have arranged for conference rates at nearby hotels. Many of
these rates expire mid to late April, so please book early. More information
is available at:

 
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2006europe/accommodations.html 

If you know others that would be interested in attending this OWASP
conference, please forward them this email and let them know about this
opportunity.

Please contact me with any questions. Looking forward to seeing you there!

Thanks, Dave
