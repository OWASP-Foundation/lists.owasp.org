Subject: [Owasp-london] Speaking at LSCC (18th Feb) on "New Era of Software
 with modern Application Security"
Message-ID: <CA+f=kXAJ75W2Lc7obpAR+z5WwnYvAmi_vhB-RBjPkgY4hLZqCA@mail.gmail.com>

Since there isn't an OWASP London event happening this month, some of you
might be interested in attending the presentation I'm delivering at
LSCC (London
Software Craftsmanship Community <https://skillsmatter.com/groups/68-lscc>)
on the topic of "New Era of Software with modern Application Security"

You can read the details at
http://blog.diniscruz.com/2016/02/speaking-at-lscc-18th-feb-on-new-era-of.html
and register at https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7845-lscc-talks-feb-2016

Since this is a nice opportunity to reach out to a developer-focused
audience, I wonder if there is any OWASP stuff or books that I could bring.

Any ideas?

Dinis

Subject: [Owasp-london] Scanning tools
Message-ID: <6559CBD8-46BD-4E05-8AC6-8C1947F30692@gmail.com>

Hope you don't mind me asking this on the list but I am interested in feedback on either open source or commercial scanning tools for finding vulnerabilities in Rest and Soap web services and Angular web apps.

I know this list exists: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools but I am interested in feedback from people who have actually used these or other tools.

Any help much appreciated,

Thanks 
Mandy

Are you looking for automated tools?

I'd say the best way to go is to do this kind of test manually.

If you want to do an API assessment, then have a look at this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPrrFNEasgE
(AppSec EU15 - Greg Patton - The API Assessment Primer)

I know many people use Burp Suite Pro+ SOAP UI to do API assessments.

For REST services with older versions of ZAP there was a plugin than can
import WADL's (for testing REST services).
For SOAP services there is a plugin in current Burp suite I think that can
make sense of WSDL's.

If you don't have either and just have documentation to work from then I
suggest you go the route of using SOAP UI. I'm not familiar with the whole
process I've only played around with it.

Goodluck. You can pm me if you have questions about this topic.

Regards.
Timo

'Older versions'??
Its called "SOAP Scanner" and its still available for the latest versions
of ZAP.

For the record, while importing WSDL / WADL or any other API definition
will help you get started, I think the best option is proxying real traffic
through your security tool.
You can do this manually or using functional regression tests. For
automation you'll want to do the latter, and if you dont have any then you
might like to write some ;)

And if anyone has any suggestions as to how we could improve ZAP for
scanning APIs then please let me know.

Cheers,

Simon

If you have access to the application source code or binaries you might also want to think about using a static analysis tool.

Have you ever used Secure, from Smartbear? It is like soap ui (but you have
to pay license). It can automate injection with predefined payloads

Would be good to have something similar in ZAP for APIs

Can you give more details of what it does?
eg a list of vulns it checks for? *
ZAP can (and does) inject payloads into XML and JSON, but I'm sure it could
do much more...

* In addition to what it says on
https://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/secure/overview/ which I've just
found ;)

Here is the overview of the product.
https://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/secure/features/  They offer a 15
days free trial

It is good for security unit tests, and is also good for doing integrated
tests. It worths to check it. At the end of the day, the magic of it is the
predefined payloads and the assertion to validate if the service is
vulnerable or not

PS: Thats a pity we didnt met you at SC Congress... We were there, but we
left before you arrived. Maybe next time :)

Hi, here is the presentation I delivered last night at the OWASP London
Chapter meeting
http://blog.diniscruz.com/2016/02/new-era-of-software-with-modern.html

Please let me know what you think of it, specially about the idea that
*'Application
Security can be used to define and measure Quality'*

Thanks

Thanks Dinis,

My take on it is that not all software quality issues are security issues,
but all software security issues are software quality issues. If thats the
case then security is certainly a measurement of quality.

FYI I am working on getting the video recordings of the talks online over
the weekend.

Dinis, if you have the time I would like to site with you and work on a
deep dive article (with videos) on the topics you discussed today. Would
you be free sometime in March for that?

Thanks Sherif, that is a great comment which I completely agree: "*My take
on it is that not all software quality issues are security issues, but all
software security issues are software quality issues." *

Here is an update that answers the question: Is Quality is a measure of how
successful a product is in what it is SUPPOSED to do?
<http://blog.diniscruz.com/2016/02/is-quality-is-measure-of-how-successful.html>

Sherif, can you post your slides too? They were really interesting in
showing the JIRA workflow you are using at Expedia

And yes, let's work together on a deep dive article on these topics

Would be delighted to share my slides next week.
BTW @Dinis your presentation is up on youtube now :-)

Unfortunately the Battery ran out before the end of the talk but it did
cover most of it.

I had a look at the slides, the talk looks really interesting. I'll try to
watch the video tonight.

Subject: [Owasp-london] Code-driven threat modelling
Message-ID: <CAE_GQbGTS7YzrSE8qZMmA4Wg7+SNgos25oC8MgpyMpBqPcREtQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'd love to hear the opinion from the people on this list about an open
source threat modelling project I started a little while back:

http://threatspec.org

I spoke about it at DevSecCon last year and so far the response has been
amazing.

A guy in the US who has been working on a python parser and I are currently
working on a joint talk that he'll submit to BSidesRoc and I to
BSidesLondon - we're threat modelling the Let's Encrypt client ACME
implementation using ThreatSpec.

Cheers,
Fraser
