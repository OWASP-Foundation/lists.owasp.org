Further to the recent help OWASP London participants provided in
submitting a response to Nominet on its plans for a new domain name
space last year, the results of the consultation can be found:

and briefing on the plan:

The summary includes plenty of wise words, including extracts of
wording written in the OWASP response (and from many other responses)
regarding the proposed security measures such as malware monitoring,
DNSSEC and use of a trustmark.
