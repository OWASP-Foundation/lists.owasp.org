<PRE>Just to remind you that we will be meeting again on December 6th at
the same place as usual, the Auriol Kensington Rowing Club (map
<A HREF="http://www.akrowing.com/page.php?page=findus">http://www.akrowing.com/page.php?page=findus</A>).

The official part will run between 7pm and 9pm, with half an
hour between and after for socialising (the whole event thus
beginning at 6:30pm and ending at 9:30pm). FYI, we are not going
to overrun this time (or ever).

Finding speakers for the meetings has proven to be a challenge
for me so far. PDP has volunteered again to talk about some of
the interesting things they've been doing. But all other people
I have contacted have generally responded that they are too busy.
While I could talk about ModSecurity, I am being very careful not
to abuse my position but if you are interested please let yourselves
be known.

I could use your help to:

 1. Offer to speak about something relevant and interesting.

 2. Find someone with an interesting subject to speak about.

 3. Speak your mind about what you'd like to hear of.

Since we are going to continue to have these meetings quarterly
I think it may be useful to spend some time on every meeting to
discuss what's new in the OWASP world (projects, conferences, etc)
but also what's new in the web application security space (e.g.
new major vulnerabilities, interesting papers, projects, etc). Do
you think this would be a good idea? I am guessing there aren't
many people who can afford to closely follow what's going on.

What do you think?

There's been some talk about the future of OWASP recently. With this
in mind and considering we didn't really spend enough time discussing
the future of the London Chapter on our last meeting, I am going to
dedicate one chunk of the meeting for these two topics.

Finally, I am starting to talk to people about having an OWASP UK
Day, an one-day mini-conference in the first week of March 2008. The
aim is to bring 80-120 people together for an interesting day. Ideally
I'd like such an event to be held twice every year.

Thanks,
Ivan
