<PRE>Apologies all - that should of course say OWASP meeting THIS week (not NEXT week)! :-)

&gt;<i> This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP Central London chapter meeting to be held next week on Thursday November 8th, at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between 6:00pm-6:30pm).  This meeting we have a special treat in the form of well known security researcher and practioner Petko D. Petkov (pdp) talking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We're back at Morgan Stanley who have kindly agreed to let us use their facilities:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Morgan Stanley, 25 Cabot Square, Canary Wharf, London E14 4QA
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note - this is the same building as we were in earlier in the year, this is NOT the building next to the Heron Quays DLR station. Make sure you have a look on Google Maps or similar to make sure you're heading to the right building!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As always, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even though this meeting is free and open to all, if you are planning to attend you must RSVP <A HREF="athttp://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.">athttp://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.</A> Please enter your real name, as this will be given to Morgan Stanley building security. If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close at midday the day before the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in advance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">justin.clarke at owasp.org</A> so your space can be released for someone else.

</I>&gt;<i> ==Talks==
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226; A Short History of The JavaScript Security Arsenal - Petko D. Petkov
</I>&gt;<i> In 2006 we had the first JavaScript port scanner. The same year we saw the incarnation of more advanced tools such as AttackAPI, Carnaval and Backframe. A year later we saw several decent attempts to create complete security tools designed to run with nothing else but web technologies. That was just the start.
</I>&gt;<i> This presentation aims to show the progress that has been made in the past six years in terms of security tools developed entirely with the help of browser technologies. The presentation will take you on a journey through the years, exploring some of the interesting attack techniques used in the past, bringing back some of the important discussions and eventually reaching the culmination when modern tools and technologies will be shown and explained.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226; The continuously evolving threat landscape call CISOs to consider new application security measures, how OWASP can help? - Marco Morana
</I>&gt;<i> The aim of this 20 minute talk is how to introduce Chief Information Security Officers (CISO) to the OWASP Application Security Guide. OWASP has developed a guidance to specifically to address the needs of CISOs to help them in prioritizing the risk mitigation of web application vulnerabilities might severely and negatively impact the organization and jeopardizing the business.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will also give a short update on what's been going on in the OWASP world since our last meeting, if we have time remaining.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ==Speakers==

He is a recognised information security researcher, security tools developer, penetration tester, frequent speaker at industry events, and published author who has contributed to several best-selling books, numerous popular blogs and online magazines. pdp&#8217;s current endeavour is an ambitious project called Websecurify &#8211; a unique web application security testing toolkit designed with simplicity in mind. In his own words: &quot;Websecurify is revolutionising the way we use web application security testing tools, opening a whole new world of possibilities&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	&#8226; Marco Morana
