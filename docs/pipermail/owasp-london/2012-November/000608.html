<PRE>I think much of it is sensible, with a few exceptions:

 *   I don't think a &quot;trust mark&quot; is a good idea. The kinds of stuff they propose to trust and verify are pretty minimal. That is, <A HREF="http://sony.uk/">http://sony.uk/</A> could still spew out tens of millions of accounts, despite all the dnssec and verification. I applaud the use of DNSSEC, but I think putting a visible badge out there will mislead people.
 *   The proposal implicitly connects things like malware with a specific domain and thus the presence of malware with the domain owner's responsibility. I don't think it works like that in the real world. With cloud, shared hosting, and so on, it is possible for malware to originate from a host that happens to service my domain, but it didn't get there through a vulnerability in software I control. If I use a sloppy shared hosting provider and crap on another user's app lets a hacker in, I could find my domain spewing out malware, and then my domain is suspended while it's my problem to prove there's no more malware.

I suppose the false positive problem is addressed by the grace period. The problem with that is that any grace period long enough to be fair in a business context (e.g., 7 days before shutting down a domain) is useless in fighting malware. Malware does much more damage when it first appears, before other services catch it and respond. If a system has been part of the command and control of a botnet for 7 days while the domain owner sorts it out, it has served its purpose. Shorter grace periods, though (like 48 hours) are too quick. They create the possibility that someone's web site is taken offline before they've processed the notice and figured out what to do.

Lastly, the idea that AXFR (which is trivial and meaningless by itself anyways) was allowed on owasp.org two years ago is completely irrelevant. There is no value in dredging that up. It was irrelevant 2 years ago, and it is irrelevant now.

Colin,

Since OWASP has a poor track record related to DNS Security I would recommend that you pursue this independently i.e. <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2010-April/002952.html">https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2010-April/002952.html</A>
