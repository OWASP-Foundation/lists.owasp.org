<PRE>**** We are nearing capacity for this event! Remember to release your slot if you can no longer make it by replying to this email. Also, we've had a slight change of topic for Jim, and he has something even more interesting to talk about! ****

This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP Central London chapter meeting to be held next Thursday (March 29th) at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between 6:00pm-6:30pm).  We have a special treat in the form of an international OWASP Speaker being in town (Jim Manico) who has kindly agreed to speak. 

We're at a new location this time, at Morgan Stanley who have kindly agreed to let us use their facilities:

- Morgan Stanley, 25 Cabot Square, Canary Wharf, London E14 4QA (Wordsworth and Yeats rooms, Level 12)

**** note - this is NOT the Morgan Stanley building you can see from the Jubilee line - make sure you go to the correct building! (off Cabot Square) ****


As always, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

Even though this meeting is free and open to all, if you are planning to attend you must RSVP at <A HREF="http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.">http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.</A> Please enter your real name, as this will be given to Morgan Stanley building security. If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close the day before the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at justin.clarke at owasp.org so your space can be released for someone else.

==Talks==

&#8226; Top Ten Web Defences - Jim Manico
We cannot hack or firewall our way secure. Application programmers need to learn to code in a secure fashion if we have any chance of providing organizations with proper defenses in the current threatscape. This talk will discuss the 10 most important security-centric computer programming techniques necessary to build low-risk web based applications.

&#8226; IronWASP - Manish Saindane
IronWASP (Iron Web application Advanced Security testing Platform) is an open source system for web application vulnerability testing. It is designed to be customizable to the extent where users can create their own custom security scanners using it. Though an advanced user with Python/Ruby scripting expertise would be able to make full use of the platform, a lot of the tool's features are simple enough to be used by absolute beginners.

==Speakers==

&#8226; Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security, a web security firm. Jim is a participant and project manager of the OWASP Developer Cheatsheet series. He is also the producer and host of the OWASP Podcast Series.
&#8226; Manish Saindane is a Senior Security Consultant at Gotham Digital Science. He also co-authors a security research website and blog <A HREF="http://andlabs.org.">http://andlabs.org.</A> He has actively contributed towards conceptualising IronWASP and also maintains the Ruby plug-in repository for this framework.

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the chapter page (<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London</A>).

See you there!

Justin Clarke
