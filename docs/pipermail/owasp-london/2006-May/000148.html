<PRE>Hello All
 
Some of you I know from the limited number of chapter meetings I have
been able to attend, and the rest, hello. 
 
We're recruiting additional people into security here at betfair. The
attached job spec is for the deputy head of security role in case there
are any security professionals interested....
This spec is being sent out to our recruitment agencies so some of you
may already have been contacted by the ones that hoard phone numbers...
but if you are interested just let me know by email with a CV. This is a
permanent role, based in Hammersmith (just up the road from the river
meeting two months ago). Price on application, but market / slightly
higher than market.
 
Not really sure if this is an appropriate use of this forum, but I think
there are few enough opportunities for security professionals to hear
about really interesting roles without then phoning up to be told that
it's a 3month contract or rolling out av in milton keynes....
 
No agencies!
 
Thanks

Adrian Asher
Head of Security
