Hi Guys,

I might need to move the next OWASP London meeting from Thursday 22nd March
to Tuesday 20th March

Anybody has a major problem with that?

Ok, so unfortunately I will not be able to make it on the 22nd (and even on
the 20th).

But the meeting will still take place at the original time and place: 22nd
of March at the The Water Poet Pub, Liverpool St, London (see
map<http://www.beerintheevening.com/cgi-bin/map_link.cgi?id=17986&type=8>and
description<http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/17/17986/Water_Poet/Shoreditch>
)

There is one presentation planned (by Mark O'Neill on "Security
Vulnerabilities in AJAX and Web 2.0" ), and I would like to have another
presentation (any volunteers?).

Sorry for missing this event

Guys,

 

Just a quick mail, there's been a big thread over on another list about
the security of OpenId and I thought I'd get an expert opinion, what's
your take on OpenId?

 

Cheers,

 

Phil.

Hi Phil,

I think that OpenID is a great idea. Personally I would rather have
one account then 20. This way I can at least ensure that this account
is safe enough for daily use. I was planning to write about OpenID
security aspects on GNUCITIZEN but since you ask, I will try to put my
ideas here.

The first most obvious problem with OpenID are the redirection URLs
that send the user to the particular OpenID Service Provider.
Attackers can easily abuse this feature for phising purposes. If users
are not educated about these types of attacks, they can easily fall
into a trap. Consider the following URL:

http://veryimportantbank.com/authenticate.jsp?url=http://212.212.212.212/authenticate

http://212.212.212.212 is some phishing website. Banks will probably
never use OpenID!

The second aspect of the OpenID security is that a single provider
rule all your web accounts. Attackers need to concentrate on one
server to hijack your Internet identity. Given enough time, they will
always find ways to do so. If attackers have your OpenID they will be
able to go everywhere you go, login like you and perform actions on
behalf of you. This is almost like someone stealing your passport or
ID card and replacing your picture with theirs.

Overly, I propose the following principles to secure OpenID.

FOR DEVELOPERS:
When you redirect to a particular OpenID Service provider display a
message to the user saying that they are going to be redirected to a
site that does not belong to you. As such the user should not trust
that site, unless they know what they are doing. Provide the user with
a facility to Accept or Decline the redirection.

Sites should have a database of trusted OpenID providers. It is a good
idea to have some sort of Global Entity which lists verified OpenID
providers. I know that this principle breaks the idea behind OpenID
but like everything else in the computer security world, you have to
find the balance between security and accessibility.

FOR USERS:
Choose OpenID providers that authenticate you over https only. If the
provider offers 2factor authentication mechanism make use of it. Ask
your provider to send you a keyfob. Make sure that the OpenID provider
hosts OpenID only and there are no other associated services with it.
The more infrastructure they have the higher the chances are for
someone to find a vulnerability in there.

I hope that this helps.
