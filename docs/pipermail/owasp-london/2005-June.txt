Morning all,

I gather everyone is enjoying this rare phenomenon known as summer?
I'd love some ideas on:

When you want the next meeting?
Talks (anyone wanting to talk about a topic?)
New location (yes, its time we found something better)

Cheers

Daniel

Summer is here for at least another day or two I guess ;-)

How about a meeting towards the end of July?

cheers
Pete

You're right, there are a lot of conferences on around then. How about
either 18th, 19th or 20th (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) in the third week of
July?
