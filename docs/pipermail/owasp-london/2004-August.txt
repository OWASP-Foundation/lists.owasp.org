hey all,

So honestly, it isnt dead :0)
With the portal now ready and the fact that we only really have 3 weeks
left of summer, how does everyone fancy doing a meeting this month?

I was initially thinking something relaxed, where we can decide on how the
following meetings should flow and be organised?

Comments appreciated

Daniel

Sounds like a great idea. Unfortunately we're booked solid through August 
and I won't have a chance to get to London until Sept ....

I know that the mass migration that happens in August should be over 
now.. so is everyone ready for the first meeting?

Ideally having more than 3 people turn up would be great so ill wait 
whilst everyone gets back to work
