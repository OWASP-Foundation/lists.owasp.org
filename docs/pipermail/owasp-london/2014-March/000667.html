<PRE>OWASP London,

Apologies for hijacking your list but I hope this will be of some relevance to you.

I am in need of a SecOps (Security Operations Engineer) to work for an awesome cloud-software house, with a global product. The position is permanent, with a good package but I'm open to having conversations with contractors also.

The skills I'm after are as follows - would anyone be interested in finding out more be able to recommend a friend/colleague?

  *   Understanding of ModSecurity, Snort or similar security solutions
  *   Knowledge of the OWASP top 10 web vulnerabilities, the nature of the threat vectors, protection mechanisms and mitigations
  *   Thorough understanding of the http protocol
  *   Linux system administration skills
  *   Scripting or programming skills in a language such as Python, Ruby or Perl
  *   Threat analysis and threat profiling
  *   Attack detection and response
  *   Qualifications - probably nice to have - CISSP would be a massive benefit
  *   Knowledge of IIS and understanding of the security aspects of the MS platforms that run on IIS (ASP, ASP.NET web forms, ASP.NET MVC)
  *   Familiarity with PCI DSS compliance
  *   Able to use pentest tools such as Zap, Cenzic, Burp suite
Any help greatly appreciated and apologies again for misuse of the mailing list, I won't make a habit of it.

Many thanks,

Matt

Hi Tobias

Thanks for arranging this, and for everyone else who attended and played OWASP Cornucopia. I've attached a couple of low-res photos. The originals are a bit grainy - I should have taken along a proper camera.

Hi,

just fyi: small reminder and last minute info for the Cornucopia security card game tonight:
We have already gathered a little merry group for our security card game tonight.
But lucky for you, I think we have still a few free seats at the table (or we open up a second table if need be), so even if you have not RSVP'ed yet, please feel free to show up tonight at:

Date &amp; Time: Monday 3rd March at 19:00 hrs
Venue: At The Slaughtered Lamb, 34-35 Great Sutton Street, London EC1V 0DX
<A HREF="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/">http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/</A>
(Nearest underground station: Farringdon)

Please try to be punctual, because soon after getting our drinks ordered, we will start with a little rule introduction and then dive into the game.

Have a great start into the week and see you tonight,

Tobias

Hi all,

ok, we finally made it:

We are on for a game of OWASP Cornucopia in London!
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia</A>

We organised a table to play Cornucopia on March 3rd 19:00 at the The Slaughtered Lamb pub (what a name ;-) ).

Pop Up Cornucopia in Clerkenwell
Date &amp; Time: Monday 3rd March at 19:00 hrs
Venue: At The Slaughtered Lamb, 34-35 Great Sutton Street, London EC1V 0DX
(Nearest underground station: Farringdon)

Just show up at 7pm.
If you can, RSVP via email to me (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">tobias.gondrom at owasp.org</A>&lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">tobias.gondrom at owasp.org</A>&gt;) would be nice, so we have a rough idea how many people are coming. Imagine if the whole OWASP London chapter would descend on a pub unannounced.... - the pub might get &quot;slaughtered&quot;...

Evening is of course free, but you will have to buy your own beer.

And we have as special guest Colin, the designer of this OWASP game joining us. :-)

Timeline:
Start: 19:00
after everyone got their drinks etc. we start with a 10 minute intro into the rules of the game
and then we just have fun with Cornucopia security card game

Winner: the winner gets a free card deck of Cornucopia and an OWASP bag (if we have more than one winner, we let the coin decide)!

And of course everybody gains a lot of fun and security knowledge, enjoying a beer with OWASP folks. ;-)

Looking forward to seeing you next Monday.

  Cheers, Tobias
