<PRE>Hi,

just fyi: small reminder and last minute info for the *Cornucopia
security card game tonight**:*
We have already gathered a little merry group for our security card game
tonight.
But lucky for you, I think we have still a few free seats at the table
(or we open up a second table if need be), so even if you have not
RSVP'ed yet, please feel free to show up *tonight* at:

*Date &amp; Time:**Monday 3rd March at 19:00 hrs**
*Venue: At The Slaughtered Lamb, 34-35 Great Sutton Street, London EC1V 0DX
<A HREF="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/">http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/</A>
(Nearest underground station: Farringdon)

Please try to be punctual, because soon after getting our drinks
ordered, we will start with a little rule introduction and then dive
into the game.

Have a great start into the week and see you tonight,

Tobias

    Hi all,

    ok, we finally made it:

    *We are on for a game of OWASP Cornucopia in London!**
    <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia</A>
    *
    We organised a table to play Cornucopia on March 3rd 19:00 at the
    The Slaughtered Lamb pub (what a name ;-) ). 

    Pop Up Cornucopia in Clerkenwell
    *Date &amp; Time:**Monday 3rd March at 19:00 hrs**
    *Venue: At The Slaughtered Lamb, 34-35 Great Sutton Street, London
    EC1V 0DX
    (Nearest underground station: Farringdon)

    Just show up at 7pm.
    If you can, RSVP via email to me (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">tobias.gondrom at owasp.org</A>
    &lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">tobias.gondrom at owasp.org</A>&gt;) would be nice, so we have a rough
    idea how many people are coming. Imagine if the whole OWASP London
    chapter would descend on a pub unannounced.... - the pub might get
    &quot;slaughtered&quot;...

    Evening is of course free, but you will have to buy your own beer.

    And we have as special guest Colin, the designer of this OWASP game
    joining us. :-)

    Timeline:
    *Start: 19:00*
    after everyone got their drinks etc. we start with a 10 minute intro
    into the rules of the game
    and then we just have fun with Cornucopia security card game

    *Winner: *the winner gets a free card deck of Cornucopia and an
    OWASP bag (if we have more than one winner, we let the coin decide)!

    And of course everybody gains *a lot of fun and security knowledge,
    enjoying a beer with OWASP folks. ;-) *

    Looking forward to seeing you next Monday.

    Cheers, Tobias

    &gt; Hi all, hi Colin,
    &gt;
    &gt; sorry, I couldn't make it to the meetup on Feb-5.
    &gt;
    &gt; But since Colin's first presentation of Cornucopia, I was wondering
    &gt; whether maybe a few of you would like to just try it out, playing
    it on
    &gt; an evening based on any sample application (either from one of the
    &gt; group, or something general like internet banking, ebay, paypal,
    &gt; facebook). Could be fun and very interesting.
    &gt;
    &gt; For example would some people like to play it on Feb-25 in the evening
    &gt; (like from 18:30-21:30)?
    &gt; Either reply here or via email to me directly.
    &gt; If we get enough interest, we can organise a normal meeting room
    and get
    &gt; some pizza and get the game going. ;-)
    &gt;
    &gt; Would love to try it out and play it.
    &gt;
