Subject: [Owasp-london] Call for venues
Message-ID: <C0F948B0-3971-4AE3-8CB5-26B4A556E1D0@owasp.org>

All,

As you've probably noticed, we haven't had any meetings since June. What you're probably not aware of is that this is largely because of the trouble we've had securing meeting spaces, and we've unfortunately not been able to secure space for a couple of planned meetings (most recent being a planned October one).

As such - I thought I'd put out a call for venues. We're looking for meeting space which fits the following criteria:

1) fairly central - i.e. easy for folks to get to. We've met a lot in Central London / Canary Wharf in the past
2) fairly cheap / free - we've usually used corporate facilities in the past as they can usually be provided for free to OWASP
3) can be used 6:30pm - 9:30pm

I'm happy to look at alternative venues as well - any venues that are good ones used for any other meet ups may be of interest. Ideally I'd like to get a full 2014 year of meetings booked in at this point so we can avoid the problems we've had this time around.

Looking forward to some good suggestions!

Best regards

Justin
