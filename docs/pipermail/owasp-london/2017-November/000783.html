<PRE>All,

November is going to be a busy month for us: OWASP Board Elections (have 
you voted yet?), a CTF and... there will be not one, but *two* OWASP 
London Chapter Meetings in November!

We are pleased to announce that Jeff Williams - the co-founder of the 
OWASP Foundation, creator of OWASP Top 10 project, WebGoat and a 
co-author and contributor to many other OWASP projects has kindly agreed 
to present a talk during his visit to London - hence the additional meetup.

These are the dates of the upcoming meet-ups:

23rd November 2017 (6:30pm) - OWASP London Chapter Meeting kindly hosted 
and sponsored by The Telegraph Media Group:

Talks:

  * &quot;How To Hack the UK Online Tax System, I Guess&quot; - Thomas Shadwell
    (@zemnmez)
  * &quot;SHA-3 vs the World&quot; - David Wong (@lyon01_david)

30th November 2017 (6:30pm) - OWASP London Chapter Meeting kindly hosted 
and sponsored by Just Eat:

Talks:

  * &quot;Can DevSecOps Prevent the Impending Software Apocalypse?&quot; - Jeff
    Williams (@planetlevel)

Talk details and speaker bios for both events are available on our webpage:

Please note that space at each event is limited to 100 attendees and we 
expect both events to 'sell-out' very quickly, so please only book 
tickets if you are definitely able to attend.

We will live-stream and video-record both events. Additionally the event 
on the 30th November 2017 featuring Jeff Williams will be live-streamed 
on the video-wall of Just Eat offices in Bristol in collaboration with 
our colleagues from the OWASP Bristol Chapter


Looking forward to seeing you.

Regards,

Sam Stepanyan and Sherif Mansour
OWASP London Chapter Leaders
