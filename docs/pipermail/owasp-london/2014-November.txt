All,

Our next meeting in December (last for 2014!) is at our venue sponsor for the year, Skype, at their offices at 2 Waterhouse Square, 140 Holborn, London, EC1N 2ST.  

I?m confirming talk details with speakers now, so I?ll update when we have the details, however best I announce this now so you can all get this on your calendars.

In the meantime, I've setup the Eventbrite page to RSVP here - http://owasp-london.eventbrite.co.uk/ <http://owasp-london.eventbrite.co.uk/>  Please note that RSVPs close the evening before the event so we get names on the door!

See you all there :)

Justin
