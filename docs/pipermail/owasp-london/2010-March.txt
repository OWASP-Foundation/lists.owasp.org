Subject: [Owasp-london] Final Reminder - Next London OWASP meeting Thursday
	the 4th of March,
	at Nomura in the City - RSVPs close Wednesday 5pm!!!
Message-ID: <5F2E6C87-1012-4820-81B4-50ED7425C988@owasp.org>

This is the final reminder for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to be held on Thursday March 4th, at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between 6pm-6:30pm).

We're at a the same location as the last meeting, at Nomura who have kindly agreed to let us use their facilities:

- Nomura, Nomura House, 1 St Martins-le-Grand, London EC1A 4NP

Should be easy to find - this is near to St Pauls in the City, and Google Maps etc should be more accurate for showing you where it is.

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com. Note, please enter your real name, as this will be given to Nomura building security. If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close 5pm the day before the event so we can get names on the door, so make sure you RSVP in advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at justin.clarke at owasp.org so your space can be released for someone else.

* OWASP Top Ten 2010 - Fabio Cerrulo

The primary aim of the OWASP Top 10 is to educate developers, designers, architects and organisations about the consequences of the most important web application security weaknesses. The Top 10 provides basic methods to protect against these high risk problem areas and provides guidance on where to go from there. The Top 10 project is referenced by many standards, books, tools, and organisations, including MITRE, PCI DSS, DISA, FTC, and many more. The OWASP Top 10 was initially released in 2003 and minor updates were made in 2004, 2007, and this 2010 release. We encourage you to use the Top 10 to get your organisation started with application security so developers can learn from the mistakes of other organisations. Executives can start thinking about how to manage the risk that software applications create in their enterprise.

This significant update presents a more concise, risk focused list of the Top 10 Most Critical Web Application Security Risks. The OWASP Top 10 has always been about risk, but this update makes this much more clear than previous editions, and provides additional information on how to assess these risks for your applications. For each Top 10 item, this release discusses the general likelihood and consequence factors that are used to categorise the typical severity of the risk, and then presents guidance on how to verify whether you have problems in this area, how to avoid them, some example flaws in that area, and pointers to links with more information.

We will also be having a discussion forum to wrap up the evening on how can we roll this out to the wider community.

==Speakers==

Hi Dinis,

Wouldn't it be a good idea to include OWASP ASVS in the list and show how
this can be corelated with OWASP development and testing guides.

As the mapping between the ASVS and other guides is taking place at the
moment and a new version of OWASP Guide has just started it would be good to
show everyone how all these can be mapped together and how the new numbering
scheme is going to work. I am sure this will help the developers and the
users of these guides tremendously.

Just my 2 cents...

Regards
Vishal

I recommend Eventbrite for free events.  Do you have an account?  If not, I
can help you get set up.

Message-ID: <E857D87B-4675-4B2B-ABBF-759BF9E52DE2@owasp.org>

Hi all,

As you may know, we are looking to put together a couple of local OWASP days in the next couple of months (see http://www.owasp.org/index.php/London/Training/OWASP_projects_and_resources_you_can_use_TODAY for details).

What we need is venues for the training, so if any of you (or your companies/universities etc) can provide space for this for the day, please get in touch with me ASAP. The proposed dates are:
- April 9 (Friday)
- May 28 (Friday)

Cheers

Justin

Subject: [Owasp-london] OWASP London - Announcement - Training/OWASP
	Projects and resources you can use TODAY
Message-ID: <28C08689-7029-46E4-99B9-569FD2CBEA3D@owasp.org>

This is the announcement for the forthcoming full-day OWASP training on OWASP projects and resources. We have two confirmed dates for these courses - on April 16, 2010 and May 28, 2010.  Signup is open for the April session (see links at the bottom of the email). Spaces are limited (only 20 spaces on the April delivery), so first come first served.

Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most OWASP Projects are not widely used and understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of quality and usefulness of those Document & Tool projects, but due to a lack of understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem or in the Web Application Development Life-cycle.
This course aims to change that by providing a selection of mature and enterprise ready projects together with practical examples of how to use them.
The course will be very practical where demonstration and hands-on exercises will be provided for the tools covered.
If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of the course, please bring a laptop.

Please note that this training is free, but is currently open to only OWASP Members. However, if you've been looking for a good reason to join as an OWASP Member its only USD$50 to join for a year (approximately ?33 at current exchange rates). 

To sign up for the courses, follow the registration links from here - http://www.owasp.org/index.php/London/Training/OWASP_projects_and_resources_you_can_use_TODAY

To join OWASP now, follow this link - https://guest.cvent.com/EVENTS/Register/IdentityConfirmation.aspx?e=c6554982-632d-4218-8c77-636ee772baff

Best regards
