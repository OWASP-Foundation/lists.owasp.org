Please forward to all the developers and development teams you know!!


OWASP Foundation would love to get your feedback and to start 
immediately raising awareness about what?s changed in this update to the 
OWASP Top 10.


The primary change is the addition of two new categories:


*2017-A7: Insufficient Attack Protection*

*2017-A10: Underprotected APIs*


OWASP plans to release the final version of the OWASP Top 10 - 2017 in 
July or August 2017 after a public comment period ending June 30, 2017.

Constructive comments on this OWASP Top 10 - 2017 Release 
Candidate should be forwarded via email to OWASP-TopTen at lists.owasp.org 
<mailto:OWASP-TopTen at lists.owasp.org>.


Private comments may be sent to dave.wichers at owasp.org 
<mailto:dave.wichers at owasp.org> . Anonymous comments are welcome.  All  
non-private comments will be catalogued and published at the same time 
as the final public release.  Comments recommending changes to the items 
listed in the Top 10 should include a complete suggested list of 
changes, along with a rationale for any changes.


All comments should indicate the specific relevant page and section.


Please do not reply/send any comments to OWASP-London mailing list. Send 
your feedback/comments to: OWASP-TopTen at lists.owasp.org 
<mailto:OWASP-TopTen at lists.owasp.org>

We recognise that there is a lot of controversy regarding the newly 
proposed 2017-A7 'Insufficient Attack Protection'. Please read this 
article in CSO Online before you start start criticising the new A7:

Your feedback is critical to the continued success of the

world?s software for everyone.
