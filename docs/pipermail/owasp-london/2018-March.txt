Hi, if you are around this evening please join us for the 4th GDPR Working

specific threat modeling scenarios. This continues to work we started at
the last GDPR Working Session.

the building, and the remote participation Google Hangouts link)

We have started to add all the materials to this GitHub repo

methods, processes, standards, SDLC, code review

Recommended talk duration is 45 minutes with additional 10-15 minutes 
for any live demos and Q&A.

We also encourage short ?lightning? talks: 5-10 minutes in duration.

If you would like to present a talk at future OWASP London Chapter 
meetings please review and agree with the OWASP Speaker Agreement here:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement

and contact the OWASP London Chapter Leaders via e-mail: 
owasplondon at owasp.org with the following details:

1. The title of your proposed talk (up to 12 words)
2. The abstract summarising your proposed talk (70-150 words)
3. The speaker bio (70-150 words)

Please note that you can also pair up with a colleague and present a 
joint talk.

Please ensure that your talk is objective, stresses open source 
approaches, and avoids references to any commercial offerings of your 
company.

We are looking forward to your submissions.
