Re: OWASP Ireland September 17th 2010

Hello,

The agenda has been finalised for the OWASP Ireland event. We have the pleasure to announce a number of key figures from industry which should provide some unique insight into the latest trends, threats and methodologies in the world of application security.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_IRELAND_2010
Keynotes:

John Viega: ?Application Security in the Real World? - Considerations for AppSec in non-security companies.

John is Executive Vice President of Products and Engineering at Perimeter E-Security. John has authored numerous books on security, including the recent ?Myths of Security?, and the seminal ?Building Secure Software?, which was the first book on application security.

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/John_Viega

Professor Fred Piper "The changing face of cryptography"

Fred Piper was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of London in 1975 and has worked in information security since 1979. In 1985, he formed a company, Codes & Ciphers Ltd, which offers consultancy advice in all aspects of information security. He has acted as a consultant to over 80 companies including a number of financial institutions and major industrial companies in the UK, Europe, Asia, Australia, South Africa and the USA. The consultancy work has been varied and has included algorithm design and analysis, work on EFTPOS and ATM networks, data systems, security audits, risk analysis and the formulation of security policies. He has lectured worldwide on information security, both academically and commercially, has published more than 100 papers and is joint author of Cipher Systems (1982), one of the first books to be published on the subject of protection of communications, Secure Speech Communications (1985), Digital Signatures - Security & Controls (1999) and Cryptography: A Very Short Introduction (2002).

Hi, 

Iam looking for all your valuable suggestions for avoiding a vunerbility through form data in a web application. Which characters needs to be encoded to avoid such injection attacks as part of html entity encoding?.Injection of which chars into our form data will prone to HTML Injections?
As of now we are vaidating \",/,\,:,*,?,<,>,|,;,%,#,~ characters from user input into the form input fields of our web application.Also we have implemented encoding methodology to encode {"<",">","\'","&"} to {"<",""",">","&"} where ever we allowed these characters from user input into our application form fields.Does it requires to enhance out encoding methodology to any other chars to get rid of any vulnerbility situation?

 

Please update me with your valuable suggestions ASAP. 

 

Thanks & regards, Sureshbabu

Hi,
What web technology is being used? PHP, ASP, ASPX, JSP, etc?

Depending on the technology used, there are built in functions to do
the encoding for you. Much safer than using a custom blacklist.

Hi Sureshbabu,

Are there any particular threats you're looking to address (i.e. are you fixing a known issue?), or are you looking to secure this in general?

The problem of handling user input will generally involve some combination of input validation and output encoding to get where you probably want to be.  As an example, you're outlining a black-list input validation approach (defining "known bad" characters) which may be susceptible to bypass in certain circumstances if an alternative encoding can be used.  Additionally, the HTML encoding noted may also be susceptible to the same problem.

In both these cases, you would need to take a more thorough approach to be more secure - for example only accepting known good characters (white-list validation) and encoding all characters except for those that are known to be safe (OWASP Encoding and Microsoft Anti-XSS take this approach). Of course, doing this may not be justified for all situations.

My 2c

Justin

Subject: [Owasp-london] UK Info Commissioner Enforcements and Website Hacks
Message-ID: <4C7CA668.1050208@iol.ie>


Hello list,

Over the weekend, I did a brief analysis of the enforcement notices that 
have been handed out by the UK Information Commissioner (ICO) to 
organisations found to be in breach of the Data Protection Act.

The idea was to see how many incidents were a result of a website hack 
(SQL Injection, XSS etc.)  About 100 enforcements are listed on the  ICO 
website covering the period from January 2008 to August 2010.

I found that none of the breaches were the result of a website hack. No 
SQL injection, XSS, CSRF attacks etc. The vast majority were related to 
unencrypted USB sticks, CDs, laptops etc. which have been lost or 
stolen. The next most popular cause was loss or theft of paper records.

Should Daniel, Dinis, Ivan, Justin pat themselves on the back - a job 
well done?

regards

Alexis

Unfortunately I find it extremely hard to believe that no UK based organisation (or their outsourced providers) didn't suffer a relevant data breach in the last two and half years.  Probably the most relevant from an ICO point of view would be data theft via SQL Injection, and I know of at least one non-UK organisation that would have been in breach of this with a SQL Injection attack on UK sourced personal data.

Perhaps this shows a gap in what ICO is looking for? There are a lot of difficulties with web attacks in quantifying what was exposed (you usually have to assume it all was) so perhaps this is just something that fits into the "too hard" bucket? Or are organisations not even reporting these to the ICO? I'd think its probably the latter, as many of the SME organisations I'm aware of wouldn't have a clue as to their responsibilities, and some bigger organisations aren't much better...

I was surprised by the results myself. I agree with you that many 
(most?) breaches are probably not reported to the ICO. 
The Irish Data Protection Commissioner has proposed new rules for 
obligatory data breach notification in Ireland.
    http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/10/ireland_data_rules/
It will be interesting to see what impact they have - if they come into 
force.

I reread my email again and it does come across a bit dejected ;-)

I wonder if there is any scope to help the ICO in knowing what they're looking for? After all, they clearly state "website" in much of the guidance as something that is within what they're looking for, but clearly they're not handing out enforcement notices either?  As opposed to physical data breach, its all too likely that UK personal data ends up overseas and/or with criminal gangs rather than with lost or stolen USB sticks and laptops (which may have just been wiped and onsold).

regards

Justin

The current relevant guidance documents are:

Guidance on data security breach management, 27 March 2008
http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/guidance_on_data_security_breach_management.pdf

Notification of Data Security Breaches to the Information
Commissioner?s Office, v4, 8 July 2010
http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/breach_reporting.pdf

It seems to be being updated, so they may be open to a pro-active
approach with suggestions.

Hi,
My take on this is that where a physical asset such as a laptop or
storage media is lost then the organisation is sure that they have
lost or compromised data. These incidents are therefore reported
because the data loss is unambiguous.

Where a breach occurs through a web application and there are
insufficient controls in place to identify the scope of the breach the
organisation may no know if data has been exfiltrated or how much may
have been compromised. Ignorance is bliss and in the absence of
evidence a report is not made. Could this safety blanket potentially
be a barrier to the adoption data loss monitoring and countermeasure?

You could read this as a success for the security of web applications
or a failure in the detection of data breaches. I sincerely hope that
common sense leads the reader to the latter scenario as being most
likely.

Regards,
Jim

In my experience I would put this down as a failure in reporting
rather than a successes in web application security.

Does the ICO have a contact where you can query this data?

I'd be willing to bet that many successful SQL injection attacks on  
production apps are leaving no error logs, or nobody is analysing the  
logs; and they are likely go undiscovered, let alone unreported :-)

Sadly, I think you're probably right.  I also agree with Jim that this is likely largely an information problem. Firstly, and organisation may not even be aware that they have had a breach from a web application attack. Also, in the case that they are aware of a breach they may not be able to quantify the problem through lack of logged information.  I've only come across one instance where an organisation we've worked with had a good record of exactly what data was exposed, and even in that case it was largely blind luck that they had been logging that information...

In the case that an organisation with my data is aware they've had a breach that they can't quantify I'd like to see them assume that the information has been exposed and act accordingly, but do they see it that way?

regards

Justin

Hi Group

I can 100% say that those stats are not correct. (by this I mean data is
lost via SQL + XSS/CSRF)
I know this as I routinely have reported to companies and websites of data
breeches which involve SQLInjection.

where I have not received a response and the hole remains open I have
contacted UK Info Commissioner at casework at ico.gsi.gov.uk

I have even received responses from them.

" If you believe that any organisation?s website does present a major
security risk as far as personal data are concerned, you can report it to
this office by email and we will assess whether we need to pursue the matter
with the data controller.

 "

So are breeches happening because of WebSecurity holes  = yep.

Are they being reported = yep to Uk Information comissioner and other Govt
Agencies depending on the site.
 (however you'll find that if a company finds or gets notified about an SQL
hole they will generally plug it and *not *notify anybody, they will just
hope that no data got stolen and no one of authority noticed)

There are many people out there who are using custom tools and their learned
skillset to try and warn businesses before the bad guys get in.
We do this for free and in an attempt to try and secure our web integrity.

I'm not 100% sure but I think most countires have seperate groups some govt
funded however most are vonenteer based.

I'd just say that those stats only prove that virtually all organisations
hide the fact that they got owned,
(It hurts the share price to state "we lost 10 milion customer records)

Subject: [Owasp-london] Announcement - Next London OWASP meeting Thursday
	the 9th of September, at Deloitte in the City
Message-ID: <9EB8DDF1-8B1A-472F-AD96-F952556C99B2@owasp.org>

This is the announcement for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to be held on Thursday September 9th, at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between 6:00pm-6:30pm).

We're at a new location this time, at Deloitte who have kindly agreed to let us use their facilities:

- Deloitte, 2 New Street Square, London, EC4A 3BZ

Note that we're back to our normal time!

As always, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com. Note, please enter your real name, as this will be given to Deloitte building security. If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close the afternoon of the day before the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at justin.clarke at owasp.org so your space can be released for someone else.

==Talks==

CAT - Michael Jordon
Context Application Tool (CAT) is a tool for performing manual web application penetration testing. The presentation will show the main features of CAT with demonstrations of where CAT can perform tests that other tools currently available cannot and how CAT empowers the user to create more complex test cases to further explore the boundaries of the application. The focus of CAT is on manual penetration testing and not on automated web VA scanning. Also a sneak preview of the current features that are currently in development an due to be release late this year.
Security in the SDLC: IT Doesn't Have To Be Painful! - Matt Bartoldus
Why do organizations fail so miserably at Application Security? Even after investing millions into Information Security programs? Organizations are addressing application security through initiatives from hiring their first 'Security Person' to investing in large time and resource intensive projects. Great! So how come security breaches through applications are still on the rise and showing no signs of abatement? Is the security industry failing? This talk will focus on what the speaker has experienced over the past few years while working with his clients to integrate information security practices into IT processes. This includes large Global Top 100 to medium domestic UK companies. The focus will be around some of the different approaches that were taken and the things that worked and the things that failed miserably. In the end, the audience will be able to take away real world experiences for consideration. The talk will start by discussing some of the more interesting angles the speaker has seen when presenting the business case for a security integration project investment. This includes stepping outside of the traditional security professional arguments and adopting the viewpoint from other parts of an organization. The speaker will then discuss the age old IT consultant's mantra of People, Process and Technology and where security practices fits in. The focus will be on process and people rather than technology. Building upon a business case and the theories around people and processes, we will discuss how to move forward with integrating information security practices into the SDLC. Lastly, we'll talk about the 'gotchas', the pitfalls, traps, and other 'bad things' from perceptions to internal politics. These are discussed in a light-hearted manner through example experiences and 'war stories.' The speaker hopes they will be considered at the beginning of a security initiative or project part of project risk and critical success Factors!
