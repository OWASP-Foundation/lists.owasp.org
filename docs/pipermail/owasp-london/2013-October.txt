All,

Thanks for all the responses on venues, and we're in the process of confirming a full calendar of meetings, both for the remainder of 2013, and also for 2014 as well (thanks to all who responded!).  Our next meeting will be this Thursday at Expedia Inc (near Angel), who have generously provided us space.  Incidentally, if you're in the job market Expedia/hotels.com are currently recruiting Java Devs, QA?s, ScrumMasters and BigData folk with hadoop experience.

Details are:

Date: Thursday, 24th of October 2013. 6:30pm - 8:30pm
Venue:  Expedia Inc, Angel Building, 407 St John Street, London, EC1V 4EX
Cost: FREE, and open to all

Talks:

Dinis and I are going to reprise two of the talks we both presented at the recent EUTour events:

? Using the O2 Platform, Zap and AppSensor to protect and test applications - Dinis Cruz

This presentation will show how these 3 OWASP tools can be used to find and mitigate security vulnerabilities in applications. The O2 Platform will be used to analyse the target application source code, and automate the use of both Zap and AppSensor's capabilities.

? OWASP Mobile Top 10 - Justin Clarke

The OWASP Mobile Security Project is a centralised resource intended to give developers and security teams the resources they need to build and maintain secure mobile applications. Through the project, our goal is to classify mobile security risks and provide developmental controls to reduce their impact or likelihood of exploitation. Justin will be going through the current version of the Mobile Top 10, as well as discussing what is currently happening with the project.

I've setup the Eventbrite page to RSVP here - http://owasp-london.eventbrite.co.uk/. RSVP will close on Wednesday afternoon in order to get the list of names to Expedia security to let you into the building on the day, so if you're going to forward this email to friends and colleagues, please do it now :)

See you all there!

Justin

Hi guys,

nice to meet many of you tonight at our London chapter meeting.
Just in case you haven't voted yet. The voting period for our global
OWASP elections ends today, on Friday at 23:59 CST. So this is your last
chance to voice your opinion on the candidates for the board, for the
WASPY Awards and also on how we want to handle project sponsoring in the
future.
Every voting member should have received personal invitation and
reminder emails over the last couple of days, so follow the link there
and cast your vote and voice your opinion.

Cheers and see you soon at our next chapter meeting coming very soon.

Tobias
