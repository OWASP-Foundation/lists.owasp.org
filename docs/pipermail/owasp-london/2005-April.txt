Funnily enough i agree!

the CMA was designed to be so wide open, that when they did catch 
someone who broke into a system, the law was able to come down on them 
like a ton of bricks.
The problem at the moment is that lawyers, and the courts, have no 
understanding of computer security law and thus treat it like normal 
unauthorized entry.

The worst part about this whole saga is that the CCU have destroyed my 
earning capabilities and hence whilst i wait for this to finish, i sit 
at home making music and twiddling my thumbs (so much for this innocent 
until proven guilty lark)

The hearing is next week thursday and yes we do have a brilliant legal 
team and case prepared and i expect some red faces to be shown when we 
do go to court.

Thanks for the support all

I wish Daniel all the best and I am sure there was no malicious
intention. 

I don't know what their "evidence" is against him but it got me thinking
what is the minimum amount of evidence the police services would need
against someone to take them to court. 

E.g. if I go to a website and enter a single quotation mark in a form
text field am I attempting a SQL injection hack? 
Or if I then append a sql statement to this quotation mark that prints
out the version number of the database server am I attempting to hack
the site?

I think the computer misuse act said something about unauthorized access
so appending the sql statement would probably potentially get you
arrested, even through obtaining the version number on its own wouldn't
allow you to do much.

Just for the record:

*         I believe 100% in is innocence,

*         I think that what is happening with Daniel is one of the biggest
injustices that I have seem in a long time


What is very serious about this case is how the UK's CCU (Computer Crime
Unit) and the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service)  are able to prosecute
somebody in such manner (being arrested on the workplace) and under such
accusations.

Since this could happen to any of us, we should all take this case very
seriously and be involved as much as we can.

This case just shows how the current version of the UK's CMA (Computer
Misuse Act) is completed out of sync with the real-world and is an 'almost'
useless piece of legislation which is very inefficient in catching the bad
guys, but is very effectively used against the good guys (for example if you
tell anybody that they have a vulnerability in their website, server or
application you can be reported to the CCU under the CMA). 

In fact we should start a lobby group to put pressure to change this law so
that:
 
    a) the 'intent' of the 'accuser' is taken into account (the current
version of the CAM is used by companies to 'shut-up' anybody that is
'telling them' that about vulnerabilities in their products)

    b) the definition of 'authorized access' is very clear (If you look
careful to the current version of the CMA, almost all of us are potential
criminals, since It could be argued that we don't have explicit
authorization to access most systems we (legitimaly) access during our
normal work (note that this could include most software (except probably the
Operating System) that we install in our computers

I believe (although I am no lawyer) the important point revolves around
"intent". I do not know Daniel, so I can't comment for him, but the
prosecution would need to prove (beyond reasonable doubt?) that the
intention was to misuse the system. All of which depends on their
evidence.

Can we start a petition? If we can provide a document with support from numerous security experts we can point out where the law is failing in this case.

Maybe worth an article on theregister / securityfocus / slashdot? Media attention can really help in these cases.

Half the problem with computer crime units is that they need high profile
/ any cases to prosecute, otherwise they don't get funding, and their
little empires will disappear. Many cases are chosen simply to be warnings
to others.

Conflated with the usual problems of the police forces around the world
(essentially, they cannot afford to pay market rates and the lack of
career paths within them for specialists), it makes it very difficult for
them to retain quality staff.

I feel for Daniel. I hope he gets a judge who is willing to listen to
evidence presented, and will consider Daniel's intent, not actions alleged
by the prosecution.

Is there a possibility of calling expert witnesses? If he can, get a good
lawyer - if he's going to plead anything but guilty, a good lawyer worth
their weight in gold (which is why they charge similar figures of dosh).

Good luck,
Andrew

I haven't ever met Daniel but find it hard to believe that someone who
has contributed a lot to OWASP would hack a charity's website.

I think people would need to know what the evidence was before signing a
petition etc but appreciate this may not be possible before the trial.

Message-ID: <41649.212.32.48.101.1113897484.squirrel@webmail.owasp.org>

Morning all,

At the previous OWASP London meeting (and AppSec con held the other
weekend), there was talk of having some form of mechanism in which people
could submit documents/code/tools/advice etc to OWASP but not be in breach
of their NDA/Contract/Current terms of employment.

Whilst we work on a more suitable solution, I've setup a gmail account
called owaspsubmissions at gmail.com

All the relevant people will have access to this mail account and we will
take the information sent from you all and sanitize it so that no personal
details are left that could identify you.

Hope this helps?


Daniel

I think the major problem with this that the people who wish to contribute
anonymously need to seriously think about getting their contracts modified.

In Australia, it's a breach of the Trade Practices Act to restrict people
working outside hours on ANYTHING - even industries closely allied with your
day job. 

I am not suggesting that people should violate their NDAs or IP with their
employer - if you know something about a particular product, it's probably
not useful to us anyway, and if you developed a new attack method on your
employer's time and used their resources, well they paid for it, and they
own it. Again, not something we can easily use.

However, the rest of your time is your own, despite employer claims to the
contrary. Particularly when you do not use any employer time or resources to
do activity X. Employers have often shoved "everything you know and
everything you will do whilst employed by us is ours". I refer them to the
TPA. You cannot contract an illegal act, and you cannot contract to reduce
rights given to you by law. Generally, I am contracted to do 40 hours of
work a week, plus whatever I am willing to give away if I've made an
estimation error in my timings. If they really want to own all of my stuff,
they can pay me for 168 hours a week, and give me a laptop computer and
outfit my home office, pay for the space on a commercial basis, and pay my
mobile and comms bills. They don't do these things, so they don't get
anything after 5.30 pm.

A few years ago, my friend Luke and I came up with the idea that it is a
good idea to get the IP thing out of the road early on. As I was the
President of SAGE-AU at the time, we had a lawyer draft it, and it's legal
for Australia. If you share our common law, it's likely that it'll work in
the UK and possibly even the US.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/osda/

The OSDA explicitly sets out what you can do out of hours if you're in any
doubt. I use it from time to time when I don't get through to a particular
employer's thick skull that they actually don't own my time.

Subject: [Owasp-london] New Whitepaper - Stopping Automated Attack Tools
Message-ID: <E1DQUOH-0003m3-VO@sc8-sf-mx1.sourceforge.net>

Hi List,

There were a number of queries about my previous paper "Anti Brute Force
Reource Metering".  It appears that way too many people havn't yet gotten to
grips with some of the more standard/basic methods of preventing automated
tools from attacking a web-based application.

So, to help the community along, I've pulled together a new whitepaper
entitled "Stopping Automated Attack Tools" which covers the most
popular/efficient methods of ...wait for it... stopping automated attack
tools!

The paper covers the 10 most common/successful methods of actively
preventing/breaking/stopping attack tools when targeted at a web-based
application.  In addition, I've added three new groupings explaining how the
use of client-side code can strengthen these applications and work to defend
against current and future attack tools.  An analysis and comparison of the
different techniques is also made.

Paper Location:
http://www.ngssoftware.com/papers/StoppingAutomatedAttackTools.pdf


Paper Abstract:

An almost infinite array of automated tools exist to spider and mirror
application content, extract confidential material, brute force guess
authentication credentials, discover code-injection flaws, fuzz application
variables for exploitable overflows, scan for common files or vulnerable
CGI's, and generally attack or exploit web-based application flaws.  While
of great value to security professionals, the use of these tools by
attackers represents a clear and present danger to all organisations.
These automated tools have become increasingly popular for attackers seeking
to compromise the integrity of online applications, and are used during most
phases of an attack.  Whilst there are a number of defence techniques which,
when incorporated into a web-based application, are capable of stopping even
the latest generation of tools, unfortunately most organisations have failed
to adopt them.
This whitepaper examines techniques which are capable of defending an
application against these tools; providing advice on their particular
strengths and weaknesses and proposing solutions capable of stopping the
next generation of automated attack tools.



Anyhow, I imagine that the paper will be of use to most of you out
there...pass it to your organisations web-app developers and get them to
read it and implement some of the security techniques.  I know my clients
will be making good use of the information ;-)


Cheers,

Gunter Ollmann
