<PRE>All,

We are excited to announce the OWASP London Hackathon and CTF event 
which will be taking place on the evenings on 28th and 29th of November 
2016 in Central London.

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a type of computer security competition. 
Contestants are presented with a set of challenges and puzzles which 
test their creativity, technical (and googling) skills, and 
problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories 
and when solved, each yields a &#8220;flag&#8221; which is submitted to a real-time 
scoring service. The difficulty levels are from beginner to advanced.

CTF tournaments are a great and fun way for software developers to learn 
a wide array of applications security skills in a safe and legal 
environment.

This event is kindly hosted and sponsored by: ThoughtWorks London

Location: ThoughtWorks, 76 Wardour Street, London, W1F 0UR

Nearest Tubes: Piccadilly Circus (6 minute walk), Leicester Square (6 
minute walk), Tottenham Court Road (9 minute walk), Oxford Circus (9
