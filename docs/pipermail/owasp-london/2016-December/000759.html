<PRE>All,

With 2016 coming to an end we hope you enjoyed being a part of OWASP 
London Chapter events this year. We had 7 events in 2016: 5 Chapter 
meetings and 2 Hackathon/CTF events.

OWASP London Chapter is now looking forward to an interesting and 
eventful year 2017. We plan to run a minimum of 5 Chapter meetings in 
2017. Our events are free and open to anyone interested in Information 
and Application Security and are usually attended by 70-100 attendees.

We encourage security professionals, researchers and developers to 
present talks at our upcoming Chapter events.

OWASP mainly focuses on these 3 tracks:

  - Builders
  - Breakers
  - Defenders


As a guideline we invite talks on the following topics (not exhaustive 
list):

   * Novel web/mobile vulnerabilities and countermeasures (note: no 
zero-days, any vulnerabilities must be responsibly disclosed prior to 
presenting at OWASP events)
   * New technologies, paradigms, frameworks, tools
   * OWASP tools or projects - new and existing, best practices and 
experience of implementing them in your company
   * Agile Security and Continuous Integration
   * Secure development: frameworks, best practices, secure coding, 
methods, processes, standards, SDLC, code review
   * AppSec Pipeline - Automation and Orchestration
   * Threat modelling
   * AI and Machine Learning in Application Security
   * Browser security
   * IoT security and AppSec
   * JavaScript/Node.JS security
   * Mobile security and security for the mobile web
   * Threat Intelligence &amp; AppSec
   * Cloud security, Container security
   * REST/SOAP and API security
   * Security of frameworks
   * Payment Security, PCI impact on AppSec, tools, frameworks, best 
practices
   * Blockchain &amp; AppSecurity
   * Cryptography and its use (and abuse) in Mobile and Web Apps
   * Data Privacy, Governance
   * Management topics: Managing Secure Software Development 
LifeCycle(SDLC), Managing Application Security initiatives, Developer 
Training

Recommended talk duration is 45 minutes with additional 15 minutes for 
any live demos and Q&amp;A.

We also encourage short &#8220;lightning&#8221; talks: 5-10 minutes in duration.

If you would like to present a talk at future OWASP London Chapter 
meetings please review and agree with the OWASP Speaker Agreement here:
