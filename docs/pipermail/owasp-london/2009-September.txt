Hi, I'm sure in this list is people who can help (or can make this happen)

The OWASP Global Education Committee is doing a great job (see links below)
and now (following their success in the US) they are trying to get more UK
Universities involved.

Note that is no charge for Universities (see
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership#Categories_of_Membership_.26_Supporters)
all we need is their support and involvement.

Here are some links to the great work these guys are doing at the Global
Education Committee (and Fabio, feel free to provide more info)

   - http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Education_Committee
   - http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Education_Project

The problem is that I don't have that many contacts with UK Universities, so
please put us in touch with the interested parties

hi Jason et al,

I've prepared a short presentation which details the benefits and
requirements of becoming an OWASP Educational Supporter.

I am using this document when approaching Universities and Educational
Centers asking them to become OWASP members.

Please feel free to use it and obviously comments/feedback are always
welcome.

Thank you,

(Forwarded to the London list for any of our more Northern brethren who are
on this list)

List
 
Full schedule for the first OWASP Leeds chapter meeting is now up on the
OWASP Leeds web page. Presentation details and speaker bio?s have also been
posted (copy of posting below). Also I have utilised ?eventbrite? to
organise this event. If you are coming please go to the eventbrite link and
register. This will give the Chapter an indication of numbers, remember we
have space for 40!
 
Regards
 
Jason Alexander
OWASP Leeds Chapter Leader
 
Please visit http://www.eventbrite.com/event/445437315 to RSVP a place !!!

Date: 14th October 6:00pm start

Location: Leeds Novotel, 4 Whitehall, Whitehall Quay, Leeds, LSI 4HR.

Schedule: 

6:00pm - 6:15pm Registration & refreshments

6:15pm - 6:30pm OWASP Leeds Chapter Presentation - Jason Alexander

Introduction to OWASP and its charter. Leeds Chapter details.

6:30pm - 7:30pm "The right way to secure Oracle" - Pete Finnigan

The talk covers the process of securing an Oracle database but with a proper
focus to the task rather than simply following a checklist. A checklist is
fine for general hardening but not for securing data as there is no method
to ensure that the data that must be protected has indeed been protected.

7:30pm - 8:30pm "SQL Injection - how far does the rabbit hole go? " - Justin
Clarke 

SQL Injection has been around for over 10 years, and yet it is still to this
day not truly understood by many security professionals and developers. With
the recent mass attacks against sites across the world it has again come to
the fore of vulnerabilities under the spotlight, however many consider it to
only be a data access issue, or parameterized queries to be a panacea.
Explore some of the deeper, darker danger areas of SQL Injection, hybrid
attacks, and exploiting obscure database functionality, and what we could
possibly expect to see next out of this venerable application security
issue. 


Speaker Bio's 

Jason Alexander 

Currently a Security Specialist working for the NHS Technology Office. Jason
has over 8 years of information security experience in a variety of business
and public sectors from ISP's to government. Jason has a keen interest in
web application and web services security and is the Leeds Chapter Leader.

Pete Finningan 

Pete Finnigan specialises in the Security of Oracle databases. Pete has been
interested in Oracle Security for many years and more recently in generally
database security. Pete has also written the book "Oracle Security
Step-by-step" and has produced many papers on the subject of oracle
security. Pete has also produced a number of security tools that can aid in
securing a database. More information can be found at Pete's web site
http://www.petefinnigan.com

Justin Clarke 

Justin has over 12 years experience in testing the security of networks, web
applications and wireless networks for large financial, retail and
technology clients from all around the globe. Justin is a contributing
author to a number of security books and author of the book "SQL Injection
Attacks and Defense" as well as a speaker at many conferences including
Black Hat USA, RSA, SANS and OWASP. He is the author of the open source
SQLBrute blind SQL injection exploitation tool, and is the chapter leader
for the London chapter of OWASP.

Everyone is welcome to join us at our chapter meetings. Don't forget to
