Would have helped if I'd confirmed my membership of these lists before
trying to send from this account - doh!

Second try...

Hi Manchester folks,
cc Leeds and London,

I'm pleased to announce that the first Manchester OWASP meeting is
confirmed.
Its on Wednesday 24th August and is being hosted by KPMG.
OK, so we've already had 2 meetings in Manchester, but they were part of the
Leeds chapter - this is the first of 'our own' ;)

We've got 2 great talks lined up:

   - SSL: Paved with Good Intentions
   Speaker: Richard Moore, CTO Westpoint Ltd <http://www.westpoint.ltd.uk/>


   - Forensic Readiness ? Give your investigators a fighting chance
   Speaker: Ryan Jones,
SpiderLabs<https://www.trustwave.com/spiderLabs.php>Incident Response
Team leader

And we've got time for another speaker if anyone else volunteers - just get
in touch with me or one of the other chapter leaders.

For more info and to book on the event please see:

Cheers,

Simon
