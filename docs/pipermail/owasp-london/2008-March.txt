Subject: [Owasp-london] Agenda for the meeting on April 3rd
Message-ID: <47E13088.9070504@webkreator.com>

Dear OWASP London subscribers,

Our next meeting will take place on Thursday, April 3rd, at the Auriol
Kensington Rowing Club. Follow the link below for more information how
to get there:

   http://www.akrowing.com/page.php?page=findus

The official part will run between 7pm and 9pm, with half an
hour between and after for socialising (the whole event thus
beginning at 6:30pm and ending at 9:30pm).

We are lucky to have three interesting speakers tonight, whose
talks' summaries are below. We will also have a short discussion
at the end, the topic of which I will introduce in a separate email.

- PHP Code Analysis: Real World Examples (David Kierznowski)

   We delve beyond register_globals and analyse real world examples
   of insecure PHP applications.

- Abusing PHP sockets for fun and profit (Rodrigo Marcos)

   PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side HTML embedded
   scripting language which provides web developers with a full suite of
   tools for building dynamic websites. PHP socket library implements a
   low-level interface to the socket communication functions based on the
   popular BSD sockets. This presentation will focus on the use of PHP
   socket library from an offensive point of view, demonstrating
   interesting and creative vectors of attack.

- Web Application Security Badges (Colin Watson)

   Web site and web application operators can apply to third party
   organisations to request their seal of approval that the web site is
   safe from hackers.  These security seals are part of a broad
   collection of badges that web sites can display, but what are they
   testing, should consumers trust them and how do you compare one with
   another?

I am looking forward to seeing many of you again.

Subject: [Owasp-london] Nominating OWASP for the Best Practice Challenge
	2008 award
Message-ID: <47E13222.7070800@webkreator.com>

Colin sent me an email, some time ago, proposing that we nominate OWASP 
for one of the awards in the Best Practice Challenge 2008, which is 
organised by Nominet:

    http://www.nic.uk/about/bestpracticechallenge/

There are 3 categories (out of 6) where we could fit:

  - Best development project award
  - Best security initiative award
  - Raising industry standards award

I thought that was a fantastic idea. The award, when we win it, will not 
only make us feel good about ourselves but hopefully also help us 
promote our goals and raise awareness further.

We can discuss this proposal here, if you wish, but also during our next 
meeting on April 3rd.

Ivan

I spoke to Nominet about how 'UK' the entries need to be.  They didn't seem to be too concerned, but suggested focusing on work in the UK or UK based people where possible.  However, they seem particularly keen on anything which helps developing countries achieve best practice - which international projects can do.

They have sent some printed leaflets which I'll bring along to the meeting on 3rd April.
