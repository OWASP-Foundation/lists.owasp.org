<PRE>All,

 

This is the reminder for the forthcoming full-day OWASP training on OWASP
projects and resources on this Friday May 28, 2010.  Signup is open for the
April session (see links at the bottom of the email) and we have 8 spaces
remaining (we have 27 OWASP'ers have RSVP'd, plus Lloyds&#146; staff who will be
attending). RSVP closes Wednesday 3pm, so get signed up now! Please note
that this training is free, but is currently open to only OWASP Members.
However, if you've been looking for a good reason to join as an OWASP Member
its only USD$50 to join for a year (approximately &#163;33 at current exchange
rates). 

&#167;  Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project</A>&gt; OWASP Projects are
not widely used and understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of
quality and usefulness of those Document &amp; Tool projects, but due to a lack
of understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem or
in the Web Application Development Life-cycle.

&#167;  This course aims to change that by providing a selection of mature and
enterprise ready projects together with practical examples of how to use
them.

&#167;  If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of the
course, please bring a laptop.

 

To sign up for the courses, follow the registration links from here -
