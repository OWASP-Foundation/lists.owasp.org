Subject: [Owasp-london] Reminder - Next London OWASP meeting Thursday the
 14th of January, at Nomura in the City
Message-ID: <C7677C24.160F6%justin.clarke@owasp.org>

This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to be
held on January 14th (next Thursday), at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue
between 6pm-6:30pm).

We're at a new location this time, at Nomura who have kindly agreed to let
us use their facilities:

- Nomura, Nomura House, 1 St Martins-le-Grand, London EC1A 4NP

Should be easier to find this time - this is near to St Pauls in the City,
and Google Maps etc should be more accurate this time around for showing you
where it is.

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should
have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well
and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at
http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com. Note, please enter your real name, as
this will be given to Nomura building security. If you don't RSVP, you may
not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close midday the day of
the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in
advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at
justin.clarke at owasp.org so your space can be released for someone else.

==Talks==

* Top Ten Deployment Mistakes That Render SSL Useless - Ivan Ristic

SSL is the technology that secures the Internet, but it only works when
properly configured. Unfortunately, because SSL is assumed to be easy to use
(and it genuinely is), there is a lack of information how to use it
properly. As a result, too many web sites use insecure deployment practices
that render SSL completely useless. In this talk I will present a list of
top ten (or thereabout) deployment mistakes, based on my work on the SSL
Labs assessment platform.

*  Using Selenium to hold state for web application penetration testing -
Yiannis Pavlosoglou

Selenium is a web application testing framework often used for unit testing
and functional testing during the later parts of web application
development. This presentation examines how this tool, in particular the
Selenium IDE <http://seleniumhq.org> , can be used for creating security
unit tests. By emulating a systematic logon, logoff or browse to a
particular location, web application penetration tests can be performed
using Selenium. Furthermore, fuzzing payloads can be scripted as inputs for
security tests. As a result, issues of holding state, or having valid
authentication credentials to test a particular input for, say, Cross Site
Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection can be performed in a much shorter time
duration. This presentation will take the audience through the process of
setting up, scripting and running Selenium against a vulnerable web
application. It's aim is to relay back one successful approach that has been
used in the field in order to discover vulnerabilities through stateful
fuzzing. 


==Speakers==

Ivan Ristic is a respected security expert and book author, known especially
for his contribution to the web application firewall field and the
development of ModSecurity, an open source web application firewall. He is
the author of Apache Security, a comprehensive security guide for the Apache
web server. A frequent speaker at computer security conferences, Ivan is an
active participant in the application security community, member of the Open
Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and officer of the Web Application
Security Consortium (WASC).

Coming from a solid academic background in information security, Yiannis has
spent a number of years in industry, formerly with companies such as Verizon
and Ounce Labs. He is the managing partner at Seleucus Ltd, based in London.

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the
chapter page ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London ).

See you there!

Justin, can you set some time to talk about the plans to do training in
London? (I also remember that there was some requests for us (or somebody)
to give an update of what happened at OWASP since the last chapter meeting)

We could do this at the beginning or at the middle (before the 2nd session)

Also, would it be worthwhile to have a number of print-outs of the latest
OWASP Newsletter?

Lets take 10-15 minutes in middle. Presumably Yiannis won?t mind us talking
while he?s getting setup.

As for newsletters ? can we get a (virtual) show of hands who would want a
physical copy?  Yiannis also has some ?OWASP Member sticky things? as
handouts if you?re an OWASP member!

Selenium is a web application testing framework often used for unit testing

unit tests. By emulating a systematic logon, logoff or browse to a

OWASP-London, anybody more details about this event, or has a good contact

Also, If we are able to get a slot for OWASP, anybody interested in going
there to present it?
