Subject: [Owasp-london] Final Reminder/Changes to the night - Next London
 OWASP meeting Thursday the 9th of July, at Barclays in Canary Wharf
Message-ID: <C6743030.EA38%justin.clarke@owasp.org>

* Note we have a couple of changes for the evening. Both Dinis and myself
will be in the US next week, and as such we have a change to the talks on
the evening (we'll reschedule Dinis's talk for a future meeting). Also,
Colin Watson will be stepping in to run this particular chapter meeting on
the night *


This is the final reminder for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting
to be held on July 9th (Thursday), at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue
between 6pm-6:30pm).

We're at the same location as the last meeting, however in a different room
this time, at Barclays who have kindly agreed to sponsor the evening:

Barclays, Rooms 42/43, One Churchill Place, London E14 5HP

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should
have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well.

If you are planning to attend please RSVP. As mentioned at the last meeting,
we're trialling an event signup system, so please RSVP at
http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com. Note, please enter your real name, as
this will be given to Barclays building security to ensure you are let into
the building.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at
justin.clarke at owasp.org so your space can be released for someone else.

* Auditing C# Code - Ilja van Sprundel

In this presentation, Ilja van Sprundel, Principal Consultant at IOActive,
will discuss reviewing C# code, specifically C# code used for ASP.NET. He
will cover entrypoints, exit points, .NET input validators, corner cases of
API's, integer rules, managed vs unmanaged code, the garbage collector,
exception handling issues, XSS cases, SQL Injection bugs, XML handling
issues and usage of Anti-XSS.

* The Ultimate IDS Smackdown - How red vs. blue situations can influence
more than one might assume - Mario Heiderich and Gareth Heyes

The talk is a vector and coding showdown between the lead dev of the PHPIDS
and one of its most determined challengers trying and managing to break it
wherever possible. Expect a bloody battle between security researchers and
developers without limits, regular expression magic against code obfuscation
excellence leading to an interesting result about vs-situations in software
development and IT security.

Speakers

* Mario Heiderich - I am Mario Heiderich, cologne based CTO for an online
enterprise based in Cologne and New York. I was visitor and speaker on
several OWASP conferences, maintain the PHPIDS and other security related
projects and recently authored a German book on Web Security together with
Christian Matthies, fukami and Johannes Dahse. I am currently into browser
security, broken markup, client side attacks and digging the HTML5
specifications.

* Gareth Heyes - I'm from the UK and I like hacking javascript and XSS
filters. I am not a security expert, in fact I'm the anti-security expert.
Don't expect statistics from me, I like vectors and interesting code. I
authored Hackvertor and many other security related tools.

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the
chapter page ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London ).

See you there!

Subject: [Owasp-london] Eventbrite - event registration cross site scripting
Message-ID: <C6743411.EA42%justin.clarke@owasp.org>

As an aside, can whoever put "<script>alert('OWASP_XSS');</script> ' or 1=1;
--" in as their name in the event RSVP report this to Evenbrite? It is
vulnerable to XSS.

Good morning,
 
I have recently joined the OWASP mailing list and would like to ask the following questions:
 
1. Are any meetings scheduled for any location outside of London?
 
2. Is there any interest in holding meetings outside of London?
 
3. Would Harrogate be an acceptable alternative location?
 
I look forward to hearing from you.
 
Best regards

Hi David,

There is currently 3 OWASP chapters in the UK - London, Scotland
(Edinburgh), and North (Leeds). London and Scotland are both active
chapters, North is still in setup for the most part
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Leeds_UK). I imagine that might be a bit
more convenient that heading down this way? :-)

Jason is the one trying to get this coordinated (email on the Leeds UK
chapter page) - you might want to drop him a line and help get the chapter
off the ground.  We?ve been in touch in the past, and are willing to help
out with getting stuff arranged (i.e. speakers) as you need it.

Best regards

Justin

	date 31 July 2009

Hi all,

The IET Innovation Awards are organised by the Institute of
Engineering and Technology, here in the UK and aim to give your work
(in this case OWASP's work in the UK:) the chance to be recognised and
celebrated as a product, technology or process that is shaping our
world!

Part of the submission we filed last year was JBroFuzz as an OWASP
tool within the security category (there are over 15 categories). We
are attempting to make a more solid submission this year, with regards
to what the chapters in the UK are doing, as well as include a generic
tool and document listing.

So this year, as part of our submission, we are aiming to show some or
most of the material that OWASP generates in the UK.

Now the bad news is that we have left it to the last week of the
submission before requesting your input (actually 2 days, 7 hours)!

So please, if you have material that can be included in our OWASP UK
submission to the IET come forward and email me off the list, before
the submission deadline. Remember this information will be reviewed
and assessed from an engineering perspective, so please try to make it
as consise as possible. Technical is also welcome.

At this stage, a short email of what you are doing for OWASP (whether
its tool work, chapter work, documents, etc.) would more than likely
increase our chance of winning if we include it in our submission.

Many Thanks,

Yiannis
