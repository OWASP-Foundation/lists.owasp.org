   and Chapter Update from the OWASP London Chapter Leaders


   - *Drones and their Flaws - Aatif Khan*Drones or Unmanned Aerial
   Vehicles (UAVs), have undoubtedly attained a prominent position in
   contemporary and future defense technologies. It has been increasingly used
   for Surveillance, Reconnaissance and have been planned to stop crude oil
   theft, to deliver online shopping products and even pizza. It remains
   important to understand their security and implication. This talk will
   explore different kind of drones and their associated vulnerabilities hence
   giving chance to audience to understand their flaws and work for
   anti-hacking solutions.


   - *How (NOT) to Code Your Ransomware - Liviu Itoafa*The presentation
   will start with a history of ransomware from simple lockers to recent
   trends. Although currently ransomware follows good secure development
   practices, this is not always the case. We'll see in what circumstances we
   can get our files back and how. This will make you think twice before
   paying the ransom and, for some samples, think twice before clicking that
   tempting link for 'summer photos'.
