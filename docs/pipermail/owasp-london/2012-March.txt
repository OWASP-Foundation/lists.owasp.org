   - *Securing the SSL channel against man-in-the-middle attacks: Future
   technologies - HTTP Strict Transport Security and and Pinning of Certs -
   Tobias Gondrom*

"In the recent months major trusted CAs providing trusted certificates for
SSL/TLS in browser scenarios were compromised (e.g. seen in the Diginotar
breach) and based on the current trust models (trusting all registered CAs
equally for all domains) exposed vital web applications to the risk of
man-in-the-middle attacks. Several approaches are currently discussed to
mitigate this risk. The most advanced and closest to final adoption being
the technologies discussed by the browser vendors at the recent IETF
meeting in November in Taipei: HSTS and pinning of certificates. To better
protect content providers against the distribution of bogus certificates,
an HTTP header extension containing a fingerprint of their certificates
linked to a domain address has been defined. This approach, which has been
partly tested in Chrome, and already helped identify and protect to some
extend Google's web application in the recent Diginotar compromise. Chrome
users were able to detect the bogus DigiNotar certificates because Chrome
had embedded the hashes of valid Google certificates. Back in July, the
hacked DigiNotar certificate authority (CA), which has since gone out of
business, was used to issue more than five hundred bogus certificates for
companies including Google and various intelligence services."

   - *Implementing cryptography: good theory vs. bad practice - Viet Pham*

Abstract: Cryptography is being widely implemented in software to provide
security features. The main reason is that, many cryptographic mechanisms
are mathematically proven secure, or trusted secure given some mathematical
reasoning. However, to take full advantages of these mechanisms, they must
be implemented strictly according to the theoretical models, e.g., several
cryptographic mechanisms must be used together, in a specific manner to
provide a desired security goal. However, without strong cryptographic
background, many software developers tend to deviate from these models,
thus making their own security software a gold mine for attackers. This
talk gives examples to show why such situations exist, where do they
spread, and how bad they may turn into.

Subject: [Owasp-london] Announcement - Next Central London OWASP meeting
	Thursday the 29th of March, at Morgan Stanley in Canary Wharf
Message-ID: <7AD11727-99A9-4E66-B4CD-A64472FB4F44@owasp.org>

This is the announcement for the forthcoming OWASP Central London chapter meeting to be held on Thursday March 29th, at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between 6:00pm-6:30pm).  We have a special treat in the form of an international OWASP Speaker being in town (Jim Manico) who has kindly agreed to speak.

We're at a new location this time, at Morgan Stanley who have kindly agreed to let us use their facilities:

- Morgan Stanley, 25 Cabot Square, Canary Wharf, London E14 4QA (Wordsworth and Yeats rooms, Level 12)

Note that we're back to our normal time!

As always, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

Even though this meeting is free and open to all, if you are planning to attend you must RSVP at http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com. Please enter your real name, as this will be given to Morgan Stanley building security. If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close the day before the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at justin.clarke at owasp.org so your space can be released for someone else.

==Talks==

	? Deep Access Control Best Practices and Anti-Patterns - Jim Manico
Access Control is a necessary security control at almost every layer within a web application. This talk will discuss several of the key access control anti-patterns commonly found during website security audits. These access control anti-patterns include hard-coded security policies, lack of horizontal access control, and "fail open" access control mechanisms. In reviewing these and other access control problems, we will discuss and design a positive access control mechanism that is data contextual, activity based, configurable, flexible, and deny-by-default - among other positive design attributes that make up a robust web-based access-control mechanism.

	? IronWASP - Manish Saindane
IronWASP (Iron Web application Advanced Security testing Platform) is an open source system for web application vulnerability testing. It is designed to be customizable to the extent where users can create their own custom security scanners using it. Though an advanced user with Python/Ruby scripting expertise would be able to make full use of the platform, a lot of the tool's features are simple enough to be used by absolute beginners.

==Speakers==

	? Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security, a web security firm. Jim is a participant and project manager of the OWASP Developer Cheatsheet series. He is also the producer and host of the OWASP Podcast Series.
	? Manish Saindane is a Senior Security Consultant at Gotham Digital Science. He also co-authors a security research website and bloghttp://andlabs.org. He has actively contributed towards conceptualising IronWASP and also maintains the Ruby plug-in repository for this framework.

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the chapter page (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London).

See you there!

West Londoners, what do you think of doing an owasp chapter meeting in
Hammersmith?

We used to do them ages ago at AK rowing club, and we always had a good
turn out (and one that was quite a different crowd from the one we get in
central London)

So what about next Wed 28th of March <x-apple-data-detectors://0>. Jim
Manico might be able to present (he is also presenting next day at the
Owasp meeting at Canary Wharf) and we might be able to get a couple more
presenters.

I support the idea. It would be worthwhile doing it. It will give us the opportunity to network with a?group of people who can't go to central London for the talk.

Hi folks,

Are you (or do you know) a student who would like to get paid to work
on an OWASP project over the summer?

Please see the attached email and documents from Fabio.

I think this is a great opportunity, both for OWASP and students
interested in appsec!

Please spread the word!

Cheers,

Simon

Subject: [Owasp-london] Reminder - Next Central London OWASP meeting on
	Thursday the 29th of March, at Morgan Stanley in Canary Wharf
Message-ID: <195961A1-94D4-456C-8FA3-6379D46E5444@owasp.org>

**** We are nearing capacity for this event. Remember to release your slot if you can no longer make it by replying to this email ****

This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP Central London chapter meeting to be held next Thursday (March 29th) at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between 6:00pm-6:30pm).  We have a special treat in the form of an international OWASP Speaker being in town (Jim Manico) who has kindly agreed to speak. 

We're at a new location this time, at Morgan Stanley who have kindly agreed to let us use their facilities:

- Morgan Stanley, 25 Cabot Square, Canary Wharf, London E14 4QA (Wordsworth and Yeats rooms, Level 12)

Note that we're back to our normal time!

As always, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

Even though this meeting is free and open to all, if you are planning to attend you must RSVP at http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com. Please enter your real name, as this will be given to Morgan Stanley building security. If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close the day before the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at justin.clarke at owasp.org so your space can be released for someone else.

==Talks==

? Deep Access Control Best Practices and Anti-Patterns - Jim Manico
Access Control is a necessary security control at almost every layer within a web application. This talk will discuss several of the key access control anti-patterns commonly found during website security audits. These access control anti-patterns include hard-coded security policies, lack of horizontal access control, and "fail open" access control mechanisms. In reviewing these and other access control problems, we will discuss and design a positive access control mechanism that is data contextual, activity based, configurable, flexible, and deny-by-default - among other positive design attributes that make up a robust web-based access-control mechanism.

? IronWASP - Manish Saindane
IronWASP (Iron Web application Advanced Security testing Platform) is an open source system for web application vulnerability testing. It is designed to be customizable to the extent where users can create their own custom security scanners using it. Though an advanced user with Python/Ruby scripting expertise would be able to make full use of the platform, a lot of the tool's features are simple enough to be used by absolute beginners.

==Speakers==

? Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat Security, a web security firm. Jim is a participant and project manager of the OWASP Developer Cheatsheet series. He is also the producer and host of the OWASP Podcast Series.
? Manish Saindane is a Senior Security Consultant at Gotham Digital Science. He also co-authors a security research website and blog http://andlabs.org. He has actively contributed towards conceptualising IronWASP and also maintains the Ruby plug-in repository for this framework.

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the chapter page (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London).

See you there!

? Top Ten Web Defences - Jim Manico
We cannot hack or firewall our way secure. Application programmers need to learn to code in a secure fashion if we have any chance of providing organizations with proper defenses in the current threatscape. This talk will discuss the 10 most important security-centric computer programming techniques necessary to build low-risk web based applications.

All,

Looks like we've had a lot of interest for tomorrow's meeting, and we're expecting about 80 attendees on the day. We're currently at capacity, so if you're not able to make it let me know so that we can have someone from the wait list join us on the day!

Best regards

Subject: [Owasp-london] White Hat Rally
Message-ID: <5AC05BFE-452C-45AB-A6F1-94BC6F9B38C5@owasp.org>

All,

For those of you not aware, one of the UK information security industry's main annual charity events is coming up soon - the White Hat Rally. While we don't normally send this kind of thing out to the list, they are currently looking for teams and sponsors (proceeds to help children via Barnardo's) so I thought I'd pass this on.

Best regards

Justin

Message-ID: <0B4B8D55-D307-462A-894C-95F30EC3059B@owasp.org>

Thanks to all that attended - hopefully everyone had a good time (I certainly did!).

Slides for last nights talks are up on the London page at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London

Next Central London event is going to be something a bit different too - we have an all-day AppSec conference event to be held in conjunction with the ISSA. That event will be free for OWASP (and ISSA members), and we'll be announcing details and a CFP soon. If you're not an OWASP member, remember that to join is only $50 for a year (about ?32 at current exchange rates), so will work out to a very reasonably priced event in any case.

Best regards

Justin
