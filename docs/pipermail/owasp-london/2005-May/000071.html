<PRE>Hello

I am happy to announce that for the next month (9th May till 9th June)
Sandra Paiva will be working for Owasp DotNet as a project manager.

She is a very good friend and a highly capable and productive person.
She is going to work full time since she will be paid by my UK company
(DDPlus) for this (she just moved from Portugal to London and is
still figuring out what she will do here, so this is a win-win situation)

Please welcome her

...and since she will be focused 100% on owasp, send her all current
'to-do lists'. :)

Note that although she is being hired for Owasp DotNet work (and we have
a lot of work in there) everybody else will be more than welcome to
'use' her services for any type of Owasp work.

Her first jobs will be to:
     1) finish the owasp.net website (based on DNN) since it is almost
finished and I want to officially launch it next Saturday on the UK
conference 'Developers Developers Developers' which is occurring in
Microsoft's offices in Reading and where I am delivering the
presentation entitled &quot;The OWASP .NET Tools / Full Trust ASP.NET
(in)security &quot; (see <A HREF="http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/agenda.htm">http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/agenda.htm</A> for
more details)
    2) help other owasp projects/chapters who want to use DNN to create
their web pages (she will start by clearing the backlog of requests for
Blogs and Message Boards)
    3) document all owasp .NET project and see which ones can be made
into 'products'
    4) Issue a press release regarding the launch of the new owasp.net
website and its community in the UK
    5) manage the creating of the 'Owasp .NET Top Ten Vulnerabilities'
and 'Owasp .NET Top Ten Best Practices' documents
    6) Help Jeff to make a list of all mailing lists so that we can send
emails globally to all Owasp members
    7) Work with Dinis (and the owasp dotNet community) in sending
comments to Jeff's presentation of the new Owasp Subscription model
    8) Work with the current Owasp members working on the new version of
the 'Testing Guide' and with Barry from Intense School to see if the
current ideas of creating a course based on that content become reality

That should keep her busy for a couple of days :)

Welcome on board Sandra

Dinis Cruz
Owasp .Net Project Leader
