Hi guys,

I was not able to catch the beginning of the discussion, i was away in
California (poor me) for one month.

I have a project that might interest people, here is the oulines:


Secure communication Framework

The goal is to offer a secure layer of
communication using a well managed PKI, to tiers applications, users
or systems. This layer would be on the top of any operating system,
and just under the application layer.
This would be a multi-platform software
( Windows, Mac OS, Linux, embeded OS)
The general system would be highly
distributed, without real central point, apart from some specialized
components, like the certification authority.

The main parts would be : 
	* Automated certificate generation,
distribution and revocation (as far as it is applicable).
	* Integrated authentication via
certificate.
	* Messaging protocol offered for tier
applications, this would include a complete routing system and a naming
system.
	* Possibility for any application to
use the certificate or to use a secure channel from the framework.
	* multi-platform: Windows, Mac OS,
Linux, embeded OS, ... (Mainly due to the use of Qt framework: http://trolltech.com/products/qt/ )

Potentials applications:
	* Secure Instant messaging
	* Secure VOIP
	* Secure administration of complex
network, from user stations to servers, including switches, firewall,
routers.
	* User mobility management (laptop,
phone, PDA)
Let me know if that sounds good, and if this funding is also open to
non-UK people (french as a matter of fact)

Hi Colin, this is definitely something very interesting which we should try to incorporate with the next Season of Code (I especially like they 'up to 150k' fast track process)

Do you know anybody there?

I thought this may be of interest to some people on the list:

  Information Infrastructure Protection: Managing complexity, risk
and resilience
  MARCH 2009 COMPETITION FOR FUNDING
  http://www.innovateuk.org/_assets/pdf/competitioninformationinfrastructprotection1.pdf

>From the document:

"Projects should make real progress towards meeting the targets set
out in the UK Government's National Information Assurance Strategy and
mitigating electronic risks cited in the National Risk Register. These
take the form of clear and effective risk management; provision of the
right 'tools' for organisations to protect themselves; protection of
critical infrastructures from electronic attack; and enhanced public,
commercial, and industrial confidence in the UK's ability to manage
and protect information."

"All proposals must explain how the work will help in positioning the
UK in the global market and against other global innovation leaders in
the area. Projects should be mindful of how they might contribute to
the European Commission ICT Objective 1.4 Secure, Dependable and
Trusted Infrastructures and Objective 1.7 Critical Infrastructure
Protection."

Hi Colin, I don't think we will have problems finding projects/initiatives
within OWASP that match their criteria, the problem (in my point of view) is
finding somebody who is going to dedicate the time required to make this
happen.

Hence the reason why I think that a SoC 09 grant is one of the most
realistic avenues :)

Gabriel:

I think Dinis' comments about the forthcoming OWASP Season of Code '09
is probably the best bet.

Dinis:

I agree.  If anyone would like to progress matters with the TSB'c
competition, the first step might be for someone interested to make
initial contact and attend the 'optional' briefing day on 1st April.

Subject: [Owasp-london] Reminder - next meeting: March 12th, KPMG,
	Canary Wharf
Message-ID: <C5D2F62A.8D10%justin@justinclarke.com>

This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to be
held on March 12th (Thursday), at the earlier time of 6:30pm (like the
previous meeting).

The location is the same as for the previous meeting, at KPMG who have
kindly agreed to sponsor the evening:

     KPMG, 39th Floor, One Canada Sq, E14 5AG

We have the following talks confirmed. I will send out one final reminder
next week before the meeting.

*  OWASP Global Industry Committee - Colin Watson
- The Global Industry Committee was one of six new OWASP committees created
during the EU Summit in Portugal last year. Colin Watson will talk about the
committee's aims, plan, how to get involved, who it has been engaging with
and what else it has been doing in the first few months.

Colin Watson's initial work was in the production and process engineering
fields, but since completing an MSc in Computation at the University of
Oxford in 1995, he has been employed in web software development, with an
increasing focus on the security aspects. He is now a consultant in London
working with developers, testers, auditors and people from a non-IT
background such as business owners, managers, marketers, project specifiers
and designers to improve security practices. Colin joined the OWASP Global
Industry Committee in January.

* The Software Assurance Maturity Model - Introduction and a Use Case - Matt
Bartoldus
- The OWASP CLASP Project has been going through modification to move more
towards a maturity model. As a result, the Software Assurance Maturity Model
(SAMM) project has been released in a beta version. The goal is to "define a
usable security framework with sequential, measurable goals that can be used
by small, medium, and large organisations in any line of business that
involves software development". This talk will introduce SAMM and give a
brief overview of its contents. We will then discuss how SAMM is currently
being used to measure the level of information security activities within an
EU based financial organisation's development methodology and providing the
framework for implementing such activities into their everyday development
activities (SDLC). 

Matt Bartoldus is an information risk management professional with over 10
years of experience managing and delivering information security projects.
Service delivery experience spans the scope of security penetration and
vulnerability assessments; regulatory compliance and information security
governance consulting; policy and standard development; and security
business transformation. Matt is a Co-Founder of and Director at Gotham
Digital Science in London.

* SQL injection: Not only AND 1=1 - Bernardo Damele A. G.

The presentation will cover a quick preamble on SQL injection definition,
sqlmap and its key features. It will then illustrate the details of common
and uncommon problems and respective solutions with examples that a
penetration tester or a SQL injection tool developer faces when he wants to
take advantage of any kind of web application SQL injection flaw on real
world web applications, for instance SQL injection in ORDER BY and LIMIT
clauses, single entry UNION query SQL injection, blind SQL injection
algorithm speed enhancements, specific web application technologies IDS
bypasses and more.

Bernardo Damele A. G. is an IT security engineer based in London (United
Kingdom) currently employed as penetration tester and security researcher
for a renowned security company. Bernardo spent most of his research time on
web application and database management systems security. He is currently
the lead developer of sqlmap, a MySQL UDF repository developer and a
Metasploit contributor.

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and it
looks like we could have a very good turnout from the number of RSVPs we've
received so far. 

If you are planning to attend please RSVP in an email to Hayley French from
KPMG (hayley.french at kpmg.co.uk) and CC me (justin at justinclarke.com).

As always, the details and schedule for the night is available on the
chapter page
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London).

See you there!

Justin Clarke

Dear UK Chapters

Further to my previous email, thank you for your input - especially
Ceri for his extended advice and final review of this version.  This
first draft of our submission to the Digital Britain Report is
available in PDF format on:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Industry:Digital_Britain_Interim_Report

This has been drafted in conjunction with other members of these
mailing lists and draws heavily on information already published on
the OWASP website.  However, the language and focus relate
specifically to the context of the report.  For example, we have
avoided using the word "vulnerability" since "vulnerable groups" is
currently heavily used in the document, and use "defects" instead.
OWASP is referred to in the third person, and "we" and "our" are
reserved for society in general.

Your further comments, via these lists or directly, are welcome so
that we may produce an updated version in the next few days, with a
view to asking approval from the Industry Committee on Monday or
Tuesday next week.

Regards

Colin Watson
Global Industry Committee

Subject: Looking for someone to present to staff

 
 Hello 

I am looking for someone technical with an ability to demonstrate and
present, in layman's terms, to key staff, both technical and non
technical, the threat of hacking sites. I imagine 2 sittings. One in
Bristol and one in London, cc20 people at each.

What for? I would like to reinforce the case for testing during the SDLC
with the help of OWASP tools. What I want to do is show the audience what
can happen today. I believe there is a need to educate those who
commission sites and provide them with the understanding and appreciation
for testing. I thought of approaching the OWASP community but I do not
know who to ask. Maybe you can help?

IOP Publishing are a non profit organisation owned by a charity, the
Institute of Physics Publishing in central London. The Bristol office
provides revenue through publishing to promote physics. At the London
office they also have a conference centre (again, revenue for promoting
physics) which could be of interest. However I cannot make any promises
but will approach if the conference director if space is desirable for an
OWASP gathering. Can you please advise numbers if so. There is a link for
info http://www.76portlandplace.com/ with a rather flowery video but at
least you do get to see the conference rooms.

With regard to the individual/s reimbursements, expenses can be paid for,
I may also be able to secure something extra for consultancy too. However
if the conference space is of interest perhaps we can do something there.

Thank you for your attention, I hope you can help.

Message-ID: <C5E55D64.96B0%justin@justinclarke.com>

Thank you all for the great turnout, and a good bit of socialisation after
the talks.  A quick note to say that two of the three presentations are now
available on the OWASP London site (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London),
and I expect that I'll be able to get Bernardo's slide deck uploaded soon as
well.

As discussed in the meeting, I'll be aiming to organise meetings every two
months as we go forward, and that's something that I'd like to solicit a bit
of help with. We are on the lookout for organisations that can host an OWASP
meeting, either in the city or Canary Wharf areas strongly preferred.
Although I'll be approaching many of my contacts in the security industry to
get this arranged, if your company has space that we could use in the
evenings (even once a year) for a meeting of 30-40 people, then that would
be much appreciated.  Think of it as giving a little back, as well as
helping us to build the strong OWASP community that I know we can in London.

More updates as logistics are arranged and firmed up.  Don't forget to get
your friends and colleagues who are interested in OWASP to sign up to the
mailing list so they get updated on meetings. And if you're on LinkedIn -
sign up for the OWASP London group to get updates through that medium as
well.

Best regards

Description
????
The emergence of Web 2.0 technologies brought about the extensive
deployment and use of web-based applications and web services. Such
applications are easy to develop and deploy and demonstrate impressive
features for users, resulting in their current wide use. Nonetheless,
the level of security in web applications doesn?t seem to go along
with their popularity: important security issues have been found and
privacy concerns have also been raised recently. In addition, the
Cloud Computing paradigm promises even greater flexibility; however
corresponding security and privacy issues still need to be examined.
This track aims to bring together application security experts,
researchers, educators and practitioners from the industry, academia
and international communities such as OWASP, in order to discuss open
problems and new solutions in application security. In the context of
this track academic researchers will be able to combine interesting
results with the experience of practitioners and software engineers.

Suggested topics include (but are not limited to):
?       Secure application development
?       Security of service oriented architectures
?       Threat modeling of web applications
?       Cloud computing security
?       Web applications vulnerabilities and analysis
?       Countermeasures for web application vulnerabilities
?       Secure coding techniques
?       Platform or language security features that help secure web
applications
?       Secure database usage in web applications
?       Access control in web applications
?       Web services security
?       Browser security
?       Privacy in web applications
?       Standards, certifications and security evaluation criteria for
web applications
