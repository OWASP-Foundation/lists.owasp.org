All,

In the run up to the holiday break we have one more OWASP meeting, coming up on Thursday the 12th of December at Morgan Stanley.

Talks confirmed so far:
	
? OWASP Cornucopia - Colin Watson
Microsoft's Escalation of Privilege (EoP) threat modelling card game has been refreshed into a new version more suitable for common web applications, and aligned with OWASP advice and guides. "OWASP Cornucopia - Ecommerce Web Application Edition" will be presented and used to demonstrate how it can help software architects and developers identify security requirements from the OWASP Secure Coding Practices - Quick Reference Guide. He will also provide a brief introduction about how to contribute ideas and content to OWASP projects, and how to start a project.

Bio:

He is project leader for the OWASP Codes of Conduct and OWASP Cornucopia projects, co-leader for the OWASP AppSensor project, wrote the Application Logging Cheat sheet.
