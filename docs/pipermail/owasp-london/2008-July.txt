The owasp mailing lists cannot be used for job postings!

We have created a special OWASP job board specifically for this:
http://www.owasp.org/careers/jobs.html

I'm CCing the owasp-leaders list since there are a couple new chapter
leaders who might not be aware of this.

Thanks

Message-ID: <486CA699.4070104@webkreator.com>

Some of you may recall a discussion about the Nominet Best Practice 
Challenge 2008 award. I eventually remembered to prepare and submit (on 
the very last day).

A few weeks ago I received an email from them telling us we've been 
shortlisted for the award.

The awards ceremony is on the 9th of July, and they won't tell us in 
advance if we've won.

Colin, Dinis and I will be attending the ceremony.

Just a quick note to mention that KPMG have graciously offered to 
sponsor OWASP London meetings starting with September. (Martin Jordan 
and Emmanouel Kellinis wrote to me recently.)

They've even promised drinks, which may help increase attendance ;)

More information in due course.

Hi,

Our next meeting is going to be on Thursday July 24th. As before, we are 
going to enjoy the beautiful location next to the Hammersmith bridge:

   http://www.akrowing.com/page.php?page=findus

As before, Breach Security is paying for the space. I have a ?100 
allocated for free drinks, so be sure to tell your friends. I feel like 
I've done a particularly bad job organising this meeting so I now have 
to find a way to make it up. I'd like to see at least 20 people at the 
meeting! Also, please RSVP if you can.


19:00 Dinis Cruz: What is going on at OWASP?

19:30 Ivan Ristic: Evaluation Criteria for Web Application Firewalls
       (talk from the recent OWASP AppSec Europe conference in Ghent).
       If there's interest I'd be happy to cut the talk short and have
       a discussion of what WAFs can and cannot do.

20:30 Dinis Cruz: Building a tool for Security consultants: A story
       of a customized source code scanner

21:00 The official programme is over, but we can continue to socialise
       for a while longer.

It turns out it's going to be a busy night, as we will also be squeezing 
in Dennis Hurst, who will be giving a light talk on AJAX/Web 2.0 security:

--BEGIN ABSTRACT--
This session will begin with a brief overview of AJAX , Web2.0 and Web 
Services (SOA) technologies and details of the underlying HTTP request 
that they use.  The talk will then address some of the vulnerabilities 
that are common to these technologies including issues with attacks that 
leverage AJAX implementation mistakes, bridge attacks that are common to 
web service implementations and with sufficient time we will cover some 
of the issues that are coming about related to browser embedded 
technologies such as the latest versions of flash and SilverLight.
--END ABSTRACT--

Dennis Hurst, who will be speaking at our next meeting (see my previous

***** Message follows ******

We would like to make a special offer to you and the people at OWASP as 
our way of thanking you for your support of our Lifecycle Security (web 
application security)Conference which we are holding the day after 
Blackhat-Vegas on August 8-9, 2008 at the Las Vegas Ceasar's Palace.

FREE ADMISSION (normal price is $350) for the first 100 people who 
register by sending an email to freeoffer at LifeCycleSecurity.com with:

Name:

E-mail:

We plan to open this up to other lists later in the week, but we want to 
give OWASP members "first shot" at the free admission.  (There are only 
100 free admission tickets.)

Our goal is to create a community where Application Security 
professionals can share information on an on-going basis.

We have Ounce, Proactive, Price Waterhouse, ModSecurity, Microsoft, Safe

Policy/Compliance/Solutions and a Vendor Tracks.

Hi everyone,

Our next meeting will be held at Canary Wharf, and it will be sponsored 
by KPMG. They operate a default deny access policy so we will be 
expected to provide a list of names of people who will be granted access.

The meeting will start at 7pm as usually. If you want to attend you 
_must_ send me your name at least one week in advance.

We will be looking for two talks for the evening. Both slots are 
available at the moment, so if you want to present and you have an 
interesting topic in mind please come forward.

Thanks, and enjoy the weather while it lasts.
