<PRE>Hello

Some thoughts.

My first reaction would be to ask whether you could start more modestly 
and try initially to get to ASVS level 1 compliance.

While ASVS is a good idea,  it doesn't seem to have gained great 
traction as of yet, so I reckon you would be one of the (fairly) early 
adopters.

Your questions:

a) There don't seem to be (m)any companies offering OWASP ASVS 
compliance audits
b) and d) I have come across a small number of organisations who discuss 
it - but few who have formally adopted it. The OWASP ASVS page has a 
list of &quot;ASVS users&quot; - <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS.">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS.</A> I haven't 
had much success in my efforts to introduce it!

c) Probably a good starting point would be to get copies of independent 
assessments.  Then of course who pays? For future projects you could 
look at specifying an ASVS level in the development contract.  There 
will be an associated cost with that - which your company will have to 
be willing to pay.

Im not sure that was very helpful - but some feedback anyway!

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In recent times our organisations Web development team asked our 
</I>&gt;<i> Internal Audit and Risk Management department if there were any 
</I>&gt;<i> industry best practice standards they should be adhering to around web 
</I>&gt;<i> development, or anything that they can reference in web development 
</I>&gt;<i> guides, and work towards in developing web applications with security 
</I>&gt;<i> in mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the time this was researched in great detail, and the only thing we 
</I>&gt;<i> could find and that was recommended that really ticked this box was 
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP ASVS. We agreed in principal that due to the type of 
</I>&gt;<i> applications we both develop and buy in, that they should all ideally 
</I>&gt;<i> be fully complaint with OWASP ASVS Level 2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With this in mind, our Web development team accordingly updated the 
</I>&gt;<i> web development policy to adhere to OWASP ASVS. Main issue being, some 
</I>&gt;<i> web applications used by our organisation are not internally 
</I>&gt;<i> developed, and in many cases are purchased from 3^rd parties, and 
</I>&gt;<i> hosted externally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In a nutshell, we are having real issues with 3^rd parties and trying 
</I>&gt;<i> to gauge their web applications compliance with OWASP ASVS. Many have 
</I>&gt;<i> never heard of OWASP ASVS, many claim &#8220;this OWASP ASVS is an excessive 
</I>&gt;<i> and ridiculous level of control, nobody can be expected to comply with 
</I>&gt;<i> all of this anywhere&#8221; etc etc, so I was wondering if anyone on the 
</I>&gt;<i> mailing lists has been in a similar position when dealing with these 
</I>&gt;<i> 3^rd parties and how you deal with them, or whether you are only 
</I>&gt;<i> responsible for internal developments as opposed to handling 
</I>&gt;<i> negotiations for 3^rd party application providers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main questions I wanted to run by the list was:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a)      OWASP ASVS is basically a detailed code review and penetration 
</I>&gt;<i> test. Have you come across 3^rd party penetration testing companies 
</I>&gt;<i> who provide OWASP ASVS compliance audits? If so can you provide some 
</I>&gt;<i> details? Is this a common service offered these days?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b)      Do you reference OWASP ASVS is your organisations internal web 
</I>&gt;<i> development policies, or is there any other industry standard document 
</I>&gt;<i> that you have come across? I&#8217;ve yet to come across any other 
</I>&gt;<i> organisation that references OWASP ASVS in any web development or web 
</I>&gt;<i> security policy, so just knowing that we aren&#8217;t out on a whim asking 
</I>&gt;<i> for OWASP ASVS 2 compliance would be reassuring to say the least!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> c)       If you have any involvement in testing a 3^rd parties 
</I>&gt;<i> compliance to OWASP ASVS for any 3^rd party apps your 
</I>&gt;<i> sector/organisation buys in, how do you go about checking for OWASP 
</I>&gt;<i> ASVS compliance? I.e. do you request copies of independent penetration 
</I>&gt;<i> testing and then review the scope, or ask for documented evidence that 
</I>&gt;<i> issues found in the pen test have been remediated? Or do you have a 
</I>&gt;<i> different approach, i.e. ask for some documented compliance per OWASP 
</I>&gt;<i> ASVS control etc, and then manually verify a sample of these controls?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> d)      Do you know anyone organisations who reference OWASP ASVS in 
</I>&gt;<i> their own internal web development policies that you could give me a 
</I>&gt;<i> contact for? Maybe you are on this list?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any response would be greatly appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
