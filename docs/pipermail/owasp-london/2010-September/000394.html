<PRE>This is the announcement for an OWASP London special meeting to be held on Friday October 1st, at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between 6:00pm-6:30pm).

This is to catch Samy Kamkar on his OWASP tour of Europe, so we are on a new day in a new venue (apologies for the late notice!)

We're at a new location this time, at Barclays Capital who have kindly agreed to let us use their facilities:
- Barclays Capital, 5 North Colonnade, Canary Wharf, London E14 4BB

As always, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at <A HREF="http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.">http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.</A> Note, please enter your real name, as this will be given to Barclays building security. If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close the afternoon of the day before the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">justin.clarke at owasp.org</A> so your space can be released for someone else.

===Talks===

* How I Met Your Girlfriend - Samy Kamkar
The discovery and execution of entirely new classes of attacks executed from the Web in order to meet your girlfriend. This includes newly discovered attacks including HTML5 client-side XSS (without XSS hitting the server!), PHP session hijacking and weak random numbers (accurately guessing PHP session cookies), browser protocol confusion (turning a browser into an SMTP server), firewall and NAT penetration via Javascript (turning your router against you), remote iPhone Google Maps hijacking (iPhone penetration combined with HTTP man-in-the-middle), extracting extremely accurate geolocation information from a Web browser (not using IP geolocation), and more

* Padding Oracle attacks (and ASP.NET 0-day) - Justin Clarke
Change of plan from the previous announcement - I'm going to go through Padding Oracle attacks (as recently re-popularised by Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo), as well as demoing the 0-day Padding Oracle attack on ASP.NET (time permitting). 

===Speakers===
* Samy Kamkar is best known for the Samy worm, the first XSS worm, infecting over one million users on MySpace in less than 24 hours. A co-founder of Fonality, Inc., an IP PBX company, Samy previously led the development of all top-level domain name server software and systems for Global Domains International (.ws). In the past 10 years, Samy has focused on evolutionary and genetic algorithmic software development, Voice over IP software development, automated security and vulnerability research in network security, reverse engineering, and network gaming. When not strapped behind the Matrix, Samy can be found stunt driving, getting involved in local community service projects, and continuing his focus on staying out of jail.

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the chapter page ( <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London</A> ).

See you there!

Justin Clarke
