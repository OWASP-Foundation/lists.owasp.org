<PRE>This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to be held on Thursday September 9th, at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between 6:00pm-6:30pm).

We're at a new location this time, at Deloitte who have kindly agreed to let us use their facilities:

- Deloitte, 2 New Street Square, London, EC4A 3BZ

Note that we're back to our normal time!

As always, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at <A HREF="http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.">http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.</A> Note, please enter your real name, as this will be given to Deloitte building security. If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close the afternoon of the day before the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">justin.clarke at owasp.org</A> so your space can be released for someone else.

==Talks==

CAT - Michael Jordon
Context Application Tool (CAT) is a tool for performing manual web application penetration testing. The presentation will show the main features of CAT with demonstrations of where CAT can perform tests that other tools currently available cannot and how CAT empowers the user to create more complex test cases to further explore the boundaries of the application. The focus of CAT is on manual penetration testing and not on automated web VA scanning. Also a sneak preview of the current features that are currently in development an due to be release late this year.
Security in the SDLC: IT Doesn't Have To Be Painful! - Matt Bartoldus
Why do organizations fail so miserably at Application Security? Even after investing millions into Information Security programs? Organizations are addressing application security through initiatives from hiring their first 'Security Person' to investing in large time and resource intensive projects. Great! So how come security breaches through applications are still on the rise and showing no signs of abatement? Is the security industry failing? This talk will focus on what the speaker has experienced over the past few years while working with his clients to integrate information security practices into IT processes. This includes large Global Top 100 to medium domestic UK companies. The focus will be around some of the different approaches that were taken and the things that worked and the things that failed miserably. In the end, the audience will be able to take away real world experiences for consideration. The talk will start by discussing some of the more interesting angles the speaker has seen when presenting the business case for a security integration project investment. This includes stepping outside of the traditional security professional arguments and adopting the viewpoint from other parts of an organization. The speaker will then discuss the age old IT consultant's mantra of People, Process and Technology and where security practices fits in. The focus will be on process and people rather than technology. Building upon a business case and the theories around people and processes, we will discuss how to move forward with integrating information security practices into the SDLC. Lastly, we'll talk about the 'gotchas', the pitfalls, traps, and other 'bad things' from perceptions to internal politics. These are discussed in a light-hearted manner through example experiences and 'war stories.' The speaker hopes they will be considered at the beginning of a security initiative or project part of project risk and critical success Factors!
