<PRE>Justin,

I think the results of the study on Enforcement Notices are very interesting
and should be taken for what for what they are: &quot;a study on Enforcement
Notices from the ICO&quot;. What would be good as a next step is to ask the ICO
under the Freedom of Information Act questions around why those issues
raised by you and others in this discussion are such and what if anything
does the Office intend to do about it going forward.

If you or anyone in this group wants to take this up with the ICO, that
would be really great, if not, I'd be happy to do that and feed the response
back to this group. Let me know.

Cheers
Sarb Sembhi

Hacks

Sadly, I think you're probably right.  I also agree with Jim that this is
likely largely an information problem. Firstly, and organisation may not
even be aware that they have had a breach from a web application attack.
Also, in the case that they are aware of a breach they may not be able to
quantify the problem through lack of logged information.  I've only come
across one instance where an organisation we've worked with had a good
record of exactly what data was exposed, and even in that case it was
largely blind luck that they had been logging that information...

In the case that an organisation with my data is aware they've had a breach
that they can't quantify I'd like to see them assume that the information
has been exposed and act accordingly, but do they see it that way?

regards

Justin

SQL Injection attack on UK sourced personal data.

the &quot;too hard&quot; bucket? Or are organisations not even reporting these to the
ICO? I'd think its probably the latter, as many of the SME organisations I'm
aware of wouldn't have a clue as to their responsibilities, and some bigger
organisations aren't much better...

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I found that none of the breaches were the result of a website hack. No
