<PRE> 

We have a FREE ticket for the BruCON Security Conference at the end of next week, kindly donated by John Stock, that we are now auctioning for ChildLine.

 

We are currently raising money for ChildLine (NSPCC) having entered a car in the White Hat Rally, and as an added incentive to get you to part with your money and make a donation to ChildLine through our giving page we will give the BruCON ticket to the individual who donates the highest amount.

 

Full details can be found on our team page at whr2010.co.uk

 

I will be at the Leeds OWASP meeting this evening if you have any questions, and Sharon will be at OWASP in Dublin tomorrow and Friday.

 

Get yourself a bargain, normal retail 195 Euro!

 

Thanks for supporting ChildLine,

 

Martin

 

 

White Hat Rally in support of ChildLine (NSPCC)

 

At the end of September I'm driving in the rally to raise money for ChildLine to help protect vulnerable children. We have pledged to raise &#163;5,000 through personal donations and corporate sponsorship. Please take a moment to visit our team website and learn more about the rally, the charity and how you can help to make a difference to the lives of vulnerable children. ChildLine want to stop cruelty to children.
