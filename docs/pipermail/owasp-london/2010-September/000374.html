Firstly, and organisation may not even be aware that they have had a breach from a web application attack. Also, in the case that they are aware of a breach they may not be able to quantify the problem through lack of logged information.  I've only come across one instance where an organisation we've worked with had a good record of exactly what data was exposed, and even in that case it was largely blind luck that they had been logging that information...

A good few web design/dev houses routinely disable all PHP or perl error logging on production systems.

 From the various code bases we have been asked to review simply enabling error logging is enough
to generate reams of warnings and errors that lead to semi-random result sets, bad logic and
SQL injection points.

And it seems this problem of &quot;released unfit code&quot; is growing. I *strongly* disagree with
error reporting being disabled on a live system as when things invariably go wrong it often helps
track down the problem.

It seems that certain WDH's are using the agile methodology to get code into a
&quot;looks like it works&quot; state and then shipping it thorough a scenario based acceptance test.
SQL injection holes, sem-random results, insane SQL etc are non issues.

This does keep costs down/profis up and the customers sysadmin is happy because there are
no logfiles to keep an eye on :-)
But this nasty &quot;trick&quot; makes my job ( often performance/security/mysql-&gt;pg migration)
absolute hell - its often cheaper to rewrite the app that try and fix the performance/migration
problems. Customers dont like to hear this about their perfect but &quot;slow&quot; business critical web app.
