<PRE>This is an announcement for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to
be held on May 21st (Thursday), at 6:30pm-8:30pm.  Note this is a week later
than usual as the previous week clashes with the OWASP AppSec Europe
conference in Poland.

We're at a new location this time, at Barclays who have kindly agreed to
sponsor the evening:

     Barclays, Presentation Suite 2, One Churchill Place, London E14 5HP

I am in the process of getting details from planned speakers, and should
have these up on the OWASP London page (and sent out in future reminders) in
the near future.

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should
have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well.

If you are planning to attend please RSVP to me (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">justin.clarke at owasp.org</A>),
and I'll make sure you're added to the list of people the Barclays building
security folks are expecting.

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the
chapter page (<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London</A>).

See you there!

Justin Clarke


</PRE>
