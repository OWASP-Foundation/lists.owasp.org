Welcome to the London OWASP list

Since we have a few subscribers now i thought it was time to send out the initial mail.
Ideally i'd like to have the first meeting towards the end of next month (June) and i'm
hoping everyone can start adding
input on what they would like to hear about/where they want it/how much beer etc etc?

maybe for the first meeting we can arrange a venue where we can all enjoy the sun and talk
about forthcoming meetings?


Any suggestions welcome


Daniel

This place is good for an outside drink (on a boat). Nice and central -- just 
down from Aldwych.
