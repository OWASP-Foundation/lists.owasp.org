Subject: [Owasp-london] OWASP table/stand at London Azure event (June 2012)
Message-ID: <CA+f=kXDn2pvzK552r1niR=kBjdfi297u_PwysSRJ=aE8RWKxOw@mail.gmail.com>

A friend of mine is organizing this community-driven event 'Microsoft Cloud
Day: Azure, Window8, Devices and Open Source
innovations<https://www.eventbrite.com/orderconfirmation/3069560137/79940419/?ebtv=C>'
(22nd June) and he is able to get us a space to have an OWASP table/stand.

This would be a great oportunity to reach out to .NET Developers and expose
them to what we are doing at OWASP.

So, anybody here can take the lead on this? or help?

Thanks

Dinis,

By that time we should have some OWASP signage etc to have on a stand. I'm
away in this date (Isle of Wight Festival) but am happy to hand over
signage, handouts etc to volunteers to man a stand, answer questions etc.

Volunteers?

Justin

Subject: [Owasp-london] Announcement - Special Event - Application Security
	One-Day Conference - Free for OWASP/ISSA/CSF Members -
	Thursday, May 10th 2012
Message-ID: <5B031FFE-FF69-4AD3-9056-89EAF040EF24@owasp.org>

ISSA-UK and OWASP London are partnering for the first time to bring you a joint application security training conference, free for members of OWASP, ISSA-UK, or CSF. This unique event will attract attendees from both ISSA-UK's traditional information security membership base, and OWASP's web application specialists, bringing new thoughts and perspectives to both groups. The theme of the day is, no surprise, application security. We expect to focus on both methodologies and frameworks - such as OWASP's top 10 - and a variety of custom tools and frameworks, from open-source to proprietary. The goal is to deliver much needed tips and tricks to attendees, something to tackle our ever increasing workloads. Join us for a full day of application security tricks, tools and methods at the historic Bletchley Park. After the day's talks are over, please join us for a free tour of the famous WWII codebreaking facility!

Location: Bletchley Park, Sherwood Drive, Milton Keynes, MK3 6EB
Time: 10:00am - 4:30pm

11.10       OWASP Mobile Top Ten - Justin Clarke, Consultant (working title)
11.50       Fourth presentation confirmed, details forthcoming
