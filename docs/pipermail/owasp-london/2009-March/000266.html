<PRE>Thank you all for the great turnout, and a good bit of socialisation after
the talks.  A quick note to say that two of the three presentations are now
available on the OWASP London site (<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London</A>),
and I expect that I'll be able to get Bernardo's slide deck uploaded soon as
well.

As discussed in the meeting, I'll be aiming to organise meetings every two
months as we go forward, and that's something that I'd like to solicit a bit
of help with. We are on the lookout for organisations that can host an OWASP
meeting, either in the city or Canary Wharf areas strongly preferred.
Although I'll be approaching many of my contacts in the security industry to
get this arranged, if your company has space that we could use in the
evenings (even once a year) for a meeting of 30-40 people, then that would
be much appreciated.  Think of it as giving a little back, as well as
helping us to build the strong OWASP community that I know we can in London.

More updates as logistics are arranged and firmed up.  Don't forget to get
your friends and colleagues who are interested in OWASP to sign up to the
mailing list so they get updated on meetings. And if you're on LinkedIn -
sign up for the OWASP London group to get updates through that medium as
well.

Best regards

Justin
