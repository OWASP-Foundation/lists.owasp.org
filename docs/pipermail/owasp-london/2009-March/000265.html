Subject: Looking for someone to present to staff

 
 Hello 

I am looking for someone technical with an ability to demonstrate and
present, in layman's terms, to key staff, both technical and non
technical, the threat of hacking sites. I imagine 2 sittings. One in
Bristol and one in London, cc20 people at each.

What for? I would like to reinforce the case for testing during the SDLC
with the help of OWASP tools. What I want to do is show the audience what
can happen today. I believe there is a need to educate those who
commission sites and provide them with the understanding and appreciation
for testing. I thought of approaching the OWASP community but I do not
know who to ask. Maybe you can help?

IOP Publishing are a non profit organisation owned by a charity, the
Institute of Physics Publishing in central London. The Bristol office
provides revenue through publishing to promote physics. At the London
office they also have a conference centre (again, revenue for promoting
physics) which could be of interest. However I cannot make any promises
but will approach if the conference director if space is desirable for an
OWASP gathering. Can you please advise numbers if so. There is a link for
info <A HREF="http://www.76portlandplace.com/">http://www.76portlandplace.com/</A> with a rather flowery video but at
least you do get to see the conference rooms.

With regard to the individual/s reimbursements, expenses can be paid for,
I may also be able to secure something extra for consultancy too. However
if the conference space is of interest perhaps we can do something there.

Thank you for your attention, I hope you can help.


Regards
