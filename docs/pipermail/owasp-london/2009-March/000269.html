Subject: [Owasp-leaders] CFP: MCIS 2009 - Web Application Security Track

The Greek Chapter of OWASP co-organizes a track in the 4th
Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems
(<A HREF="http://www.mcis2009.org">http://www.mcis2009.org</A>) on the topic of Web Application Security.
Below you can find the corresponding call for papers.

Please forward this CFP to your local chapters' mailing lists or to
whoever you think might be interested.

We would also like to place this event under the auspices of OWASP and
also discuss the possiblity of having someone from the global
committee as a guest keynote speaker.

For any additional information reply to this message or contact me directly.

Thanks,

Description
&#139;&#139;&#139;&#173;
The emergence of Web 2.0 technologies brought about the extensive
deployment and use of web-based applications and web services. Such
applications are easy to develop and deploy and demonstrate impressive
features for users, resulting in their current wide use. Nonetheless,
the level of security in web applications doesn&#185;t seem to go along
with their popularity: important security issues have been found and
privacy concerns have also been raised recently. In addition, the
Cloud Computing paradigm promises even greater flexibility; however
corresponding security and privacy issues still need to be examined.
This track aims to bring together application security experts,
researchers, educators and practitioners from the industry, academia
and international communities such as OWASP, in order to discuss open
problems and new solutions in application security. In the context of
this track academic researchers will be able to combine interesting
results with the experience of practitioners and software engineers.

Suggested topics include (but are not limited to):
&#128;       Secure application development
&#128;       Security of service oriented architectures
&#128;       Threat modeling of web applications
&#128;       Cloud computing security
&#128;       Web applications vulnerabilities and analysis
&#128;       Countermeasures for web application vulnerabilities
&#128;       Secure coding techniques
&#128;       Platform or language security features that help secure web
applications
&#128;       Secure database usage in web applications
&#128;       Access control in web applications
&#128;       Web services security
&#128;       Browser security
&#128;       Privacy in web applications
&#128;       Standards, certifications and security evaluation criteria for
web applications
