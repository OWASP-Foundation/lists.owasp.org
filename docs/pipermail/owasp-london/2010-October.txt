Subject: [Owasp-london] Links to the latest O2 Platform installer and O2
	Subscription model
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=JAHGBR1-HKzwJhKLp559JpcYxsN8fHPVeeWQz@mail.gmail.com>

Hi OWASP London

A couple months later, and following the presentation on O2 I did at one of
the last OWASP London Chapter meetings, here is the link the latest O2
Installer<http://o2platform.googlecode.com/svn/O2_ClickOnce_Installers/O2_XRules_Database/setup.exe>(.NET
ClickOnce)  for the ones that want to try the new O2 GUI and
capabilities.

There was also a request for my presentation on the new O2 Business Model,
namely its paid subscriptions.

I just wrote this blog entry about it Update on O2 Subscription
Model<http://diniscruz.blogspot.com/2010/10/update-on-o2-subscription-model.html>and
here is the O2
- Commercial Services
presentation<http://s3.amazonaws.com/O2_MiscFiles/O2++-+Commercial+Services+%28AppSec+DC%29.pdf>(note
that this is an experiment on OWASP where we are trying to figure out
a funding model for OWASP Projects (with O2 leading the way, but more to
follow))

I'm going to be at tonight's London Chapter
meeting<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/London#Friday.2C_October_1st_2010>,
so if you want to talk about O2, just track me down :)

If you have a couple minutes, I really would like to get your feedback on
this O2 Subscription model.

I think that the *'Open Source Tool/API Customization per Subscriber'* model
(where each subscriber gets a targeted version) could actually be a great
funding model not only for OWASP projects but also for other Open Source
projects/APIs (including the many that O2 consumes/exposes).

 =?windows-1252?q?ty_problems_at_the_root=3A_New_IETF_Web_Security_working?=

Message-ID: <4CC1DF87.4030701@gondrom.org>

 Hi dear fellow OWASP London members,

many of the security problems we face derive from weaknesses and
inconsistencies in the operation of the browsers and the HTTP protocol.
And as OWASP, we have been pretty good at mitigating these problems and
working around these deficiencies. But many times I felt like we
actually should try to change the underlying root of the problem rather
then having to live and work within it.

The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) set up a new working group
WEBSEC (http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/websec/charter/) to identify and
tackle these underlying issues and develop standards to solve them
wherever possible. It will also work closely with the W3C Web
Application Security Working Group to get the new changes on the road
and implemented.

These two working groups will provide the unique opportunity to actually
change some of the underlying mechanisms and try to solve some of our
biggest security challenges at the root. But for that to accomplish, it
is important to understand what the problem and what should be done and
what better place then OWASP, with the best Web Application Security
minds, to ask what is good and what should be changed and corrected and
in which way.

So I would like to invite you to provide input for this and join the
WEBSEC working group (note: the IETF is an open organization like OWASP
and all WGs are open for everybody to join freely).
*You can join the group and its mailing-list here:
https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/websec
<https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/websec>*
If you are new to the IETF, there is a small info page Tao of the IETF
(http://www.ietf.org/tao.html)

*So what are your ideas to help mitigate many of the OWASP top ten?*
What are the biggest problems?
What should be done?
What HTTP headers, protocol and policies would you suggest we change or
correct?
Do we need to standardize new headers and certain browser behavior
across the vendors?
How should browsers behave to be safe or how should their behavior
change for use to be able to build more secure web applications?

The time frame for this opportunity of change is within the next few
months, so if you have ideas and suggestions please come forward and we
need to work on them now!

Just as an example of the first items that we discuss are Media Type
Sniffing, Web Origin Concept, integrity of the browser and server, usage
of DNSSEC, Strict Transport Security, X-FRAME-OPTIONS, but there's a lot
more to do and we need your input as OWASP experts!

So if you have ideas, please join the WG and/or get in touch with me.
And please forward this to interested chapters and people!

Kind regards, Tobias
