<PRE>Hello Ben

Would you be releasing this tool under an Open Source Licence (and / or via Owasp)?

Subject: [Owasp-london] Final Year Project Help!! 

Hello,
I have a serious question and would really appreciate your advice.

Currently I am a student at the University of Hertfordshire, on a BSc
Computer Science course. In September I will be entering my final
year project and I am trying to come up with a great idea for a
project/dissertation!!

So at DDD3 I saw the attacking web apps session (done by Dinis) and
thought how cool it was, and how much I wasn't appear of (knew about
buffer overflows, and sql injection etc but still a lot I was not
fully aware of). Very cool session, thank you (if your reading this)

So I thought it would be a great idea to have a tool like what FXCop
for design guidelines is but for the security guidelines focusing on
C# / ASP.net (with bonus/advance/if I have time features being vb.net
and winforms).

The reason for this is because, I feel most developers aren't aware of
the issues or feel that security isn't an issue for there applications
(where I am currently on placement, I get the impression we don't mind
about application security because we have good system security and we
trust our employees - I don't like this idea) so I would love a tool
which could integrate into VS2005 and scan your code for potential
security issues (at compile time), and maybe do runtime checking as
well - meaning developers wouldn't have to be full security gurus to
have more secure code.

Plus it means I get chance to fully read Writing Secure Code (Second
Edition) and other cool security books which I have been wanted to do
for a while

What I would like from you is a bit more information about security
from a high level point of view. Is security in ASP.net 2.0 a big
issue? How secure is it out of the box? More generally how important
is security in the .net world? I know C++ has issues, but I am not
sure about C#.

Finally - do you think the tool would work and be successful? Is
there anything else you could think of?

I would really like your thoughts on this, and some advice on my idea.

Thank you for your time.
