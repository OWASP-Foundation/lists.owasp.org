<PRE>Hi Ben,

RE: tools that integrate with VS2005, source code/runtime checking. Take 
a look at SPIdynamics Webinspect/Devinspect. It's commercial (I am in no 
way affiliated with SPIDynamics), it may give you some ideas.

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> I have a serious question and would really appreciate your advice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently I am a student at the University of Hertfordshire, on a BSc
</I>&gt;<i> Computer Science course.  In September I will be entering my final
</I>&gt;<i> year project and I am trying to come up with a great idea for a
</I>&gt;<i> project/dissertation!!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So at DDD3 I saw the attacking web apps session (done by Dinis) and
</I>&gt;<i> thought how cool it was, and how much I wasn't appear of (knew about
</I>&gt;<i> buffer overflows, and sql injection etc but still a lot I was not
</I>&gt;<i> fully aware of).  Very cool session, thank you (if your reading this)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I thought it would be a great idea to have a tool like what FXCop
</I>&gt;<i> for design guidelines is but for the security guidelines focusing on
</I>&gt;<i> C# / ASP.net (with bonus/advance/if I have time features being vb.net
</I>&gt;<i> and winforms).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The reason for this is because, I feel most developers aren't aware of
</I>&gt;<i> the issues or feel that security isn't an issue for there applications
</I>&gt;<i> (where I am currently on placement, I get the impression we don't mind
</I>&gt;<i> about application security because we have good system security and we
</I>&gt;<i> trust our employees &#8211; I don't like this idea) so I would love a tool
</I>&gt;<i> which could integrate into VS2005 and scan your code for potential
</I>&gt;<i> security issues (at compile time), and maybe do runtime checking as
</I>&gt;<i> well &#8211; meaning developers wouldn't have to be full security gurus to
</I>&gt;<i> have more secure code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Plus it means I get chance to fully read Writing Secure Code (Second
</I>&gt;<i> Edition) and other cool security books which I have been wanted to do
</I>&gt;<i> for a while
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I would like from you is a bit more information about security
</I>&gt;<i> from a high level point of view.  Is security in ASP.net 2.0 a big
</I>&gt;<i> issue? How secure is it out of the box?  More generally how important
</I>&gt;<i> is security in the .net world? I know C++ has issues, but I am not
</I>&gt;<i> sure about C#.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally &#8211; do you think the tool would work and be successful?  Is
</I>&gt;<i> there anything else you could think of?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would really like your thoughts on this, and some advice on my idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your time.
