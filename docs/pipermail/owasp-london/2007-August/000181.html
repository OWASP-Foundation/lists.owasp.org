<PRE>Hello all,
I've just subscribed to OWASP London on a recommendation from a former
colleague. I'm a seasoned IT Professional with circa 20 years experience in
IT Infrastructure as a System Engineer, Pre Sales Solution Architect and
now as an Information Security Professional.
Fair to say I've had a variety of roles and experience.
I recently left IBM Global Services after 10 years and am currently in the
market for a contract / interim role. If anybody has any suggestions of
good resources and specialist recruiters in Information Security I'd be
greatly obliged.
I previously worked for IBM in London some years ago, though more recently
was working for them based in Ireland, hence I'm a bit out of the loop
contact and networking wise ;-)
I hope it's not poor protocol to beg on a first post! though it's as good a
way as any of introducing myself. As mentioned if anyone has any
suggestions / advice please feel free to e-mail me or call on mobile. I
have spent all this week putting out CVs to the recruiters I could find,
though feel sure I haven't caught all of them.

Many thanks and best regards
Howard Scott CISSP, ISO 27001 Lead Auditor, MCSE, MCP, MBCS
