<PRE>Hi all,

Some time ago I offered to help Dinis with the London Chapter
activities and he accepted. I guess that makes me the new
Chapter leader, so here I am. Let's see if I can help to move
things forward.

First of all, I think we need to face our current situation.

I've been attending the Chapter meetings on and off for the
past few years and I've always felt that the turnout is
generally low. I don't think that it's necessary now to try to
determine the reasons why. (But if there are people that are
willing to share their thoughts with us on this subject that
would be most useful.) I think we would be more productive
focusing on improving things. In preparing for this email I
talked to Chapter leaders that have high-attendance figures
(most notably, the Israel Chapter, led by Ofer Shezaf) and
asked for guidance.

Just for reference, some of the other chapters regularly have
attendance numbers near and over the 100 mark. This is what we
should be aiming for.

Here's what I've come up with:

 1 We need an audience. There is certainly no lack of IT and
   security people in London. We need to make them aware that we
   exist and get them to subscribe to our mailing list. We need
   to _interest_ them in what we're doing.

   The easiest way to do this is through word of mouth. For example,
   each member of this list could take upon himself (or herself) to
   recruit two new members.

 2 While meeting at pubs can be fun, it won't attract the kind
   of attendance and sponsorship we need to get things going. We thus
   need to switch from meeting in pubs to meeting at more work-like
   locations. Sponsor-provided locations or Universities come to mind.

   However, we will aim to have the sponsors provide refreshments,
   so not everything will be lost ;)

 3 Talk quality has never been an issue due to the wealth of talent
   available here in London. It would be interesting, however, to
   learn more about the Chapter members and have talks that are aligned
   with their interests.

 4 Bring the most interesting talks from OWASP Conferences, or
   at least brief the Chapter after each main conference.

 5 If any of the above is working, consider turning Chapter meetings
   into proper 1-day conferences. Keep the conferences free.

 6 Hold meetings every 3 or 6 months, depending on the format. If
   we end up having proper 1-day conferences I think we should do
   it once every 6 months.

These are some ideas to get us started. Hopefully they will be
sufficient to provoke some of you to respond and we'll have a
discussion, leading to a consensus.

Our hand is being forced, in a way, with the plan to participate in
the OWASP Day (Dinis already placed our name on the list ;), but I
will send a separate email on that topic. Soon.
