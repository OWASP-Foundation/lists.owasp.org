<PRE>Hi Ivan

I have to say I agree with everything you've said. I've also bcc'd 
several colleagues to this post to encourage them to get involved. A 
good start to your leadership!

cheers
Pete

 &gt;Hi all,
 &gt;
 &gt;Some time ago I offered to help Dinis with the London Chapter
 &gt;activities and he accepted. I guess that makes me the new
 &gt;Chapter leader, so here I am. Let's see if I can help to move
 &gt;things forward.
 &gt;
 &gt;First of all, I think we need to face our current situation.
 &gt;
 &gt;I've been attending the Chapter meetings on and off for the
 &gt;past few years and I've always felt that the turnout is
 &gt;generally low. I don't think that it's necessary now to try to
 &gt;determine the reasons why. (But if there are people that are
 &gt;willing to share their thoughts with us on this subject that
 &gt;would be most useful.) I think we would be more productive
 &gt;focusing on improving things. In preparing for this email I
 &gt;talked to Chapter leaders that have high-attendance figures
 &gt;(most notably, the Israel Chapter, led by Ofer Shezaf) and
 &gt;asked for guidance.
 &gt;
 &gt;Just for reference, some of the other chapters regularly have
 &gt;attendance numbers near and over the 100 mark. This is what we
 &gt;should be aiming for.
 &gt;
 &gt;Here's what I've come up with:
 &gt;
 &gt; 1 We need an audience. There is certainly no lack of IT and
 &gt;   security people in London. We need to make them aware that we
 &gt;   exist and get them to subscribe to our mailing list. We need
 &gt;   to _interest_ them in what we're doing.
 &gt;
 &gt;   The easiest way to do this is through word of mouth. For example,
 &gt;   each member of this list could take upon himself (or herself) to
 &gt;   recruit two new members.
 &gt;
 &gt; 2 While meeting at pubs can be fun, it won't attract the kind
 &gt;   of attendance and sponsorship we need to get things going. We thus
 &gt;   need to switch from meeting in pubs to meeting at more work-like
 &gt;   locations. Sponsor-provided locations or Universities come to mind.
 &gt;
 &gt;   However, we will aim to have the sponsors provide refreshments,
 &gt;   so not everything will be lost ;)
 &gt;
 &gt; 3 Talk quality has never been an issue due to the wealth of talent
 &gt;   available here in London. It would be interesting, however, to
 &gt;   learn more about the Chapter members and have talks that are aligned
 &gt;   with their interests.
 &gt;
 &gt; 4 Bring the most interesting talks from OWASP Conferences, or
 &gt;   at least brief the Chapter after each main conference.
 &gt;
 &gt; 5 If any of the above is working, consider turning Chapter meetings
 &gt;   into proper 1-day conferences. Keep the conferences free.
 &gt;
 &gt; 6 Hold meetings every 3 or 6 months, depending on the format. If
 &gt;   we end up having proper 1-day conferences I think we should do
 &gt;   it once every 6 months.
 &gt;
 &gt;These are some ideas to get us started. Hopefully they will be
 &gt;sufficient to provoke some of you to respond and we'll have a
 &gt;discussion, leading to a consensus.
 &gt;
 &gt;Our hand is being forced, in a way, with the plan to participate in
 &gt;the OWASP Day (Dinis already placed our name on the list ;), but I
 &gt;will send a separate email on that topic. Soon.
 &gt;
