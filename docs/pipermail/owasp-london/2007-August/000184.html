<PRE>The next OWASP London Chapter meeting is going to be held in the
Auriol Kensington Rowing Club on September 5th (Wednesday):

<A HREF="http://www.akrowing.com/page.php?page=findus">http://www.akrowing.com/page.php?page=findus</A>

This is the same place where the meeting was held in March 2006.
(A very nice venue, if I might add.)

Please arrive between 6.30 and 7pm. We shall begin at 7pm.

Now, I am afraid we haven't done a good job organising this
particular meeting. Between Dinis and myself it wasn't clear who
is doing what and I unfortunately let some things to remain
unresolved for too long. This has led to us not yet having the
agenda for the meeting.

I am determined to have the meeting, though, and I will try to
get some interesting speakers. Personally I would like to debate
what could make the chapter come alive again. What is the missing
ingredient?

I will follow up soon with more information.


Thanks,
Ivan
