<PRE>This is a final reminder for the London OWASP chapter meeting tomorrow evening - RSVPs close this afternoon, so make sure you've RSVPd so we can get your name on the door with Expedia building security.

Details are:

Date: Thursday, 24th of October 2013. 6:30pm - 8:30pm
Venue:  Expedia Inc, Angel Building, 407 St John Street, London, EC1V 4EX
Cost: FREE, and open to all

Talks:

Dinis and I are going to reprise two of the talks we both presented at the recent EUTour events:

&#8226; Using the O2 Platform, Zap and AppSensor to protect and test applications - Dinis Cruz

This presentation will show how these 3 OWASP tools can be used to find and mitigate security vulnerabilities in applications. The O2 Platform will be used to analyse the target application source code, and automate the use of both Zap and AppSensor's capabilities.

&#8226; OWASP Mobile Top 10 - Justin Clarke

The OWASP Mobile Security Project is a centralised resource intended to give developers and security teams the resources they need to build and maintain secure mobile applications. Through the project, our goal is to classify mobile security risks and provide developmental controls to reduce their impact or likelihood of exploitation. Justin will be going through the current version of the Mobile Top 10, as well as discussing what is currently happening with the project.

I've setup the Eventbrite page to RSVP here - <A HREF="http://owasp-london.eventbrite.co.uk/.">http://owasp-london.eventbrite.co.uk/.</A> RSVPs will close at 6pm today in order to get the list of names to Expedia security to let you into the building on the day, so if you're going to forward this email to friends and colleagues, please do it now :)

See you all there!

Justin
