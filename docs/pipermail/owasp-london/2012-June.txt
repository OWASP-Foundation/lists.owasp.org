Ken,

I when back through my archive and I also found the slides that I
delivered at the Australian NSW State Government on PCI DSS v1.1 and
had also commenced the update of the slides to PA-DSS v1.2 up to
Section 7.

Let me know if these are of interest and if you would be interested in
contributing to update these to v1.2?

Hello Mohinder,

Thank you for your observation. This event is not my event - so I don't
control that link. I sent it to the list because it will have Jim Manico
speaking, who sits on the board of OWASP and thus I made the assumption it
would be also of interest to people participating in OWASP; and forwarded
it to the list.

I have had the opportunity to see both speakers, and I highly recommend
both. They each our outstanding contributors to information security, and
brilliant speakers to boot! The OODA talk, which I have not yet seen, is
bound to be one of the most cutting edge ideas is secure development to be
proposed in for several years to come.

Dennis

David,
?
Thanks for the update. Your earlier message indicated the venue as BCS London Offices, 5 Southampton St. I checked the BCS calendar and found no?entry for this event for 11 June.?I am secretary to BCS SPA and I am not aware of this event. Do you know who made the booking? Evenbrite calendar?shows 43 places available and if more people are attending then we may request two adjoining rooms.

With kind regards,


Mohinder Khosla, PhD

Some folks from asked me to step away from giving a talk in London. They
felt I was muscling in on ISC^2 territory.

Gents, my intention is to give a vendor-neutral talk on web app secure
coding.

I'm happy to or not to give a talk, the last thing I want to do is piss
anyone off.

Ken,

I when back through my archive and I also found the slides that I
delivered at the Australian NSW State Government on PCI DSS v1.1 and
had also commenced the update of the slides to PA-DSS v1.2 up to
Section 7.

Let me know if these are of interest and if you would be interested in
contributing to update these to v1.2?

David,
?SPA committee would be inclined to discuss alignment with other specialists group outside BCS that have similar interests in Software Practice Advancement. Anything outside this remit would be hard sell to wider SPA?members. They would be willing to hold joint events if that benefits?members of both groups.? Let's keep our options and see where we go from here.
?
I had one response so far in support of 11 June event at BCS. Some of our committee members may be away for the long weekend and did not had a chance to access their messages. I hope that they will respond?when they return to their desks. Keep you posted.?
With kind regards,


Mohinder Khosla, PhD

Dennis,

Jim is the Chair of
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Connections_Committee#Committee_Membersand
further information is listed at
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Jmanico

That stated, he was nominated for the OWASP Board but decided to pull out
before the election to focus on the Connections Committee.  I hope that he
stands as a candidate for the next OWASP Board election since he shares our
concern and has identified several issues related to governance (of lack
thereof) of the OWASP Board e.g.
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-board/2012-March/010800.html,

Jim,

I can not see any concerns on "muscling in on ISC2 territory", speaking 
as OWASP and ISC2 member, though of course I am not an ISC2 official. In 
my view actually OWASP and ISC2 have worked well together in the past 
and in fact complement each other very very nicely.

If you receive such kind of feedback from ISC2, please write to me in 
private and I will try to check back with the people about their 
concerns, acting in my roles as one of the London OWASP chapter board 
guys and part of the OWASP GIC.

Aloha and a warm welcome to London,

Tobias

Some folks from asked me to step away from giving a talk in London. They
felt I was muscling in on ISC^2 territory.

Gents, my intention is to give a vendor-neutral talk on web app secure
coding.

I'm happy to or not to give a talk, the last thing I want to do is piss
anyone off.

Jim,

I can not see any concerns on "muscling in on ISC2 territory", speaking 
as OWASP and ISC2 member, though of course I am not an ISC2 official. In 
my view actually OWASP and ISC2 have worked well together in the past 
and in fact complement each other very very nicely.

If you receive such kind of feedback from ISC2, please write to me in 
private and I will try to check back with the people about their 
concerns, acting in my roles as one of the London OWASP chapter board 
guys and part of the OWASP GIC.

Aloha and a warm welcome to London,

Tobias

Hello Folks,

Due to the public holiday, and my being behind at work - I have not had
time to properly advertise this event.  My apologies to the speakers
who volunteered; I don't want you to come and speak and have nobody turn
up! I was hoping to reschedule for the 21rst of June but I am unable to get
in touch with anybody at the University.
I look forward to seeing you all on July 5th, 2012!

Thank you,

Dennis

Tobias,

The relationship dissolved in 2008 due to ISC2 presentation at OWASP
AppSec Conference in New York during 2008 i.e.
http://www.veracode.com/blog/2008/09/isc2s-newest-cash-cow-csslp/

This relationship could be restored if OWASP allowed cross posting of
the ISC2 London Chapter Meeting on the various OWASP UK Chapter
Meetings Mailing List and vice versa.

Jim could also presented at the ISC2 Chapter Event on the OWASP bodies
of work which may be cited by CSSLP (I have no knowledge of the CSSLP
courseware as I don't hold the CSSLP).

Christian,

thanks for the explanation.
As member of the OWASP Global Industry Committee, I'll look into our 
liaison with ISC2.

But whether an individual OWASP chapter (e.g. UK/London) would want to 
forward some ISC2 invitations, is in my view totally up to whether the 
content matches our OWASP policies for cross posting (i.e. no promotions 
and is relevant for OWASP members) and at the discretion of the chapter 
lead.

I also hold a CSSLP, but never got any invitations to ISC2 chapter 
events in London. (though some conference from time to time). And last 
but not least, to my knowledge CSSLP does refer to OWASP Top-10 in the 
CBK. ;-)

Cheers, Tobias

 The (ISC)2 London chapter doesn't exist yet. It has never met. That would explain why you have never been invited. we are in the process of forming and petitioning for formal recognition. 

Any (ISC)2 members who are on this list, but aren't getting info on the formation of the London chapter through other means can either join the (ISC)2 London Chapter group on LinkedIn or contact me off-list. 

Cheers,
Paco

Paco,

When Fred Piper supported me in starting the OWASP-RHUL chapter, it was
supposed to have been a join chapter of the (ISC)2 and OWASP. I hope that
you will help me make that a reality.

I have added you to the OWASP-RHUL list. You may post here at this chapter
as you see fit.  I do not speak for Royal Holloway, nor all of OWASP, but
Royal Holloway certainly embraces the (ISC)2; and as an alumni of the ISG,
so do I. Similarly, at my chapter of OWASP-RHUL you and the (ISC)2 are
always welcome.

When it comes to security education I do believe we all have something to
contribute to the problem. I personally would welcome the opportunity to
have you  and members of the (ISC)2 speak to the students at the OWASP-RHUL
chapter, and we would most definitely welcome the participation of (ISC)2
and its associates here.

Cheers,

[UK list cross-post - sorry if I missed any chapter out]

The Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has opened a
consultation on the proposed security requirements for smart meter
systems, due to be rolled out from 2014 to 2019. The consultation is
at:

  http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/consultation/smart-meters-security-risk-assess/5434-cons-smart-meters-security-risk-assess.pdf

It mentions "good practices", "ISO 27001" and includes a definition of
"secure". It asks three open questions:

* Do you consider that the draft licence conditions deliver the policy
intention outlined in this document? Please provide comments on where
the drafting could be amended or clarified.

* Do you have any comments on the proposed approach that suppliers
should carry out a number of good practice security disciplines and
procedures as is set out in this document?

* Do you have any further comments with regard to the issues raised in
this document? We also welcome general comments around the approach to
small suppliers, the processes expected of suppliers in general, and
any related costs.

Maybe OWASP's UK chapters would like to collaboratively submit a
response? I am happy to coordinate. If anyone is interested please
contact me directly or via these lists. The consultation closes on
27th July.

Hi Colin,

thank you for bringing this up.
I think you are right and it would make sense for OWASP to submit a 
response.
Thanks for taking the coordination lead on this.
I'll be happy to join and help with the response.

Best regards, Tobias

Ps.: some things coming to my mind immediately, would be:
1. for the the security of applications to read and manage the meters, 
OWASP could provide great to input
2. and from what I know about smart metering, it might also be important 
to talk about risks from the perspective of all main stakeholders:
- risks to the provider
- risks to the public (critical infrastructure/availability of 
assets/power)
- and risks to the customer (exposure of customer data, btw. I saw a

TV (seriously, the power consumption pattern could be correlated to 
specific channels)).
