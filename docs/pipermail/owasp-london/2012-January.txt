I have been approached for consulting role in London without being
required to be qualified under CHECK i.e. I can't obtain a UK Security
Clearance as I hold Australian Citizenship.

Can anyone provide me with the average rate for the UK job market?

Some people have asked me directly for more information so:

It is a permanent leadership position i.e. Principal/Practice Leader.

The values I have been provided so far ?50K to ?70K, in which case
this would be similar to when I was last in the UK on holiday i.e.
July 2010.

However, salaries for particular roles within Australia have decreased
by 25% since July 2010.

http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/london-security-salary-SRCH_IL.0,6_IM1035_KE7,15.htm
returned no results/salaries since I assume that it scraps this from
job adverts which don't list their salary.

Hi

 I guess most of you know or heard about the ICT curriculum issues e.g.

  'Dull' computer classes beefed up **
  The education secretary has announced a replacement for "harmful and
 dull" ICT classes in England's schools, which he says will better
equip pupils for the 21st Century.
  < http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-16493929 >

 Does anyone have time to pass on some thoughts to the relevant
authorities on building security into the school curriculum?  Hands up
please...

 Maybe we could engage with some other organisations about this such
as  GetSafeOnline and SSDRI?

The question is not Dull or Smart, it is about making IT creative.

There is probably a need for a short section on personal IT security,
probably the equivalent for safe sex in biology.   Trying to teach kids
about industrial strength security  would fall in to the Dull catagory.   

Presenting security as a "who-dunnit" story might make it more attractive
and their spark imagination.  Relate it to what they see in the media -
Lizbeth Salander or Spooks.

We have to give security the same "cool" as writing video games 

So as we start to think about who engage to support these initiatives,
remember Marsh McLuhan, the medium is the message.

Richard

The offensive security course does a good job for it's scope. Why not use that as a template format for security courses/training.

Thanks for all the great ideas.  I wonder if we could put together a
short letter, with say three key appsec recommendations, and send it
to the minister?

Would anyone be willing to front this?

Hi folks,

All of the 60 places initially allocated for this event have been taken!
We've been able to make another 10 places available, but those are going
fast too.
So if you want to come alone then please book asap

And if you have booked but now cant make it then please let me know and
I'll release your ticket so someone else can use it.

And finally, a couple of people have suggested videoing the event - any
volunteers??

Cheers,

Simon

I'm happy to put some effort in, and I can put a face on it if need be.

To inspire secure software I think we need to inspire thoroughly correct software. When software does exactly what it says on the tin, with no unexpected behaviours, it also happens to be secure. Developers don't write software that doesn't do stuff. They write software that does stuff. They must be told how to do the job well.

If I had to pick 3 points, one of them would be from the test-driven development camp. Basically provoking every developer who says her software/module/function does X to provide some reason (e.g., a unit test, integration test, etc.) for believing it. In this high tech world, we are entirely too prone to believe things work, without applying a healthy filter of skepticism. Children are brought up amongst technology that looks like magic to OAPs. They see it work over and over and don't develop the skepticism that they should. They should be taught that software fails, hardware fails, and people make mistakes. Testing while developing is vital for catching problems before they grow into larger issues. I will bet that many learning computer science today struggle to write a clear test case that tests exactly what they need to test, and nothing else.

My ?0.02,
Paco

Thanks for all the great ideas.  I wonder if we could put together a
short letter, with say three key appsec recommendations, and send it
to the minister?

Would anyone be willing to front this?

Presenting security as a "who-dunnit" story might make it more attractive
and their spark imagination.  Relate it to what they see in the media -
Lizbeth Salander or Spooks.

We have to give security the same "cool" as writing video games

So as we start to think about who engage to support these initiatives,
remember Marsh McLuhan, the medium is the message.

Hi

I guess most of you know or heard about the ICT curriculum issues e.g.

 'Dull' computer classes beefed up **
 The education secretary has announced a replacement for "harmful and
dull" ICT classes in England's schools, which he says will better equip
pupils for the 21st Century.
 < http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-16493929 >

Does anyone have time to pass on some thoughts to the relevant authorities
on building security into the school curriculum?  Hands up please...

Maybe we could engage with some other organisations about this such as
GetSafeOnline and SSDRI?

I really like Paco's choice of TDD; I'll nominate a second point:
"The art of input validation" ?

Please personally let me know if you can and would like to participate 
in this spontaneous get together with Sara Baso & Dinis Cruz at Royal 
Holloway.

I know it is very short notice (it was a last minute impromptu meeting), 
and for this reason I require it would be beneficial to understand if 
turnout is sufficient to hold the meeting.



Thank you,

The hours of the event are between 18:30 - 20:30. After that people 
often make their way to a pub and discussions have gone on until well 
into the evening?

Come for an hour, come for the evening - we would love to have you!

I think Richard is on the right tracks with including something being aimed at internet usage, rather than appsec specifically. How about "Staying Safe on the Web" including guidance on understanding privacy, why it matters, how to use Social Media sites in a safe way?

Colin,

I think we could tie your Top 3 recommendations with efforts like Rewired
State in the UK:

http://rewiredstate.org/

Basically, trying to raise the bar about appsec reaching out to students,
non-profit orgs (RS), and professionals.

In my opinion, we shouldn't go too deep technically (eg. prevent sql
injection) but rather provide high-level recommendations.

Happy to contribute and provide feedback.

Fabio

Long time listener, first time caller. Sadly I find TDD and security engineering almost culturally at odds with each other. 

Tests are written to ensure correctness, in relation to the correct cases that you can think of. Tests fall from the user stories or requirements (however expressed), like "we must send the users email. We must capture a users email address" the almost wholesale problem with that is that very rarely is there a user story which expresses the security aspect in user stories, because users dont express them. They don't think like that. This is further compounded by the fact that TDD is about tests to make sure software does what you want it to do, not what you don't. In reality we want the developer to have a typically defensive stance when writing code,  TDD doesn't do that. 

Sorry Paco, I'm not saying this just because it's you :)

Having just done a recent round of graduate recruitment I was surprised at the quality of candidates. For those who've been formerly taught things, and paid good money to do so, I very much doubt that at a level they would be able to effectively manage security concerns along with just being able to write enough code to solve the problem. I think a general ethos of interacting and writing secure code is important it needs recurrent reenforcement.  

As you say some computer scientists seem to have difficulty in describing OO concepts like polymorphism and encapsulation, and linked lists from arrays and don't even know what a hash based data structure is.  After highlighting they've been taught it! If you are overloaded (hehe) by that then I question the value of teaching testing.

You are right about testings importance but TDD in my experience doesn't lend itself to these kinds of tests.  From ethos perspective I think you're correct though

Basically provoking every developer who says her software/module/function does X to provide some reason (e.g., a unit test, integration test, etc.) for believing it. In this high tech world, we are entirely too prone to believe things work, without applying a healthy filter of skepticism. Children are brought up amongst technology that looks like magic to OAPs. They see it work over and over and don't develop the skepticism that they should. They should be taught that software fails, hardware fails, and people make mistakes. Testing while developing is vital for catching problems before they grow into larger issues. I will bet that many learning computer science today struggle to write a clear test case that tests exactly what they need to test, and nothing else.

Hi Max! Glad to pique your interest. :)

I changed the subject hoping that others would forgive the tangent off
into testing land.

In the world of testing, there are two kinds of activities: checking and
testing. There are substantial differences between the two activities.
>From the outside the two are often incorrectly confused with each other.

"Checking" is exactly what you describe. Does the software do what it is
supposed to do? This activity can be (and sometimes is) done by
mouth-breathing mouse clickers. That sort of activity is often done by
humans for the sake of expediency, but could be done perfectly well by
computers if we had the right framework / harness / programmers, etc.

"Testing" on the other hand is more exploratory. That does not mean ad
hoc, unplanned, random, or unpredictable. But it means interacting with
the software outside its normal parameters. Michael Bolton (no, not the
no-talent ass-clown[1]) has a good blog about this:
http://www.developsense.com/blog/2009/08/testing-vs-checking/

Because so many organisations put so little funding or effort into their
quality assurance / testing / whatever phases, most developers experience
testing as a pretty pathetic bunch of losers performing rote checks
against an app. They have no hope of turning up an interesting issue, and
when they do, they're unable to explain it. That has nothing to do with
the discipline of software quality as a whole. To look at the crappy PHP
being flung all over the web and use it to make statements about software
development generally would be a similar misunderstanding.

So I agree test-driven development is low value if the only thing the
development-written checks do is check correct behaviour. They must test
negative conditions, too. That's not a failure of theory, it's a failure
of practice. As we know: In theory, theory and practice are the same. In
practice, they're not.

Cheers,
Paco

I agree that TDD doesnt usually address security, mostly because many
(most?) developers dont understand security (and I'm a developer;).

But how about if you use those tests to drive the security tools?
Thats what I'm introducing where I work.
Developers write UI tests using tools like Selenium.
Then we proxy Selenium through ZAP, run the Selenium tests then run the ZAP
spider, passive and active scanners.
Using the tests in this way means you should get better coverage and drive
the application in a more realistic way.
And developers dont have to know about all the different attack vectors.
A simple example is here: https://code.google.com/p/bodgeit/wiki/RegTests
No automated scanner will find all security vulnerabilities, but the above
setup will hopefully catch silly mistakes within hours of the code being
committed, so the pentesters can concentrate on the more interesting
problems.

Thats my theory anyway :)

This is interesting because I have never seen a security test of any 
value that didn't also ensure correctness, in fact 'correct behaviour' 
is a prerequisite to understanding failure!

> compounded by the

Funny isn't it! They do the 'correctness testing' but they fail to write 
the rest of the quality checks - why is that do you suppose? Could it be 
that it is because they think it is 'the securities people's job'?

When a user logs in and types their password is that a security test or 
a functional test? What about password resets? What about account 
lockout - most of those are functional requirements in most 
applications?

But it very, very easily could - take a very close look at the OWASP O2 
project; it even has cucumber built in so you can write gherkin security 
tests? The fact is the next generation of testers are going to have to 
provide security and functionality testing.

> Sorry Paco, I'm not saying this just because it's you :)

The point is that maybe TDD is being done wrong; not that TDD is wrong. 
Agile was intended to free people from dogma - but it has instead become 
a dogma of its own! People are doing the actions of agile, but they are 
not at all agile - you are not alone in your observation of this. 
However, that doesn't make agile broken; rather it says a great deal 
more about the people practising it.

Hi Max
This is another first time caller, and I want to put in my tuppence worth
as I feel that TDD is misunderstood in this context. Its goal isn?t to
ensure correctness but to conquer complexity, driving out simple design and
supple, maintainable code. This task is orthogonal to gathering and
managing technical requirements, which is where I see the security
engineering under focus.
I believe TDD is a tool used in implementation process, whilst tools like
threat modelling and attack surface analysis are used in the design
process, and fuzz testing in the QA process. This is not to say that these
processes should be executed at different points in time or by different

I think that if you want to inspire a new generation into AppSec we
should teach them how to hack & exploit vulnerabilities.

Hacking is fun, eye/mind opening and will allow for (eventually) the
right question been asked: 'ok, so how do I fix it (or don't create it
in he first place)'

Simon's concept below is pure gold.

Most UnitTests and TDD environments contain most of what is needed to
successfully test an app for security.

What we need is find good ways to add Security (& abuse cases) to
functional tests

I agree that TDD doesnt usually address security, mostly because many
(most?) developers dont understand security (and I'm a developer;).

But how about if you use those tests to drive the security tools?
Thats what I'm introducing where I work.
Developers write UI tests using tools like Selenium.
Then we proxy Selenium through ZAP, run the Selenium tests then run the ZAP
spider, passive and active scanners.
Using the tests in this way means you should get better coverage and drive
the application in a more realistic way.
And developers dont have to know about all the different attack vectors.
A simple example is here: https://code.google.com/p/bodgeit/wiki/RegTests
No automated scanner will find all security vulnerabilities, but the above
setup will hopefully catch silly mistakes within hours of the code being
committed, so the pentesters can concentrate on the more interesting
problems.

Thats my theory anyway :)
