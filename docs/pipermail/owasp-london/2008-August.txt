Subject: [Owasp-london] Our next meeting will be on Canary Wharf on
	September 4th
Message-ID: <48B92B01.8020806@webkreator.com>

Hi everyone,

This is a reminder that our next meeting will be held at Canary Wharf, 
sponsored  by KPMG. Monday mid-day is the cut-off date at which I need 
to provide them with the list of attendees. If you are planning to 
attend please send me an email by Monday noon at the latest.

Refreshments will be provided.

We will have two talks on the night.

1 James Fisher: DirBuster & Beyond

   An introduction to the DirBuster project, detailing how it works, what
   it can do for you, and the direction it will be taking in the future.
   Followed by an introduction to my unreleased project FuzzBuster,
   showing why it's different to other HTTP fuzzes out there.

   DirBuster is a popular OWASP project:

2 Ivan Ristic: Enough with Default Allow in Web Applications!

   A discussion about negative and positive security models in web
   applications and web application firewalls, and what, if anything,
   we can do to promote positive security models among developers.

   This talk will be based on the recently released whitepaper of the
   same name, and ModProfiler, a tool that generates positive security
   models for ModSecurity out of recorded application traffic. Both
   are available for download here:

   I gave this talk at Black Hat US in August.
