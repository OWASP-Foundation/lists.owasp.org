Subject: [Owasp-london] Reminder - Next Central London OWASP meeting next
	week, Thursday the 8th of November,
	at Morgan Stanley in Canary Wharf
Message-ID: <84A0DB6B-5F96-4BCB-BEE2-86CDD48F6DCB@owasp.org>

This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP Central London chapter meeting to be held next week on Thursday November 8th, at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between 6:00pm-6:30pm).  This meeting we have a special treat in the form of well known security researcher and practioner Petko D. Petkov (pdp) talking.

We're back at Morgan Stanley who have kindly agreed to let us use their facilities:

- Morgan Stanley, 25 Cabot Square, Canary Wharf, London E14 4QA

Note - this is the same building as we were in earlier in the year, this is NOT the building next to the Heron Quays DLR station. Make sure you have a look on Google Maps or similar to make sure you're heading to the right building!

As always, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

Even though this meeting is free and open to all, if you are planning to attend you must RSVP athttp://owasp-london.eventbrite.com. Please enter your real name, as this will be given to Morgan Stanley building security. If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close at midday the day before the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at justin.clarke at owasp.org so your space can be released for someone else.

==Talks==

	? A Short History of The JavaScript Security Arsenal - Petko D. Petkov
In 2006 we had the first JavaScript port scanner. The same year we saw the incarnation of more advanced tools such as AttackAPI, Carnaval and Backframe. A year later we saw several decent attempts to create complete security tools designed to run with nothing else but web technologies. That was just the start.
This presentation aims to show the progress that has been made in the past six years in terms of security tools developed entirely with the help of browser technologies. The presentation will take you on a journey through the years, exploring some of the interesting attack techniques used in the past, bringing back some of the important discussions and eventually reaching the culmination when modern tools and technologies will be shown and explained.

	? The continuously evolving threat landscape call CISOs to consider new application security measures, how OWASP can help? - Marco Morana
The aim of this 20 minute talk is how to introduce Chief Information Security Officers (CISO) to the OWASP Application Security Guide. OWASP has developed a guidance to specifically to address the needs of CISOs to help them in prioritizing the risk mitigation of web application vulnerabilities might severely and negatively impact the organization and jeopardizing the business.

I will also give a short update on what's been going on in the OWASP world since our last meeting, if we have time remaining.

==Speakers==

	? Petko D. Petkov

He is a recognised information security researcher, security tools developer, penetration tester, frequent speaker at industry events, and published author who has contributed to several best-selling books, numerous popular blogs and online magazines. pdp?s current endeavour is an ambitious project called Websecurify ? a unique web application security testing toolkit designed with simplicity in mind. In his own words: "Websecurify is revolutionising the way we use web application security testing tools, opening a whole new world of possibilities".

	? Marco Morana

Subject: [Owasp-london] .UK domain name "security"
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBnVb+HTdVUj9r+TB3NX0UJHyH+oeMXeJCvv4Z+ODJPfTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Nominet is requesting responses to a consultation on proposals for new
second-level .uk domains. Regardless of the merits of that idea, I
wondered if UK OWASPers wanted to submit a response to the security
ideas proposed? Apart from registrant identity verification, the
security ideas are currently:

* routine monitoring of domains for malware and viruses on the domain name
* include a visible trust mark4 to indicate this enhanced security to
customers of the domain,
* include mandatory DNSSEC signing

It would seem OWASP ought to be able to suggest improvements to this
list. The consultation document is:

   http://www.nominet.org.uk/sites/default/files/Nominet_FINAL_electronic_form3_0.pdf

The closing date for responses is 7th January 2013. The response does
not need to be long. Does anyone have time to:

a) make suggestions
b) collect ideas from others in the chapter
c) help draft the response
d) approach other UK chapter to do b) and c)
e) help create a single submission

You can of course reply to the consultation independently as well.

Colin

Colin,

Since OWASP has a poor track record related to DNS Security I would
recommend that you pursue this independently i.e.

I think much of it is sensible, with a few exceptions:

 *   I don't think a "trust mark" is a good idea. The kinds of stuff they propose to trust and verify are pretty minimal. That is, http://sony.uk/ could still spew out tens of millions of accounts, despite all the dnssec and verification. I applaud the use of DNSSEC, but I think putting a visible badge out there will mislead people.
 *   The proposal implicitly connects things like malware with a specific domain and thus the presence of malware with the domain owner's responsibility. I don't think it works like that in the real world. With cloud, shared hosting, and so on, it is possible for malware to originate from a host that happens to service my domain, but it didn't get there through a vulnerability in software I control. If I use a sloppy shared hosting provider and crap on another user's app lets a hacker in, I could find my domain spewing out malware, and then my domain is suspended while it's my problem to prove there's no more malware.

I suppose the false positive problem is addressed by the grace period. The problem with that is that any grace period long enough to be fair in a business context (e.g., 7 days before shutting down a domain) is useless in fighting malware. Malware does much more damage when it first appears, before other services catch it and respond. If a system has been part of the command and control of a botnet for 7 days while the domain owner sorts it out, it has served its purpose. Shorter grace periods, though (like 48 hours) are too quick. They create the possibility that someone's web site is taken offline before they've processed the notice and figured out what to do.

Lastly, the idea that AXFR (which is trivial and meaningless by itself anyways) was allowed on owasp.org two years ago is completely irrelevant. There is no value in dredging that up. It was irrelevant 2 years ago, and it is irrelevant now.

Paco,

Acting on behalf of OWASP,  Aspect Security's "spin" of this was largely
misunderstood by the greater security community even after I became
somewhat involved i.e.
https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2010-April/002985.html

If a vendor has a commercial vested in responding to Nominet then they
would be resort to attacking OWASP's perceived lack of "creditability" on
this subject, even if these attacks are later determined to be unfounded.

My recommendation would be to remove the direct association of OWASP to the
response to Nominet.

OWASP is a professional organisation and is entitled to offer comments. The original question was "do we want to", not "is the organisation credible." If you'd rather your comments be supplied without being associated with OWASP, that's OK. It's an open comment period.
