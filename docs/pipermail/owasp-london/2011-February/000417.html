<PRE>
We have a very large website which processes payment card details (hence falls under PCI) and are getting a push from our compliance teams to run rescans every time we make a code change.

I agree with the others that this is beyond what's called for to be compliant, but it's it shouldn't be infeasible.

This is very infeasible as a full set of scans takes weeks to run and the bulk of our code changes are very unlikely to cause vulnerabilities.

I'm surprised it takes weeks. That sounds more like broken process than anything else. For most applications, even the really big ones, you can get to a state where rescans are not so onerous. I've done dozens of apps including plenty of multi-million line systems and even if the first scan (for a baseline) takes a couple weeks on-site, we get subsequent scans down to something far less.

In all the commercial code scanners, it's possible to build up filters and custom rule sets that speed up your scans and optimise it for what what's relevant, while at the same time performing incremental scans of just the code that has changed (as opposed to rescanning the entire app from start to finish every time). Rather than build up an extra process around scanning, I'd just look to optimise the process you have and try to get the tools to produce a more reasonable output in a more reasonable time. Combine that optimisation with a middle ground compromise with the compliance people. Rescan for each major release? Each minor release? There ought to be some milestone with enough frequency to keep them happy without driving you nuts.

Regards,
Paco
