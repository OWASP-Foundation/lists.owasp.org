<PRE>Mandy,

&gt;<i> We have a very large website which processes payment card details (hence falls under PCI) and are getting a push from our compliance teams to run rescans every time we make a code change.
</I>
Are they aware that this would exceed what is required to maintain
conformance to PCI DSS i.e.
<A HREF="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/infosupp_6_6_applicationfirewalls_codereviews.pdf">https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/infosupp_6_6_applicationfirewalls_codereviews.pdf</A>

&gt;<i> This is very infeasible as a full set of scans takes weeks to run and the bulk of our code changes are very unlikely to cause vulnerabilities.
</I>
A SaaS/cloud offering might be suitable then, such as
<A HREF="http://www.veracode.com/">http://www.veracode.com/</A> or
<A HREF="https://www.fortify.com/products/fortify-on-demand/index.html">https://www.fortify.com/products/fortify-on-demand/index.html</A>

Since PCI DSS references the OWASP Top Ten then
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Quote-Veracode_Provides_Visibility_into_Their_Verification_Process_for_the_OWASP_Top_10">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Quote-Veracode_Provides_Visibility_into_Their_Verification_Process_for_the_OWASP_Top_10</A>
might be your preferred solution.

Justin Clarke could also assist with Fortify - I highly recommend GDS.

Furthermore, I would recommend selecting a different SAST/DAST vendor
each time for coverage.

&gt;<i> I am trying to come up with some sensible guidance around when a scan is needed on our Java code. My first suggestions is as follows:-
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Convert the list of classes / packages listed in the Java/J2EE section of <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_Table_of_Contents">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_Table_of_Contents</A> into a set of PMD / FindBugs rules. This would be run against the modified code to see if it generates any &quot;warnings&quot;.
</I>
I would recommend integrating PMD, FindBugs, etc as part of your
automated build process anyway prior to submitting it to an external
review to reduce the cost of remediation.

Also, as a majority of the OWASP Top Ten is related Input (and Output)
Validation then refactoring (similar to a major release) of these Java
classes might require an external review and therefore might meet the
requirements of the mandate specified by your compliance team.

&gt;<i> I had a quick google to see if anyone had done this before and couldn't find anything so am asking whether..
</I>
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Secure-Programming-Static-Analysis-Brian/dp/0321424778">http://www.amazon.com/Secure-Programming-Static-Analysis-Brian/dp/0321424778</A>
is a reasonable reference.

&gt;<i> b) are there any other alternatives? OWASP Orizon sounds great but can't seem to find some documentation to explain it in detail / try it out..
</I>
