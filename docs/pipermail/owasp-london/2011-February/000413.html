<PRE>Another something different - in conjunction with London Geek Nights.

As part of OWASP working with developer focused groups, and making sure we cross-pollinate with some of the other interesting and cool groups in London, I've arranged an evening on SSL as a general topic with the folks from Geek Nights.  This is our chance to have some real discussions about the practical usages of SSL with folks who're developing and running real applications, and grab a few beers after with a few new folks.

Due to this being run in conjunction, signup will be on London Geek Nights site - <A HREF="http://londongeeknights.wetpaint.com/page/Securing+the+Web+with+SSL">http://londongeeknights.wetpaint.com/page/Securing+the+Web+with+SSL</A> 

See you all there!

Justin
