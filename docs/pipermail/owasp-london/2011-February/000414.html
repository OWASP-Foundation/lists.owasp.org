<PRE>Apologies if this isn't the right forum for this discussion but I'm hoping this group can help..

We have a very large website which processes payment card details (hence falls under PCI) and are getting a push from our compliance teams to run rescans every time we make a code change.

This is very infeasible as a full set of scans takes weeks to run and the bulk of our code changes are very unlikely to cause vulnerabilities.

I am trying to come up with some sensible guidance around when a scan is needed on our Java code. My first suggestions is as follows:-

- Convert the list of classes / packages listed in the Java/J2EE section of <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_Table_of_Contents">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_Table_of_Contents</A> into a set of PMD / FindBugs rules. This would be run against the modified code to see if it generates any &quot;warnings&quot;.

I had a quick google to see if anyone had done this before and couldn't find anything so am asking whether..

a) this sounds like a good plan (and if so I could donate it to OWASP for others to use)

b) are there any other alternatives? OWASP Orizon sounds great but can't seem to find some documentation to explain it in detail / try it out..

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide

Mandy
