<PRE>Hi Mandy,

Couple of notes :-

We've had a client go the PMD route and had us write rules to
implement their secure coding guidelines, so that approach is doable.
Depending on your development process, I'd look to implement
guidelines rather than the code review guide as a practical step
(otherwise may be more than can be done practically). As you noted,
Fortify (now HP) is an option to make this easier - I'd also look at
IBM (Rational AppScan Source Edition) and Veracode as well to have a
look at the main options, if you're going down the commercial route.

The other note is that we had a lot of discussion at the OWASP Summit
last week about OWASP being more useful to developers and business in
general. Although this is certainly a complex and multifaceted
question all on it's own, I'd be interested in how we can be more
useful to folks like yourself, and to non-banking organisations like
BA. For example - what could OWASP provide that would justify BA
joining up as a corporate member? Perhaps if you have any ideas and
frustrations that would be something that fit in the OWASP sphere, let
me know and I'll set up a call to capture these and feed back into the
post Summit feedback?

best regards

Justin

</I>&gt;<i> We have a very large website which processes payment card details (hence falls under PCI) and are getting a push from our compliance teams to run rescans every time we make a code change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is very infeasible as a full set of scans takes weeks to run and the bulk of our code changes are very unlikely to cause vulnerabilities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am trying to come up with some sensible guidance around when a scan is needed on our Java code. My first suggestions is as follows:-
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Convert the list of classes / packages listed in the Java/J2EE section of <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_Table_of_Contents">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_Table_of_Contents</A> into a set of PMD / FindBugs rules. This would be run against the modified code to see if it generates any &quot;warnings&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had a quick google to see if anyone had done this before and couldn't find anything so am asking whether..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) this sounds like a good plan (and if so I could donate it to OWASP for others to use)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b) are there any other alternatives? OWASP Orizon sounds great but can't seem to find some documentation to explain it in detail / try it out..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for any help you can provide
