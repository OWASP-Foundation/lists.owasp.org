This is the announcement for the forthcoming full-day OWASP training on
OWASP projects and resources on May 28, 2010.  Signup is open (see links at
the bottom of the email). Spaces are limited (right now we only have 23
spaces available), so first come first served.

 



 

*	Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most OWASP Projects
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project>  are not widely used
and understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of quality and
usefulness of those Document & Tool projects, but due to a lack of
understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem or in
the Web Application Development Life-cycle.

*	This course aims to change that by providing a selection of mature
and enterprise ready projects together with practical examples of how to use
them.

*	If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of
the course, please bring a laptop.
*	All OWASP Training Material can be downloaded from here
<http://code.google.com/p/owasp-training/downloads/list> .

 

Please note that this training is free, but is currently open to only OWASP
Members. However, if you've been looking for a good reason to join as an
OWASP Member its only USD$50 to join for a year (approximately ?33 at
current exchange rates).

I'd recommend Gatwick (can get train into London Bridge near to the venue) or London City (take DLR/Jubilee line to venue).

Hi Valentine,

Commercial email shots like the following are not appropriate for this mailing list. OWASP is non-commercial and does not endorse any specific commercial activity (such as training) and therefore this type of content should not be posted to the mailing list.  Please refrain from any other postings like this as this list is currently moderated and we would like to keep it that way.

However, if you've been looking for a good reason to join as an OWASP Member
its only USD$50 to join for a year (approximately ?33 at current exchange
