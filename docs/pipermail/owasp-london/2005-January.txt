Hi all,

Hope the christmas period was good for all?
How does everyone feel about a end of January meeting, in the same 
location as last time?

Batteries recharged but liver stressed and wallet emptied ;-)

End of Jan or even early Feb sounds good.

Can someone recommend a decent insurance company (for my professional 
indemnity insurance), and a solicitor familiar with the computer 
security business?

Thanks.

So it seems the last place we had the meeting had decided to not use a
telephone anymore, and im unable to get hold of them.

Does anyone have any suggestions for a venue in central london?

Thanks

Daniel

Hi All,

Just to let you know that the first meeting of 2005 will be held on the
3rd of Feb, at the George IV pub in Holborn http://tinyurl.com/6ae7k, from
6.30 onwards.

The George IV has recently changed owners and now are charging for the
hire of the venue (i will personally pickup this one, but we should
discuss a new venue for all future meetings that has the facility for
presentations)

I'm still looking for people who want to talk about any aspect of
application security, so far we have:

- Steve Darrall talking about search engine hacking

If you would like to talk, please contact me via e-mail or call 079211 666 77

Looking foward to seeing you there
