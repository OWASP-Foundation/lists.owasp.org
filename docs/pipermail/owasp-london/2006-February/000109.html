<PRE>Hello, 

On March 9th 2006, Thursday, there will be another Owasp-London Chapter gathering  somewhere in London  (I am still deciding on the venue (if anybody has a good location which they can facilitate or sponsor, please contact me ASAP)).

In this session, I am very happy to announce that Owasp founder Mark Curphey will deliver a presentation on the night's topic &quot;Naked Application Security - A striped back look at the industry today&quot;. I (Dinis Cruz) will also deliver a presentation on the latest developments at Owasp, the forthcoming European Owasp Conference, and the new Owasp tools SiteGenerator and VulnReport.

So, currently the schedule looks like this:

6:00 pm - Arrive at location and order some beers and food
7:00 pm - Move to presentation venue (if different)
7:30 pm - Dinis Cruz presentation &quot; Latest developments at Owasp, the forthcoming European Owasp Conference, and the new Owasp tools SiteGenerator and VulnReport&quot;
8:15 pm - Mark Curphey presentation &quot; Naked Application Security - A striped back look at the industry today&quot;
9:00 pm - Roundtable discussion about Mark's presentation and &quot;What next? How to turn the boat to the right direction?&quot;

Any Comments? Suggestions? Ideas?

Please let me know (<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">dinis.cruz at owasp.net</A>) if you are planning in attending so that I have an idea of the numbers.

Best regards
