<PRE>This is the announcement for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to
be held on September 3rd (Thursday), at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue
between 6pm-6:30pm).

We're at a different location this time, at Lloyds TSB who have kindly
agreed to let us use their facilities:

Lloyds TSB, 5th Floor Seminar Room, Red Lion Court, London SE1 9EQ

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should
have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well
and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

If you are planning to attend please RSVP. Please RSVP at
<A HREF="http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.">http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.</A> Note, please enter your real name, as
this will be given to Lloyds TSB building security to ensure you are let
into the building.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">justin.clarke at owasp.org</A> so your space can be released for someone else.

We have a couple of interesting talks this time around - one being the talk
that Dinis couldn't give at July's meeting due to travel commitments, and
another more general security problem focused that looks at one way to not
have to handle sensitive information within an application (and very PCI
relevant).

* O2 - Advanced Source Code Analysis Toolkit - Dinis Cruz

In this talk Dinis Cruz will show the open source toolkit O2 (Ounce Open)
which is specifically designed for developers and security consultants to be
able to perform quick, effective and thorough source code security reviews.
The O2 toolkit (<A HREF="http://www.o2-ounceopen.com">http://www.o2-ounceopen.com</A>) uses the scanning engines from
Ounce Labs,  Microsoft's CAT.NET tool and FindBugs (with more engines to be
added soon) and allows advanced filtering, manipulation and visualization of
its findings. In the past, there has been a very healthy skepticism on the
usability of Source Code analysis engines to find commonly found
vulnerabilities in real world applications. This presentation will show that
with some creative and powerful tools, it IS possible to use O2 to discover
those issues. 

* Using Surrogates to Protect from Application Data Breach - Dave Marsh

Companies are being challenged to store Personal Identifiable Information
(PII) data in increasingly more secure environments, and also to comply with
increasing standards of data security, for instance Payment Card Industry&#8217;s
Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Because all systems that accept or use
PII/CC data are considered &#8220;in scope&#8221; for compliance, there are very few
ways to &#8220;cut corners&#8221; when seeking compliance, and at the same time maintain
your current business model.

This session will present a concept and use of a new data security model,
tokenization, which substitutes &#8220;data surrogates&#8221; for PII/CC numbers in
systems throughout the enterprise, thus reducing scope for compliance and
annual audits, as well as lowering the risk of a data breach. This session
will cover:

1) The value of a centralized data vault for PII/CC data
2) How tokens act as data surrogates
3) Using surrogates for masked data
4) The importance of a one-to-one token/data relationship
5) How tokens are generated, and
6) The security benefits of centralized key management

Speakers

* Dave Marsh is an internationally recognised IT security consultant with
over 17 years experience of designing and implementing high security digital
money transfer systems. Dave?s background has enabled him to focus on
understanding the business challenges of security standards compliance and
how to address the needs of people, process, and technology. In addition to
his other activities, Dave is currently involved in delivering PCI DSS
compliance training courses to one of Britain's leading Building Societies.
He is a Member of the Institute of Information Security Professionals
(M.Inst.ISP) and Certified Information Systems Security Professional
(CISSP).

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the
chapter page ( <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London</A> ).

See you there!
