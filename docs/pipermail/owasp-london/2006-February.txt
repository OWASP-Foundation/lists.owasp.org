Subject: [Owasp-london] Owasp London March 9th meeting: "Naked Application Security - A striped back look at the industry today" with special guest Mark Curphey
Message-ID: <45c2bb5fc010439dac20c3c4575ca79e@ddplus.net>

Hello, 

On March 9th 2006, Thursday, there will be another Owasp-London Chapter gathering  somewhere in London  (I am still deciding on the venue (if anybody has a good location which they can facilitate or sponsor, please contact me ASAP)).

In this session, I am very happy to announce that Owasp founder Mark Curphey will deliver a presentation on the night's topic "Naked Application Security - A striped back look at the industry today". I (Dinis Cruz) will also deliver a presentation on the latest developments at Owasp, the forthcoming European Owasp Conference, and the new Owasp tools SiteGenerator and VulnReport.

So, currently the schedule looks like this:

6:00 pm - Arrive at location and order some beers and food
7:00 pm - Move to presentation venue (if different)
7:30 pm - Dinis Cruz presentation " Latest developments at Owasp, the forthcoming European Owasp Conference, and the new Owasp tools SiteGenerator and VulnReport"
8:15 pm - Mark Curphey presentation " Naked Application Security - A striped back look at the industry today"
9:00 pm - Roundtable discussion about Mark's presentation and "What next? How to turn the boat to the right direction?"

Any Comments? Suggestions? Ideas?

Please let me know (dinis.cruz at owasp.net) if you are planning in attending so that I have an idea of the numbers.

Best regards

Dinis Cruz
