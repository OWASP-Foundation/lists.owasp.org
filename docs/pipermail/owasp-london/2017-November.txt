Subject: [Owasp-london] OWASP London Meet-Ups in November 2017 and a special
	guest
Message-ID: <8f80ba29-53df-129b-51a9-f33112a8bd96@owasp.org>

All,

November is going to be a busy month for us: OWASP Board Elections (have 
you voted yet?), a CTF and... there will be not one, but *two* OWASP 
London Chapter Meetings in November!

We are pleased to announce that Jeff Williams - the co-founder of the 
OWASP Foundation, creator of OWASP Top 10 project, WebGoat and a 
co-author and contributor to many other OWASP projects has kindly agreed 
to present a talk during his visit to London - hence the additional meetup.

These are the dates of the upcoming meet-ups:

23rd November 2017 (6:30pm) - OWASP London Chapter Meeting kindly hosted 
and sponsored by The Telegraph Media Group:

Talks:

  * "How To Hack the UK Online Tax System, I Guess" - Thomas Shadwell
    (@zemnmez)
  * "SHA-3 vs the World" - David Wong (@lyon01_david)

    Williams (@planetlevel)

https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/owasp-london-chapter-meeting-thursday-30th-november-2017-630pm-tickets-39466707986?aff=ml

Talk details and speaker bios for both events are available on our webpage:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London

Please note that space at each event is limited to 100 attendees and we 
expect both events to 'sell-out' very quickly, so please only book 
tickets if you are definitely able to attend.

We will live-stream and video-record both events. Additionally the event 
on the 30th November 2017 featuring Jeff Williams will be live-streamed 
on the video-wall of Just Eat offices in Bristol in collaboration with 
our colleagues from the OWASP Bristol Chapter


Looking forward to seeing you.

Regards,

Sam Stepanyan and Sherif Mansour
OWASP London Chapter Leaders

Subject: [Owasp-london] Reminder: OWASP Board Election 2017 - last few days
	left to vote!
Message-ID: <dd6025b7-0fca-bf97-4148-56d346a5b51a@owasp.org>

OWASP Members: This reminder is for you - the voting will close on 
Thursday 9th November 2017!

All eligible OWASP members should have received an e-ballot via e-mail 
by now with subject "OWASP Board Election Open With Clean Slate - Please 
Vote" asking you to vote even if you have already voted before 19th 
October 2017. Due to an admin error the previous vote tallies have been 
zeroed out and the voting process was restarted on the 19th October 2017.

The Board Election email that you should have received includes a 
specific link for you to cast your vote.

It is critically important that our community participate in this 
important election in which we will be choosing four new OWASP Board 
members.

mp3 format):
