<PRE>Apologies all for the last minute announcement as we've had some venue
issues that have slowed things down, however we are planning on having an
OWASP meeting this coming Thursday the 14th of April (final time and venue
announcement details to follow - somewhere in central London).

We have two interesting talks/topics of discussion :-

- A talk from Steve Lord on Wordpress Security
- a discussion of outcomes from the recent OWASP Summit in Portugal, &quot;OWASP
4.0&quot; and what is changing in the OWASP world now and in the near future

Abstract of Steve's talk:
Wordpress is one if the most popular blogging systems in the world but is
routinely used to shoehorn complex sites into a blog shaped box, often
because of it's flexibility and ease of use. In this talk, Mandalorian's
Steve Lord discusses common Wordpress security snafus and how to avoid them.

Steve's Bio:
Steve Lord is a technical director at Mandalorian, a Reading-based security
consultancy practice. When not helping developers secure their applications,
Steve reverse engineers malware and kicks out the bad guys. Steve dislikes
writing in the third person form.

As usual, we will have an RSVP running at <A HREF="http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.">http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.</A>
Please feel free to RSVP now so we know how many are planning on coming, and
more details will follow shortly as we confirm them.

best regards

Justin
