<PRE>Reminding you all that we are having an OWASP London chapter meeting this coming Thursday the 14th of April (i.e. tomorrow). We're at a new venue, courtesy of our meeting sponsor Glue Reply, who will also be putting some nibbles on for the evening. The location is:

Charterhouse Bar
38 Charterhouse Street
Smithfield
London
EC1M 6JH

Please arrive on or after 6:30pm for a 7pm start. As always, attendance is FREE, and you don't have to be an OWASP member to come along.

We have a number of items on the agenda, including a whole bunch of giveaways to those who RSVP and turn up on the day, including:
- a ticket to the upcoming OWASP AppSec EU conference in Dublin
- (new item) a copy of &quot;Implementing SSL/TLS: Using Cryptography and PKI&quot;, supplied by Ivan Ristic on behalf of the author

Remember - you need to be there to win, and for the AppSec EU ticket you need to RSVP at EventBrite!!

On the agenda, we have the following two interesting talks/topics of discussion :-

Wordpress Security - Steve Lord
- Wordpress is one if the most popular blogging systems in the world but is routinely used to shoehorn complex sites into a blog shaped box, often because of it's flexibility and ease of use. In this talk, Mandalorian's Steve Lord discusses common Wordpress security snafus and how to avoid them.

Outcomes from the recent OWASP Summit in Portugal - London based attendees of the Summit
- Discussion of what came out of the recent OWASP Summit, &quot;OWASP 4.0&quot; and what is changing in the OWASP world now and in the near future

As usual, we will have an RSVP running at <A HREF="http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.">http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.</A> Please RSVP so we know how many are planning on coming.

best regards

Justin Clarke
London OWASP Chapter
