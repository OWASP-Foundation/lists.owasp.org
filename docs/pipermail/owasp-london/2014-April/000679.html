&#8226; Application Security with Hardware Roots of Trust - Rick Doten

Hardware-based security is an unfortunately seldom-leveraged solution to protect our enterprises by bringing a root of trust for system, user identity, and encryption of data. By insuring that only authorised users authenticate using cryptological certificates stored in secure hardware chips of PCs, tablets, and phones, we can also provide more granular application control of data to increase privacy.

The core of trusted computing already exists in most PC systems today. Many PC&#8217;s include a dormant Trusted Platform Module (TPM) that uses a standard from the Trusted Computing Group (TCG). The TPM can be activated to encrypt hard drives on the hardware level, provide controlled network access, and deliver measurements on boot process for unauthorised changes. With an abstraction layer called the Trusted Software Stack (TSS) specification, we can leverage this strong authentication into applications. We can also use this credential for data encryption that can&#8217;t be man-in-the-middle attacked like SSL, while giving the opportunity to digitally sign data and documents. Further, we can utilize hardware measurements to provide a level of system trust, which we could use to dynamically alter application access and functionality based on that trust level.

This presentation will provide an overview of these current and future application security capabilities, and how developers will soon be able to leverage hardware roots of trust to make more secure applications.
