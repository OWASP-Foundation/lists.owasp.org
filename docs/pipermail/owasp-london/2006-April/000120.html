<PRE>&gt;<i>I am thinking that it would be a good idea to do the next Owasp-London
</I>&gt;<i>meeting at the same time of the InfoSecurity conference in London (25th
</I>&gt;<i>to 27th of April) on the topic &quot;Web Application Firewalls: Where do they
</I>&gt;<i>add value and who should be using them'
</I>
Excellent idea. 

&gt;<i>The format would be to have one or several vendors come in and do a 15m
</I>&gt;<i>presentation about their product (probably using it to defend against
</I>&gt;<i>SiteGenerator) followed by a panel discussion about them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My main objective for the night will be to highlight the areas where Web
</I>&gt;<i>Application Firewalls are very effective (and deliver real value), and
</I>&gt;<i>the areas where they are useless.
</I>
A couple of months ago I was at a OWASP Boston meeting with a similar topic. It was very interesting and I learned a lot. Netcontinuum (<A HREF="http://www.netcontinuum.com/">http://www.netcontinuum.com/</A>) did the presentation and they or one of their distributors might be intrested in speaking in London as well.

Perhaps you should consider giving the vendor a bit more time to explain the concepts and ideas behind application firewalls. In Boston I think the talk was 60 minutes.

If Netcontinuum looks interesting I can ask them if they are interested in speaking.

Best regards
