What did you had in mind?

Anything that can take from 5 to 20 bodies should be fine

> I can be there (in London) any time after 16:00

That is good for me too

Have you thought of an Agenda for the meeting?

If we publish a press release about this event then it is likely that
non-owasp members will attend, so it would be good to do a quick
presentation on OWASP and what it is doing

ok so i've failed to find a venue on the city where we can have a separate
room, and the owners dont want 200 pounds to do it in.

any tips on venue's would be met with happiness and jubilation at this stage!

Dan,

What development languages are you after?

October Systems resell a number of specialist CBT courses.  Given that you
sent the email to the OWASp DotNet list as well, perhaps: ".NET Security for
Developers"?


Checkout http://www.october-systems.co.uk/a-z.shtml

I don't know how good it is tho!


Cheers,

Gunter
