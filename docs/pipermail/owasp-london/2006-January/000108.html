<PRE>&gt;<i>Hi I'm new to the list and have initially joined because I am in need of
</I>&gt;<i>advice. I am not by any stretch of the imagination and expert in this
</I>&gt;<i>field. Being new to the list please excuse any gaps in protocol - I am
</I>&gt;<i>willing to be told if there are.
</I>
I am not sure if you are supposed to discuss technical issues on this list, but given that the traffic on the list is extremely low I don't really see the harm of some technical discussions. If I am wrong please tell me so.

&gt;<i>This customer has now written an HTTP service for his application in
</I>&gt;<i>order to allow his database user to exchange data with local system they
</I>&gt;<i>are running on their PCs/Local LANs. The system does not have any HTML
</I>&gt;<i>interface and is purely a means of data exchange between his bespoke
</I>&gt;<i>OpenInsight database systems and the local ones using XML. I have been
</I>&gt;<i>charged with the task of rolling this out. I am looking for a means of
</I>&gt;<i>testing this service, as I have no way of knowing at the moment whether,
</I>&gt;<i>when running and listening on a public port to the farm it poses any
</I>&gt;<i>vulnerabilities. If you can suggest a lead for this I would be grateful.
</I>
It sounds like the client wants to set up some kind of XML RPC / database sync on top of a HTTP transport channel. There are two separate issues that you must consider. 

The first is if the clients application as a standalone world is secure or not. Is there any form of authentication between the local database and the OpenInsight database? Is data encrypted and/or signed before it is sent over the open Internet?

The second issue is if it is possible to use the clients application as a vehicle to break into your system.

The first issue is perhaps not your problem, but the second one definately is.

The way to mitigate the risk is either to install a correctly configured XML firewall before the application, to harden the application (XML pen testing, source code scanning, etc) or to tunnel the connection over some kind of VPN.

Please contact me if you want to discuss this issue further.

Best regards
