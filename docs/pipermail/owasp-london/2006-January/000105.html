<PRE>Hi All,

I hope nobody minds my promoting this event, I think it is important to
members on the list. The person organising it (Eddie Bleasdale from
NetProject) was the person who stood up at the end of the SANS Top 20 list
of Software Vulnerabilities, and basically said that the recommended
approach to spending all our energies on patching, etc was not the way
forward for the future of Security. There is a cover article in this months
SC Magazine.

Details are at: <A HREF="http://www.netproject.com/events/trusted_computing.html">http://www.netproject.com/events/trusted_computing.html</A>

The objectives of this conference are to:
- raise awareness of the need for trusted computing;
- outline the options that are available;
- highlight the implications of deploying trusted systems;
- discuss the steps that have to be taken to ensure the smooth migration to
systems that can be trusted to do e-business /e-government/e-banking.

Speakers include:
- Eddie Bleasdale, CEO, netproject
- Dr David Everett, CEO, Smart Card Group
- David Aucsmith, Senior Director, Institute for Advanced Technology in
Governments, Microsoft Corporation
- Alan Cox, Lead Linux Kernel Developer and Security Architect
- Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering, University of Cambridge
Computer Lab

The juxtaposition of speakers looks set to make for a lively and informative
meeting on a subject that goes to the heart of current problems on both
security and identity. I am told that the room will take a hundred and that
sixty places are already spoken for.

This conference is being held at:
The DTI Conference Centre, Victoria Street, London, On Thursday 26th Jan
from 9am to 1:30pm.

Attendance is free to IT managers/strategists.
To make a booking please send an email to <A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">info at netproject.com</A> with the name
of the delegate.

Regards
Sarb Sembhi
