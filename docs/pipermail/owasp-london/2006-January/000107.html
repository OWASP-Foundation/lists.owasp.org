Hi I'm new to the list and have initially joined because I am in need of
advice. I am not by any stretch of the imagination and expert in this
field. Being new to the list please excuse any gaps in protocol - I am
willing to be told if there are.

Ok to my dilemma:- 

I currently supply and manage a server farm for a customer that sells
services via an application he has developed. The system uses RDP over
the internet and thus to now, has not posed any extraordinary security
threats.

This customer has now written an HTTP service for his application in
order to allow his database user to exchange data with local system they
are running on their PCs/Local LANs. The system does not have any HTML
interface and is purely a means of data exchange between his bespoke
OpenInsight database systems and the local ones using XML. I have been
charged with the task of rolling this out. I am looking for a means of
testing this service, as I have no way of knowing at the moment whether,
when running and listening on a public port to the farm it poses any
vulnerabilities. If you can suggest a lead for this I would be grateful.
