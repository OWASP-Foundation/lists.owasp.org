Subject: [Owasp-london] COI - Browser Standards Consultation
Message-ID: <20081010143333.93d09ce6@mail.watsonhall.com>

The government's Central Office of Information (COI) public consultation on browser standards for public websites is undergoing consultation:

   COI - Browser Standards Consultation
   http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=200
   
Whilst the document seems primarily to be discussing usability, the requirements for testing a public sector site "works in common browsers" are to check: 

   1 content
   2 functionality and
   3 display.

Nothing is mentioned about security.

There's already plenty of feedback from elsewhere about the choice of browsers, standards, etc:

   http://www.webstandards.org/2008/09/08/uk-government-draft-browser-guidance-is-daft-browser-guidance/
 
   http://www.thepickards.co.uk/index.php/200809/public-sector-browser-standards/

   http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/response-browser-standards-consultation

but perhaps OWASP London and/or OWASP Scotland could submit comments on the draft document, or we could submit a joint response about our particular interest - security?  I'm not thinking we should comment on the selection of browsers, but rather making sure that security is considered during testing.  After all, some browsers and versions which are popular may mean the user is more at risk from vulnerabilities on the web site?

i saw this a while ago and thought it was a step forward that they
even mentioned linux or firefox or safari.
opera seems to get a bit of a rough deal.

The main problem for .gov.uk is that so many proprietry apps depend on
ie6 that even suggesting that websites have to be cross-platform is a
massive leap forward.

I would be more than happy to contribute to any sort of joint effort
in imparting some kloo wrt security.

This got me thinking.  If the COI isn't responsible for maintaing secure government websites, then who is?  I had a good Google around and was directed mainly toward NHCTU resources, which mainly deal with incidents posthumously.

Is it really the case that on one hand, the COI is responsible for information, yet another department - MI5 or 'the police' are responsible for securing it?

The only true regulation of government websites is the 7th Data Protection Principle of the DPA, which appears humbly in the COI's list of 'legal issues' - http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=164.  This recommends publishing organisations to take a 'risk-based approach to security matters'.  So, whilst the over-riding objective of the COI is to publish information and ensure everyone can see it, they still have the obligation to secure it.

The government takes a statistical approach to security matters - if it's happened before, it's likely to happen again.  If USB sticks go missing, government introduces a re-clarification of what was already hidden in 3 or 400 pages of security policy and mandates USB device encryption (or prohibition).  If backup disks go missing, government tightens up 3rd party contracts and sacks a few suppliers.  If a government web site gets hacked, they fix it.  Quietly...

Being in the business, I know that each and every government web site gets thoroughly pen tested before release by a CHECK member, and re-tested annually.  I'd certainly take it as read that the websites the COI is attempting to standardize are already highly secure and the main problem that's trying to be addressed is that they were all coded to work with IE 6 (which, to say the least, didn't always understand HTML).



Regards,



Tim

Do you think its true every government web site is tested this way?  How about local councils, associations and project-orientated .gov.uk web sites

   site:.gov.uk

I hope you are right.  Then we could discuss .nhs.uk, .ac.uk, .bl.uk, .police.uk etc.

Following the correspondence earlier this week Guillaume, Mike and I have drafted a response below (now called Draft 2).  We might be hopeful about getting all these references to OWASP included, but it's worth a try.

We plan to send this to COI tomorrow, unless someone with an OWASP.ORG email address could send it for us.

=================================================
DRAFT 2
=================================================
Subject: OWASP UK Chapters - Formal response to browser standards for public sector websites
=================================================

About OWASP
-----------

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated to enabling organisations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications that can be trusted.  All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.  OWASP advocates approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas.  OWASP can be found at http://www.owasp.org

OWASP has over 130 local chapters around the world.  Both the UK chapters (London and Scotland) have collaborated to create this joint response.

Introduction
------------

We welcome the work on web standards and guidelines, in particular the understanding that websites have to be cross-platform and that the COI document should "provide a method for creating a reasonable list of browsers for testing".

The 7th Data Protection Principle of the Data Protection Act, which appears in COI's list of 'legal issues' http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=164, recommends publishing organisations to take a 'risk-based approach to security matters'.  So, whilst the over-riding objective is to publish information and ensure everyone can see it, public sector and other organisations still have an obligation to secure it.

Cross-platform support, including security, should be built into all stages of website development, testing and operation i.e. throughout the software development life cycle.  The support of particular browsers and platforms should be built-in and not reliant on additional coding which could introduce additional vulnerabilities.  All data submitted by users and returned to them should be validated and secured, and where appropriate encryption used to protect sensitive data (such as log in forms) and for transfer.

A key issue is that while the website should be supported in popular browsers, this is not sufficient for testing purposes.  Developers/programmers needs to realise that people will try and access the content using "non-browser" tools to look for vulnerabilities and the website should be secure enough to protect users and itself from such threats.  This requires testing beyond "popular browsers".

OWASP has produced a Top 10 Guide to the most critical web application security flaws which is referenced by many leading government, financial (e.g. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), and corporate standards and is the Gold standard for web application security.  Two other reference points for website owners and developers are the OWASP Guide to Building Secure Web Applications and the OWASP Testing Guide.

OWASP Top Ten Project
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project

OWASP Guide to Building Secure Web Applications
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Guide_Project

OWASP Testing Guide
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project


Suggested amendments to the document
------------------------------------

Paragraph 30:  Add text "The critical security flaws identified in the OWASP Top Ten Project must be protected against in all browsers and tools, regardless of popularity."

Paragraph 40:  Add text "The website should be developed using practices such as those detailed in the OWASP Guide to Building Secure Web Applications and tested for security using the OWASP Testing Guide." and "Users critical data (passwords, account numbers, cash relative data, etc) must be encrypted as defined in standard security policies."

Paragraph 41:  Add a bullet point "Security - Is the user, their system and their data secure?"

Paragraph 46:  Add bullet points "Manipulation and addition/removal of form, URL, cookie and other header parameter values" and "Business logic"

Appendix A:    Add at end "Security issues must also be tested with no assumptions of browser type."

Appendix B:    Add to template table "Manipulation and addition/removal of form, URL, cookie and other header parameter values" and "Business logic"

I'm sorry, I meant to mention Tim's input to the draft (you might recognise some of the words) but forgot in my haste.  

Tim's sent some feedback directly to me, which I'm posting to the lists with his permission:

I suspect he may well be right - unfortunately.

I agree with Tim however I think that on the 1000 websites there will be  
around 5% asking for security
because security matters were present in the document, and for those 5  
percent I think that security
point have to be added ...

OWASP UK Chapters - Formal response to browser standards for public sector websites
=================================================

About OWASP
-----------

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated to enabling organisations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications that can be trusted.  All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.  OWASP advocates approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas.  OWASP can be found at http://www.owasp.org

OWASP has over 130 local chapters around the world.  Both the UK chapters (London and Scotland) have collaborated to create this joint response.

Introduction
------------

We welcome the work on web standards and guidelines, in particular the understanding that websites have to be cross-platform and that the COI document should "provide a method for creating a reasonable list of browsers for testing".

The 7th Data Protection Principle of the Data Protection Act, which appears in COI's list of 'legal issues' http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=164, recommends publishing organisations to take a 'risk-based approach to security matters'.  So, whilst the over-riding objective is to publish information and ensure everyone can see it, public sector and other organisations still have an obligation to secure it.

Cross-platform support, including security, should be built into all stages of website development, testing and operation i.e. throughout the software development life cycle.  The support of particular browsers and platforms should be built-in and not reliant on additional coding which could introduce additional vulnerabilities.  All data submitted by users and returned to them should be validated and secured, and where appropriate encryption used to protect sensitive data (such as log in forms) and for transfer.

A key issue is that while the website should be supported in popular browsers, this is not sufficient for testing purposes.  Developers/programmers needs to realise that people will try and access the content using "non-browser" tools to look for vulnerabilities and the website should be secure enough to protect users and itself from such threats.  This requires testing beyond "popular browsers".

OWASP has produced a Top 10 Guide to the most critical web application security flaws which is referenced by many leading government, financial (e.g. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), and corporate standards and is the Gold standard for web application security.  Two other reference points for website owners and developers are the OWASP Guide to Building Secure Web Applications and the OWASP Testing Guide.

Suggested amendments to the document
------------------------------------

Paragraph 30:  Add text "The critical security flaws identified in the OWASP Top Ten Project must be protected against in all browsers and tools, regardless of popularity."

Paragraph 40:  Add text "The website should be developed using practices such as those detailed in the OWASP Guide to Building Secure Web Applications and tested for security using the OWASP Testing Guide." and "Users critical data (passwords, account numbers, cash relative data, etc) must be encrypted as defined in standard security policies."

Paragraph 41:  Add a bullet point "Security - Is the user, their system and their data secure?"

Paragraph 46:  Add bullet points "Manipulation and addition/removal of form, URL, cookie and other header parameter values" and "Business logic"

Appendix A:    Add at end "Security issues must also be tested with no assumptions of browser type."

Appendix B:    Add to template table "Manipulation and addition/removal of form, URL, cookie and other header parameter values" and "Business logic"
