Hi all,

Thought you might be interested in attending this one:

Microsoft Developer Security Event with Top Independent Security
Expert Howard Schmidt

This is your chance to meet top security expert Howard Schmidt and
attend an evening event that will give you a valuable overview of
developer security in the UK and the Trustworthy Computing Initiative.
Howard has a wealth of experience in this field from his time at eBay,
Microsoft, US White House and US Air Force and will provide his
perspective on what we must do now and in the long term to provide
secure software assurance.

But discussion is better than listening =96 so arm yourself with your
key developer security questions and ask our expert panel.  The last
hour will be dedicated to your questions, with the panel of Howard
Schmidt, Microsoft, and Security partner SPI Dynamics and we'll be
collecting questions on the night.
