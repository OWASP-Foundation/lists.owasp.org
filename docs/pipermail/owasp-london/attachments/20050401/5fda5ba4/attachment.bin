Funnily enough i agree!


the CMA was designed to be so wide open, that when they did catch
someone who broke into a system, the law was able to come down on them
like a ton of bricks.

The problem at the moment is that lawyers, and the courts, have no
understanding of computer security law and thus treat it like normal
unauthorized entry.


The worst part about this whole saga is that the CCU have destroyed my
earning capabilities and hence whilst i wait for this to finish, i sit
at home making music and twiddling my thumbs (so much for this
innocent until proven guilty lark)


The hearing is next week thursday and yes we do have a brilliant legal
team and case prepared and i expect some red faces to be shown when we
do go to court.


Thanks for the support all

 What is very serious about this case is how the UK's CCU (Computer
Crime Unit) and the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service)  are able to
prosecute somebody in such manner (being arrested on the workplace)
and under such accusations.


 Since this could happen to any of us, we should all take this case
very seriously and be involved as much as we can.


 This case just shows how the current version of the UK's CMA
(Computer Misuse Act) is completed out of sync with the real-world and
is an 'almost' useless piece of legislation which is very inefficient
in catching the bad guys, but is very effectively used against the
good guys (for example if you tell anybody that they have a
vulnerability in their website, server or application you can be
reported to the CCU under the CMA). 


 In fact we should start a lobby group to put pressure to change this
law so that:

  

     a) the 'intent' of the 'accuser' is taken into account (the
current version of the CAM is used by companies to 'shut-up' anybody
that is 'telling them' that about vulnerabilities in their products)


     b) the definition of 'authorized access' is very clear (If you
look careful to the current version of the CMA, almost all of us are
potential criminals, since It could be argued that we don't have
explicit authorization to access most systems we (legitimaly) access
during our normal work (note that this could include most software
(except probably the Operating System) that we install in our computers


 Just for the record...

 Afternoon all,


 As some of you may know, i was recently accused of "hacking" into a
charity website.

 Obviously for legal reasons i cannot go into the full detail, but you
can take my word that this charge is so far from the truth, its
shocking.


 I never did any hacking, of any form, on the website in question and
wouldn't even dream of it. I actually was giving a donation at the
time and my concern was with the way the site presented itself and
also the security of my personal details (address/credit card etc)


 Unfortunately the downside of this is that the whole thing has
destroyed any form of career i had within IT security (but given me
time to work on OWASP stuff since I'm not able to work in this
industry, thanks to the fine gentlemen who make up the met computer
crime unit)


 The next London meeting will be in late April, Ivan Ristic has
gratefully offered to sponsor the event, it will be in the same
location, but we still need a projector and speakers.

 Anyone wanting to speak at the next event, please contact me off the
list.


 Don't always believe what you read in the papers, they only report on
small aspects of the full truth and even then they seem to balls it up.
