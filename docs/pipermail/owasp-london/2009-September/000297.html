Hi Jason,
This is good presentation of OWASP. The Universities and Educational Centres also understand why they want to become OWASP members. 

Thanks &amp; Regards,

hi Jason et al,

I've prepared a short presentation which details the benefits and requirements of becoming an OWASP Educational Supporter.

I am using this document when approaching Universities and Educational Centers asking them to become OWASP members.




Please feel free to use it and obviously comments/feedback are always welcome.

Thank you,

Fabio Cerullo
OWASP Global Education Committee

Hi, I'm sure in this list is people who can help (or can make this happen)



 



The OWASP Global Education Committee is doing a great job (see links below) and now (following their success in the US) they are trying to get more UK Universities involved.



 



Note that is no charge for Universities (see <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership#Categories_of_Membership_.26_Supporters">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership#Categories_of_Membership_.26_Supporters</A>) all we need
 is their support and involvement.



 



Here are some links to the great work these guys are doing at the Global Education Committee (and Fabio, feel free to provide more info)





<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Education_Committee">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Education_Committee</A>

<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Education_Project">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Education_Project</A>


The problem is that I don't have that many contacts with UK Universities, so please put us in touch with the interested parties
