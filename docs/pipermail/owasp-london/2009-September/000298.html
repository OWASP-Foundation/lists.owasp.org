Please visit <A HREF="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/445437315">http://www.eventbrite.com/event/445437315</A> to RSVP a place !!!

Date: 14th October 6:00pm start

Location: Leeds Novotel, 4 Whitehall, Whitehall Quay, Leeds, LSI 4HR.

Schedule: 

6:00pm - 6:15pm Registration &amp; refreshments

6:15pm - 6:30pm OWASP Leeds Chapter Presentation - Jason Alexander

Introduction to OWASP and its charter. Leeds Chapter details.

6:30pm - 7:30pm &quot;The right way to secure Oracle&quot; - Pete Finnigan

The talk covers the process of securing an Oracle database but with a proper
focus to the task rather than simply following a checklist. A checklist is
fine for general hardening but not for securing data as there is no method
to ensure that the data that must be protected has indeed been protected.

7:30pm - 8:30pm &quot;SQL Injection - how far does the rabbit hole go? &quot; - Justin
Clarke 

SQL Injection has been around for over 10 years, and yet it is still to this
day not truly understood by many security professionals and developers. With
the recent mass attacks against sites across the world it has again come to
the fore of vulnerabilities under the spotlight, however many consider it to
only be a data access issue, or parameterized queries to be a panacea.
Explore some of the deeper, darker danger areas of SQL Injection, hybrid
attacks, and exploiting obscure database functionality, and what we could
possibly expect to see next out of this venerable application security
issue.
