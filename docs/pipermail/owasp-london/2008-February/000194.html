<PRE>Our next meeting will be in the first week of April, to coincide
with the second OWASP Day. The target for the OWASP Day is currently
be April 1st, which is a Tuesday.

The format of the meeting will remain the same. If you have an
interesting topic that you'd like to talk about please contact
me to discuss it. Also please get in touch if you know someone
that might be interested to talk, or if there's a speaker you'd
like me to invite.

For your information, we almost managed to organise an one-day
mini conference in London in April. A large organisation, which
will remain nameless unless their involvement becomes official,
offered to sponsor the event. But we didn't manage to move things
quickly enough and so decided to postpone the event for later this
year, most likely September.

I will keep you updated. Getting sponsorship is only part of the
effort. To organise a good event we will need to advertise it
properly, which requires both time and work. I will need your help.

In other news, I am planning to set the dates for all our 2008
meetings and to have an official CFP open. This will allow for
things to be more predictable and the content quality higher.
