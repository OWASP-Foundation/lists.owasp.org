<PRE>I have confirmed the meeting for Thursday, April 3rd, at the
same place as before:

   Auriol Kensington Rowing Club
   <A HREF="http://www.akrowing.com/page.php?page=findus">http://www.akrowing.com/page.php?page=findus</A>

The official part will run between 7pm and 9pm, with half an
hour between and after for socialising (the whole event thus
beginning at 6:30pm and ending at 9:30pm).

There is enough time for two talks and a discussion. All
three slots are open at this time.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The format of the meeting will remain the same. If you have an

</I>&gt;<i> me to discuss it. Also please get in touch if you know someone

</I>&gt;<i> like me to invite.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For your information, we almost managed to organise an one-day
</I>&gt;<i> mini conference in London in April. A large organisation, which
</I>&gt;<i> will remain nameless unless their involvement becomes official,
</I>&gt;<i> offered to sponsor the event. But we didn't manage to move things
</I>&gt;<i> quickly enough and so decided to postpone the event for later this
</I>&gt;<i> year, most likely September.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will keep you updated. Getting sponsorship is only part of the
</I>&gt;<i> effort. To organise a good event we will need to advertise it
</I>&gt;<i> properly, which requires both time and work. I will need your help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In other news, I am planning to set the dates for all our 2008
</I>&gt;<i> meetings and to have an official CFP open. This will allow for
</I>&gt;<i> things to be more predictable and the content quality higher.
