Justin,

I think the results of the study on Enforcement Notices are very interesting
and should be taken for what for what they are: "a study on Enforcement
Notices from the ICO". What would be good as a next step is to ask the ICO
under the Freedom of Information Act questions around why those issues
raised by you and others in this discussion are such and what if anything
does the Office intend to do about it going forward.

If you or anyone in this group wants to take this up with the ICO, that
would be really great, if not, I'd be happy to do that and feed the response
back to this group. Let me know.

Cheers

Sadly, I think you're probably right.  I also agree with Jim that this is
likely largely an information problem. Firstly, and organisation may not
even be aware that they have had a breach from a web application attack.
Also, in the case that they are aware of a breach they may not be able to
quantify the problem through lack of logged information.  I've only come
across one instance where an organisation we've worked with had a good
record of exactly what data was exposed, and even in that case it was
largely blind luck that they had been logging that information...

In the case that an organisation with my data is aware they've had a breach
that they can't quantify I'd like to see them assume that the information
has been exposed and act accordingly, but do they see it that way?

regards

Justin

A good few web design/dev houses routinely disable all PHP or perl error logging on production systems.

 From the various code bases we have been asked to review simply enabling error logging is enough
to generate reams of warnings and errors that lead to semi-random result sets, bad logic and
SQL injection points.

And it seems this problem of "released unfit code" is growing. I *strongly* disagree with
error reporting being disabled on a live system as when things invariably go wrong it often helps
track down the problem.

It seems that certain WDH's are using the agile methodology to get code into a
"looks like it works" state and then shipping it thorough a scenario based acceptance test.
SQL injection holes, sem-random results, insane SQL etc are non issues.

This does keep costs down/profis up and the customers sysadmin is happy because there are
no logfiles to keep an eye on :-)
But this nasty "trick" makes my job ( often performance/security/mysql->pg migration)
absolute hell - its often cheaper to rewrite the app that try and fix the performance/migration
problems. Customers dont like to hear this about their perfect but "slow" business critical web app.

It's probably worth approaching the ICO directly first, rather than
via the procedural FoI request?  I suspect they would  engage with
organisations which support some of their objectives.  Perhaps we can
offer some advice on monitoring?

Good point, I was wondering if anyone wanted to approach the ICO as OWASP,
and that way the advice offered is actually thought to be independent and of
value.

Hi Sarb,

That would be great - please pass through to Colin and I and we'll reach out to them from one of the OWASP Global Committees.

Best regards

You may also be interested to know that the ICO are aware of their lack
of 'technical' understanding and that they're looking to establish a
Technology Reference Panel that will meet twice a year and provide
advice on an ad-hoc basis - maybe OWASP can help them here as well?

Hi Justin

Since I am the original cause of this - could I suggest that somebody 
has a quick look through the enforcements  
(http://www.ico.gov.uk/what_we_cover/data_protection/enforcement.aspx)  
just to make sure that I am not missing something obvious in my 
findings. I have just had another look - and certainly nothing jumped 
out, but it would be worth somebody else double-checking.

I would be happy to assist in contacting the ICO etc. Just one thing. I 
no longer live in the UK - but on top of a mountain in Switzerland, 
where we fight to retain our freedom from the EU and all that!

regards

Alexis

This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to be held on Thursday September 9th, at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between 6:00pm-6:30pm).

We're at a new location this time, at Deloitte who have kindly agreed to let us use their facilities:

Note that we're back to our normal time!

As always, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com. Note, please enter your real name, as this will be given to Deloitte building security. If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close the afternoon of the day before the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in advance.

==Talks==

CAT - Michael Jordon
Context Application Tool (CAT) is a tool for performing manual web application penetration testing. The presentation will show the main features of CAT with demonstrations of where CAT can perform tests that other tools currently available cannot and how CAT empowers the user to create more complex test cases to further explore the boundaries of the application. The focus of CAT is on manual penetration testing and not on automated web VA scanning. Also a sneak preview of the current features that are currently in development an due to be release late this year.
Security in the SDLC: IT Doesn't Have To Be Painful! - Matt Bartoldus
Why do organizations fail so miserably at Application Security? Even after investing millions into Information Security programs? Organizations are addressing application security through initiatives from hiring their first 'Security Person' to investing in large time and resource intensive projects. Great! So how come security breaches through applications are still on the rise and showing no signs of abatement? Is the security industry failing? This talk will focus on what the speaker has experienced over the past few years while working with his clients to integrate information security practices into IT processes. This includes large Global Top 100 to medium domestic UK companies. The focus will be around some of the different approaches that were taken and the things that worked and the things that failed miserably. In the end, the audience will be able to take away real world experiences for consideration. The talk will start by discussing some of the more interesting angles the speaker has seen when presenting the business case for a security integration project investment. This includes stepping outside of the traditional security professional arguments and adopting the viewpoint from other parts of an organization. The speaker will then discuss the age old IT consultant's mantra of People, Process and Technology and where security practices fits in. The focus will be on process and people rather than technology. Building upon a business case and the theories around people and processes, we will discuss how to move forward with integrating information security practices into the SDLC. Lastly, we'll talk about the 'gotchas', the pitfalls, traps, and other 'bad things' from perceptions to internal politics. These are discussed in a light-hearted manner through example experiences and 'war stories.' The speaker hopes they will be considered at the beginning of a security initiative or project part of project risk and critical success Factors!

	process/elections
Message-ID: <1E1F16E0-658D-42F2-A1DB-571F9E85B220@owasp.org>

All,

It's past time we expanded the London chapter from a one person coordination effort (i.e. me) to a larger group of folks, and therefore have the time to commit to building this to the next step.  As part of that, one of the things we need to sort out is an OWASP chapter board to coordinate our activity. Needless to say, this is an absolute prerequisite for us looking seriously at pitching for AppSec Europe in 2012 for example.

So, first steps - is anyone aware of a platform for holding organisational elections?  For example, something that would allow nominations to go up, and possibly ultimately to allow people to vote on candidates?  This would make running the process a lot smoother.... providing of course that some of you out there don't end up gaming the system ;-)

Best regards

* Samy Kamkar is best known for the Samy worm, the first XSS worm, infecting over one million users on MySpace in less than 24 hours. A co-founder of Fonality, Inc., an IP PBX company, Samy previously led the development of all top-level domain name server software and systems for Global Domains International (.ws). In the past 10 years, Samy has focused on evolutionary and genetic algorithmic software development, Voice over IP software development, automated security and vulnerability research in network security, reverse engineering, and network gaming. When not strapped behind the Matrix, Samy can be found stunt driving, getting involved in local community service projects, and continuing his focus on staying out of jail.

Hi Everyone,
 
In recent times our organisations Web development team asked our Internal Audit and Risk Management department if there were any industry best practice standards they should be adhering to around web development, or anything that they can reference in web development guides, and work towards in developing web applications with security in mind. 
 
At the time this was researched in great detail, and the only thing we could find and that was recommended that really ticked this box was OWASP ASVS. We agreed in principal that due to the type of applications we both develop and buy in, that they should all ideally be fully complaint with OWASP ASVS Level 2. 
 
With this in mind, our Web development team accordingly updated the web development policy to adhere to OWASP ASVS. Main issue being, some web applications used by our organisation are not internally developed, and in many cases are purchased from 3rd parties, and hosted externally. 
 
In a nutshell, we are having real issues with 3rd parties and trying to gauge their web applications compliance with OWASP ASVS. Many have never heard of OWASP ASVS, many claim ?this OWASP ASVS is an excessive and ridiculous level of control, nobody can be expected to comply with all of this anywhere? etc etc, so I was wondering if anyone on the mailing lists has been in a similar position when dealing with these 3rd parties and how you deal with them, or whether you are only responsible for internal developments as opposed to handling negotiations for 3rd party application providers. 
 
The main questions I wanted to run by the list was: 
 
a)      OWASP ASVS is basically a detailed code review and penetration test. Have you come across 3rd party penetration testing companies who provide OWASP ASVS compliance audits? If so can you provide some details? Is this a common service offered these days? 
 
b)      Do you reference OWASP ASVS is your organisations internal web development policies, or is there any other industry standard document that you have come across? I?ve yet to come across any other organisation that references OWASP ASVS in any web development or web security policy, so just knowing that we aren?t out on a whim asking for OWASP ASVS 2 compliance would be reassuring to say the least! 
 
c)       If you have any involvement in testing a 3rd parties compliance to OWASP ASVS for any 3rd party apps your sector/organisation buys in, how do you go about checking for OWASP ASVS compliance? I.e. do you request copies of independent penetration testing and then review the scope, or ask for documented evidence that issues found in the pen test have been remediated? Or do you have a different approach, i.e. ask for some documented compliance per OWASP ASVS control etc, and then manually verify a sample of these controls? 
 
d)      Do you know anyone organisations who reference OWASP ASVS in their own internal web development policies that you could give me a contact for? Maybe you are on this list? 
 
Any response would be greatly appreciated.
 
Regards

Hello

Some thoughts.

My first reaction would be to ask whether you could start more modestly 
and try initially to get to ASVS level 1 compliance.

While ASVS is a good idea,  it doesn't seem to have gained great 
traction as of yet, so I reckon you would be one of the (fairly) early 
adopters.

Your questions:

a) There don't seem to be (m)any companies offering OWASP ASVS 
compliance audits
b) and d) I have come across a small number of organisations who discuss 
it - but few who have formally adopted it. The OWASP ASVS page has a 
list of "ASVS users" - http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS. I haven't 
had much success in my efforts to introduce it!

c) Probably a good starting point would be to get copies of independent 
assessments.  Then of course who pays? For future projects you could 
look at specifying an ASVS level in the development contract.  There 
will be an associated cost with that - which your company will have to 
be willing to pay.

Im not sure that was very helpful - but some feedback anyway!

Alexis

Hi Guys,

Sorry I am bit late to join this discussion, but it's been very interesting
to see all the comments here. It's true that ASVS has not gained as much
momentum yet. But I am sure things are going change in near future.

I am working on the newer version of OWASP development guide which has
adopted the ASVS structure for the next version and I know atleast other two
guides (code review and testing guides) that are also going to adopt the
same structure to make all the three guides aligned to the ASVS standard. As
these three guides are in wide adoption, once the new versions of these
guides are released, people will know more about ASVS and will start asking
for it or may just start adopting it as part of these guides.

Regards
Vishal

Subject: [Owasp-london] Reminder - London OWASP Special Event (Samy Kamkar
	speaking) Friday the 1st of October,
	at Barclays Capital in Canary Wharf
Message-ID: <DCEFA9D3-B747-4063-9955-FE205FFB26C7@owasp.org>

This is the announcement for an OWASP London special meeting to be held on Friday October 1st, at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between 6:00pm-6:30pm).

This is to catch Samy Kamkar on his OWASP tour of Europe, so we are on a new day in a new venue (apologies for the late notice!)

We're at a new location this time, at Barclays Capital who have kindly agreed to let us use their facilities:
- Barclays Capital, 5 North Colonnade, Canary Wharf, London E14 4BB

As always, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com. Note, please enter your real name, as this will be given to Barclays building security. If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close the afternoon of the day before the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at justin.clarke at owasp.org so your space can be released for someone else.

===Talks===

* How I Met Your Girlfriend - Samy Kamkar
The discovery and execution of entirely new classes of attacks executed from the Web in order to meet your girlfriend. This includes newly discovered attacks including HTML5 client-side XSS (without XSS hitting the server!), PHP session hijacking and weak random numbers (accurately guessing PHP session cookies), browser protocol confusion (turning a browser into an SMTP server), firewall and NAT penetration via Javascript (turning your router against you), remote iPhone Google Maps hijacking (iPhone penetration combined with HTTP man-in-the-middle), extracting extremely accurate geolocation information from a Web browser (not using IP geolocation), and more

* Padding Oracle attacks (and ASP.NET 0-day) - Justin Clarke
Change of plan from the previous announcement - I'm going to go through Padding Oracle attacks (as recently re-popularised by Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo), as well as demoing the 0-day Padding Oracle attack on ASP.NET (time permitting). 

===Speakers===
* Samy Kamkar is best known for the Samy worm, the first XSS worm, infecting over one million users on MySpace in less than 24 hours. A co-founder of Fonality, Inc., an IP PBX company, Samy previously led the development of all top-level domain name server software and systems for Global Domains International (.ws). In the past 10 years, Samy has focused on evolutionary and genetic algorithmic software development, Voice over IP software development, automated security and vulnerability research in network security, reverse engineering, and network gaming. When not strapped behind the Matrix, Samy can be found stunt driving, getting involved in local community service projects, and continuing his focus on staying out of jail.

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the chapter page ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London ).

See you there!
