Hi all,

Some time ago I offered to help Dinis with the London Chapter
activities and he accepted. I guess that makes me the new
Chapter leader, so here I am. Let's see if I can help to move
things forward.

First of all, I think we need to face our current situation.

I've been attending the Chapter meetings on and off for the
past few years and I've always felt that the turnout is
generally low. I don't think that it's necessary now to try to
determine the reasons why. (But if there are people that are
willing to share their thoughts with us on this subject that
would be most useful.) I think we would be more productive
focusing on improving things. In preparing for this email I
talked to Chapter leaders that have high-attendance figures
(most notably, the Israel Chapter, led by Ofer Shezaf) and
asked for guidance.

Just for reference, some of the other chapters regularly have
attendance numbers near and over the 100 mark. This is what we
should be aiming for.

Here's what I've come up with:

 1 We need an audience. There is certainly no lack of IT and
   security people in London. We need to make them aware that we
   exist and get them to subscribe to our mailing list. We need
   to _interest_ them in what we're doing.

   The easiest way to do this is through word of mouth. For example,
   each member of this list could take upon himself (or herself) to
   recruit two new members.

 2 While meeting at pubs can be fun, it won't attract the kind
   of attendance and sponsorship we need to get things going. We thus
   need to switch from meeting in pubs to meeting at more work-like
   locations. Sponsor-provided locations or Universities come to mind.

   However, we will aim to have the sponsors provide refreshments,
   so not everything will be lost ;)

 3 Talk quality has never been an issue due to the wealth of talent
   available here in London. It would be interesting, however, to
   learn more about the Chapter members and have talks that are aligned
   with their interests.

 4 Bring the most interesting talks from OWASP Conferences, or
   at least brief the Chapter after each main conference.

 5 If any of the above is working, consider turning Chapter meetings
   into proper 1-day conferences. Keep the conferences free.

 6 Hold meetings every 3 or 6 months, depending on the format. If
   we end up having proper 1-day conferences I think we should do
   it once every 6 months.

These are some ideas to get us started. Hopefully they will be
sufficient to provoke some of you to respond and we'll have a
discussion, leading to a consensus.

Our hand is being forced, in a way, with the plan to participate in
the OWASP Day (Dinis already placed our name on the list ;), but I
will send a separate email on that topic. Soon.

Hi Ivan

I have to say I agree with everything you've said. I've also bcc'd 
several colleagues to this post to encourage them to get involved. A 
good start to your leadership!

Message-ID: <46c44ef1.697f.0@iol.ie>

Hello all,
I've just subscribed to OWASP London on a recommendation from a former
colleague. I'm a seasoned IT Professional with circa 20 years experience in
IT Infrastructure as a System Engineer, Pre Sales Solution Architect and
now as an Information Security Professional.
Fair to say I've had a variety of roles and experience.
I recently left IBM Global Services after 10 years and am currently in the
market for a contract / interim role. If anybody has any suggestions of
good resources and specialist recruiters in Information Security I'd be
greatly obliged.
I previously worked for IBM in London some years ago, though more recently
was working for them based in Ireland, hence I'm a bit out of the loop
contact and networking wise ;-)
I hope it's not poor protocol to beg on a first post! though it's as good a
way as any of introducing myself. As mentioned if anyone has any
suggestions / advice please feel free to e-mail me or call on mobile. I
have spent all this week putting out CVs to the recruiters I could find,
though feel sure I haven't caught all of them.

Many thanks and best regards

Hi Howard,

I usually don't respond to these messages, as I get enough people who ask me
the same question on a personal level, and I have usually just passed them
on to an agency or an employer I know is looking.

However, at the frustration with some of the Recruiting Agencies, I have
helped set up an agency (I only hold an advisory role - in that I pass on
clients and candidates) with some friends of mine. I feel a bit crass
promoting it here, just as you did asking your question on this forum, so
what I suggest is that if you or anyone is interested in security related
work in the UK, (mostly around London) just drop me an email.

Hey guys, we still have some slots for presentations for the next OWASP
London Chapter event (which will be part of
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Day).

The current plan is for it to be on the 5th of September (Wed) in
Hammersmith

Contact Ivan directly if you can help :)

Message-ID: <46D565E5.7040902@webkreator.com>

The next OWASP London Chapter meeting is going to be held in the
Auriol Kensington Rowing Club on September 5th (Wednesday):

http://www.akrowing.com/page.php?page=findus

This is the same place where the meeting was held in March 2006.
(A very nice venue, if I might add.)

Please arrive between 6.30 and 7pm. We shall begin at 7pm.

Now, I am afraid we haven't done a good job organising this
particular meeting. Between Dinis and myself it wasn't clear who
is doing what and I unfortunately let some things to remain
unresolved for too long. This has led to us not yet having the
agenda for the meeting.

I am determined to have the meeting, though, and I will try to
get some interesting speakers. Personally I would like to debate
what could make the chapter come alive again. What is the missing
ingredient?

I will follow up soon with more information.


Thanks,
Ivan
