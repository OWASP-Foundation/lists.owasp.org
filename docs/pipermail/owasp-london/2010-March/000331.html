<PRE>This is the announcement for the forthcoming full-day OWASP training on OWASP projects and resources. We have two confirmed dates for these courses - on April 16, 2010 and May 28, 2010.  Signup is open for the April session (see links at the bottom of the email). Spaces are limited (only 20 spaces on the April delivery), so first come first served.

Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most OWASP Projects are not widely used and understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of quality and usefulness of those Document &amp; Tool projects, but due to a lack of understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem or in the Web Application Development Life-cycle.
This course aims to change that by providing a selection of mature and enterprise ready projects together with practical examples of how to use them.
The course will be very practical where demonstration and hands-on exercises will be provided for the tools covered.
If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of the course, please bring a laptop.

Please note that this training is free, but is currently open to only OWASP Members. However, if you've been looking for a good reason to join as an OWASP Member its only USD$50 to join for a year (approximately &#163;33 at current exchange rates). 

To sign up for the courses, follow the registration links from here - <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/London/Training/OWASP_projects_and_resources_you_can_use_TODAY">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/London/Training/OWASP_projects_and_resources_you_can_use_TODAY</A>
