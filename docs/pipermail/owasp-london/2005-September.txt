Morning all,

Sorry for the cross posting here, but does anyone have a
reference/template for designing software applications?

Ideally im looking for guidelines on the correct manner in creating the
spec of how you would like an app to be developed

Thanks


Daniel

Is anyone here using DREAD rating's for reporting vulnerability issues yet?

Yes, I do. It works well for technical issues in code developed in  
house, particularly useful at developing a TODO list for future  
fixes. It is not perfect - it takes longer than necessary to work out  
when there are many issues to work through, but I haven't yet come  
across a way as good as STRIDE / DREAD which is *acceptable* to the  
business types who have to fund remediation work as they can work the  
sums just like Excel and for some reason they tend to believe the  
subjective bits of DREAD a bit more than simply putting in "High"  
"Medium" or "Low" based upon one's experience.

However, it is *not* out of the box a business risk modelling tool -  
if you need to factor that in, DREAD is missing the average loss  
expectancy component.

You could change D = damage to be the ALE, and calculate the ALE as  
per normal, with

ARO = Annualized Rate of Occurrence
SLE = Single Loss Expectancy

ARO x SLE = ALE

ARO is very subjective and impossible to garner realistic numbers or  
statistics. I'm not saying make it up, but you might have to. Costing  
the SLE is next to impossible unless you have had that event happen  
in the past. There are many good references on how to incorporate the  
actual cost of a SLE. Make sure you use "opportunity cost" and future  
revenue losses as well - if you lose thousands of people days  
organization wide due to a virus or no backups, that's a real hit to  
the bottom line *and* future activities they were working on.

However, it is my experience, there is a great deal of confusion  
about if the ARO refers to the organization, or globally. For  
example, an organization will receive hundreds if not hundreds of  
thousands of viruses per year. It's easy to use this as the ARO and  
no one will disagree. But what about more esoteric items, such as  
phishing or DDoS attacks. Until you've lost money, you could easily  
set ARO to zero. Yet, there are millions of phishing victims and  
thousands of DDoS victims every year, and once a phishing or DDoS  
attack starts against you, they rarely if ever stop.

That's why we rate the ARO of a building fire in any particular  
building as a 1 in 10 year event as it is averaged out over a bunch  
of buildings, even if you don't own or occupy more than one. You have  
to have fire exits and evacuation plans ... even if you never intend  
to have a fire. Unless a risk is unique to the organization, I always  
take the global ARO, not the local / organization ARO.

Communicating this successfully to business types is very very hard.

thanks
Andrew

I have used DREAD in the past in Application Security Audit reports 
since it allowed me to present objective reasons why I would rate an 
issue High, and another issue Low

It also allows for more focused discussions

I'm doing the following presentation on the next DDD conference 
(http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/default.asp) in Reading (UK)

*"Attacking Web and Windows Applications*
In this session multiple attack vectors will be shown covering a wide 
variety of vulnerabilities and exploits: Sql Injection (basic and 
advanced), XSS (session hijacking and remote command execution), 
Elevation of Privilege, Web Services exploitation, AJAX exploitation, 
Rootkits (user and kernel level), attacking fat-clients by hooking into 
windows functions (and patching applications in real time), dynamically 
manipulating .Net client applications, exploiting buffer overflows, 
exploiting IE vulnerabilities, exploiting Full Trust Asp.Net, attacking 
IIS, and,  using MetaSploit to automate attacks (and exploit generation)."

Hi all,

I attended a ISSA UK (London Chapter) event last Thursday, where amongst the
speakers were Howard Schmidt, Whitt Diffie (of Diffie-Hellman algorithm
fame), and Ed Gibson (the newly appointed Microsoft Security Spokesperson
and ex-FBI agent), and would definitely recommend hearing Howard Schmidt,
and I aim to go on the 5th October as well. One can assume that Ed Gibson
will be there as well, and if you have never met an ex-FBI agent (lets face
it most of us haven't, let alone have the opportunity to meet a White House
advisor) it may be your only chance.

Sounds like it will be a great session.

[P.S. I'm not on the ISSA London Chapter Committee, so this isn't an advert
on their behalf, but, last weeks meeting and all ISSA London meetings are
free to attend, and they are held in London with excellent speakers always,
check out the web site for future events on: http://www.issa-uk.org ]

Hi all,

Thought you might be interested in attending this one:

Microsoft Developer Security Event with Top Independent Security Expert
Howard Schmidt

This is your chance to meet top security expert Howard Schmidt and attend an
evening event that will give you a valuable overview of developer security
in the UK and the Trustworthy Computing Initiative.
Howard has a wealth of experience in this field from his time at eBay,
Microsoft, US White House and US Air Force and will provide his perspective
on what we must do now and in the long term to provide secure software
assurance.

But discussion is better than listening =96 so arm yourself with your key
developer security questions and ask our expert panel.  The last hour will
be dedicated to your questions, with the panel of Howard Schmidt, Microsoft,
and Security partner SPI Dynamics and we'll be collecting questions on the
night.

Want to learn more about Howard Schmidt's background?  View his biography

Hi all,

Before summer, during and even up to a few weeks ago there were attempts to
organise a London meeting for September, it looks like that wont happen now,
can we come up with some suggested dates for October and future?

I would like to suggest that we have a regular day of the week and a regular
cycle of meetings whether its each month (apart from the usual holiday
months) every other month or every quarter. My suggestion for the regular
day be a Tuesday or Wednesday (no preference to 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th week in
the month) of each cycle.

Any thoughts, suggestions or comments?

Regards
Sarb Sembhi

Hi all,

I've started to realize that i just dont have enough time to manage  
all the various projects im working in, and organize the London side  
of things.
Would anyone be willing to jump up and take control for me?
