<PRE>I'm happy to put some effort in, and I can put a face on it if need be.

To inspire secure software I think we need to inspire thoroughly correct software. When software does exactly what it says on the tin, with no unexpected behaviours, it also happens to be secure. Developers don't write software that doesn't do stuff. They write software that does stuff. They must be told how to do the job well.

If I had to pick 3 points, one of them would be from the test-driven development camp. Basically provoking every developer who says her software/module/function does X to provide some reason (e.g., a unit test, integration test, etc.) for believing it. In this high tech world, we are entirely too prone to believe things work, without applying a healthy filter of skepticism. Children are brought up amongst technology that looks like magic to OAPs. They see it work over and over and don't develop the skepticism that they should. They should be taught that software fails, hardware fails, and people make mistakes. Testing while developing is vital for catching problems before they grow into larger issues. I will bet that many learning computer science today struggle to write a clear test case that tests exactly what they need to test, and nothing else.

My &#163;0.02,
Paco

Thanks for all the great ideas.  I wonder if we could put together a
short letter, with say three key appsec recommendations, and send it
to the minister?

Would anyone be willing to front this?

The offensive security course does a good job for it's scope. Why not use that as a template format for security courses/training.

The question is not Dull or Smart, it is about making IT creative.

There is probably a need for a short section on personal IT security,
probably the equivalent for safe sex in biology.   Trying to teach kids
about industrial strength security  would fall in to the Dull catagory.

Presenting security as a &quot;who-dunnit&quot; story might make it more attractive
and their spark imagination.  Relate it to what they see in the media -
Lizbeth Salander or Spooks.

We have to give security the same &quot;cool&quot; as writing video games

So as we start to think about who engage to support these initiatives,
remember Marsh McLuhan, the medium is the message.

Hi

I guess most of you know or heard about the ICT curriculum issues e.g.

 'Dull' computer classes beefed up **
 The education secretary has announced a replacement for &quot;harmful and
dull&quot; ICT classes in England's schools, which he says will better equip
pupils for the 21st Century.
 &lt; <A HREF="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-16493929">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-16493929</A> &gt;

Does anyone have time to pass on some thoughts to the relevant authorities
on building security into the school curriculum?  Hands up please...

Maybe we could engage with some other organisations about this such as
GetSafeOnline and SSDRI?
