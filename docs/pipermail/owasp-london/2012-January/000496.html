<PRE>Long time listener, first time caller. Sadly I find TDD and security engineering almost culturally at odds with each other. 

Tests are written to ensure correctness, in relation to the correct cases that you can think of. Tests fall from the user stories or requirements (however expressed), like &quot;we must send the users email. We must capture a users email address&quot; the almost wholesale problem with that is that very rarely is there a user story which expresses the security aspect in user stories, because users dont express them. They don't think like that. This is further compounded by the fact that TDD is about tests to make sure software does what you want it to do, not what you don't. In reality we want the developer to have a typically defensive stance when writing code,  TDD doesn't do that. 

Sorry Paco, I'm not saying this just because it's you :)

Having just done a recent round of graduate recruitment I was surprised at the quality of candidates. For those who've been formerly taught things, and paid good money to do so, I very much doubt that at a level they would be able to effectively manage security concerns along with just being able to write enough code to solve the problem. I think a general ethos of interacting and writing secure code is important it needs recurrent reenforcement.  

As you say some computer scientists seem to have difficulty in describing OO concepts like polymorphism and encapsulation, and linked lists from arrays and don't even know what a hash based data structure is.  After highlighting they've been taught it! If you are overloaded (hehe) by that then I question the value of teaching testing.

You are right about testings importance but TDD in my experience doesn't lend itself to these kinds of tests.  From ethos perspective I think you're correct though

</I>&gt;<i> To inspire secure software I think we need to inspire thoroughly correct software. When software does exactly what it says on the tin, with no unexpected behaviours, it also happens to be secure. Developers don't write software that doesn't do stuff. They write software that does stuff. They must be told how to do the job well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I had to pick 3 points, one of them would be from the test-driven development camp. Basically provoking every developer who says her software/module/function does X to provide some reason (e.g., a unit test, integration test, etc.) for believing it. In this high tech world, we are entirely too prone to believe things work, without applying a healthy filter of skepticism. Children are brought up amongst technology that looks like magic to OAPs. They see it work over and over and don't develop the skepticism that they should. They should be taught that software fails, hardware fails, and people make mistakes. Testing while developing is vital for catching problems before they grow into larger issues. I will bet that many learning computer science today struggle to write a clear test case that tests exactly what they need to test, and nothing else.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all the great ideas.  I wonder if we could put together a
</I>&gt;<i> short letter, with say three key appsec recommendations, and send it

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would anyone be willing to front this?

</I>&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess most of you know or heard about the ICT curriculum issues e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 'Dull' computer classes beefed up **
</I>&gt;<i> The education secretary has announced a replacement for &quot;harmful and
</I>&gt;<i> dull&quot; ICT classes in England's schools, which he says will better equip
</I>&gt;<i> pupils for the 21st Century.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have time to pass on some thoughts to the relevant authorities
</I>&gt;<i> on building security into the school curriculum?  Hands up please...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we could engage with some other organisations about this such as
</I>&gt;<i> GetSafeOnline and SSDRI?
