<PRE>Hi Max! Glad to pique your interest. :)

I changed the subject hoping that others would forgive the tangent off
into testing land.

In the world of testing, there are two kinds of activities: checking and
testing. There are substantial differences between the two activities.
&gt;<i>From the outside the two are often incorrectly confused with each other.
</I>
&quot;Checking&quot; is exactly what you describe. Does the software do what it is
supposed to do? This activity can be (and sometimes is) done by
mouth-breathing mouse clickers. That sort of activity is often done by
humans for the sake of expediency, but could be done perfectly well by
computers if we had the right framework / harness / programmers, etc.

&quot;Testing&quot; on the other hand is more exploratory. That does not mean ad
hoc, unplanned, random, or unpredictable. But it means interacting with
the software outside its normal parameters. Michael Bolton (no, not the
no-talent ass-clown[1]) has a good blog about this:
<A HREF="http://www.developsense.com/blog/2009/08/testing-vs-checking/">http://www.developsense.com/blog/2009/08/testing-vs-checking/</A>

Because so many organisations put so little funding or effort into their
quality assurance / testing / whatever phases, most developers experience
testing as a pretty pathetic bunch of losers performing rote checks
against an app. They have no hope of turning up an interesting issue, and
when they do, they're unable to explain it. That has nothing to do with
the discipline of software quality as a whole. To look at the crappy PHP
being flung all over the web and use it to make statements about software
development generally would be a similar misunderstanding.

So I agree test-driven development is low value if the only thing the
development-written checks do is check correct behaviour. They must test
negative conditions, too. That's not a failure of theory, it's a failure
of practice. As we know: In theory, theory and practice are the same. In
practice, they're not.

Cheers,
Paco

&gt;<i>Tests are written to ensure correctness, in relation to the correct cases
</I>&gt;<i>that you can think of. Tests fall from the user stories or requirements
</I>&gt;<i>(however expressed), like &quot;we must send the users email.
