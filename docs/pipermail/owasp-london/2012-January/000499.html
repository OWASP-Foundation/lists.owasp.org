This is interesting because I have never seen a security test of any 
value that didn't also ensure correctness, in fact 'correct behaviour' 
is a prerequisite to understanding failure!

Funny isn't it! They do the 'correctness testing' but they fail to write 
the rest of the quality checks - why is that do you suppose? Could it be 
that it is because they think it is 'the securities people's job'?

When a user logs in and types their password is that a security test or 
a functional test? What about password resets? What about account 
lockout - most of those are functional requirements in most 
applications&#8230;

</I>
But it very, very easily could - take a very close look at the OWASP O2 
project; it even has cucumber built in so you can write gherkin security 
tests&#8230; The fact is the next generation of testers are going to have to 
provide security and functionality testing.

&gt;<i> Sorry Paco, I'm not saying this just because it's you :)
</I>
The point is that maybe TDD is being done wrong; not that TDD is wrong. 
Agile was intended to free people from dogma - but it has instead become 
a dogma of its own! People are doing the actions of agile, but they are 
not at all agile - you are not alone in your observation of this. 
However, that doesn't make agile broken; rather it says a great deal 
more about the people practising it.
