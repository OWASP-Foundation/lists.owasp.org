Hello,
I have a serious question and would really appreciate your advice.

Currently I am a student at the University of Hertfordshire, on a BSc
Computer Science course.  In September I will be entering my final
year project and I am trying to come up with a great idea for a
project/dissertation!!

So at DDD3 I saw the attacking web apps session (done by Dinis) and
thought how cool it was, and how much I wasn't appear of (knew about
buffer overflows, and sql injection etc but still a lot I was not
fully aware of).  Very cool session, thank you (if your reading this)

So I thought it would be a great idea to have a tool like what FXCop
for design guidelines is but for the security guidelines focusing on
C# / ASP.net (with bonus/advance/if I have time features being vb.net
and winforms).

The reason for this is because, I feel most developers aren't aware of
the issues or feel that security isn't an issue for there applications
(where I am currently on placement, I get the impression we don't mind
about application security because we have good system security and we
trust our employees ? I don't like this idea) so I would love a tool
which could integrate into VS2005 and scan your code for potential
security issues (at compile time), and maybe do runtime checking as
well ? meaning developers wouldn't have to be full security gurus to
have more secure code.

Plus it means I get chance to fully read Writing Secure Code (Second
Edition) and other cool security books which I have been wanted to do
for a while

What I would like from you is a bit more information about security
from a high level point of view.  Is security in ASP.net 2.0 a big
issue? How secure is it out of the box?  More generally how important
is security in the .net world? I know C++ has issues, but I am not
sure about C#.

Finally ? do you think the tool would work and be successful?  Is
there anything else you could think of?

I would really like your thoughts on this, and some advice on my idea.

Thank you for your time.

Hello Ben

Would you be releasing this tool under an Open Source Licence (and / or via Owasp)?

Hi Dinis,

I haven't actually thought about how I would release the tool (what
licences etc) - still trying to decide if it is do-able. If I did do
this I wouldn't be charging people for the software (i'll leave that
to the larger companies) and I would like to make it extendable in
some way (either custom rules and/or completely open source depending
on time and project guidance).

Why do you ask?

Cheers

Ben

Hi Ben,

RE: tools that integrate with VS2005, source code/runtime checking. Take 
a look at SPIdynamics Webinspect/Devinspect. It's commercial (I am in no 
way affiliated with SPIDynamics), it may give you some ideas.
