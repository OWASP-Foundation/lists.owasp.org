Subject: [Owasp-london] GDPR Patterns and Summit working sessions (tomorrow)
Message-ID: <CA+f=kXDdqrTejiF8fbKu2pSykrq=r1wJCuGX_CSGbiDnjcCpiA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Owasp London

Tomorrow we going to host another evening of Working Sessions at the
Photobox offices in central London (you can register here
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-working-session-tickets-42422014387 ).

This week we are going to continue the great work started on the *GDPR
Patterns* (
https://open-security-summit.org/working-sessions/pre-summit/gdpr-patterns/)
and we are going to continue to improve the Working Sessions objectives for
the next Summit (https://open-security-summit.org/working-sessions/)

Regarding the next Summit (4th-8th of June), it is really taking off, with
lots of great content and sessions (see full list of Tracks, Working
Sessions and User Sessions at https://open-security-summit.org). If you
have specific topics you are interested in, now is the right time to create
a session around it.

Here is a quick presentation about the Summit:
https://www.slideshare.net/DinisCruz/open-security-summit-april-2018

Here are two great blog posts from of last year's Summit:

 - "The OWASP Summit exceeded all expectations"
https://www.continuumsecurity.net/owasp-summit-exceeded-expectations/

 - "OWASP Summit 2017: what's new?"
http://blog.mindedsecurity.com/2017/06/owasp-summit-2017-whats-new.html

If you are on Owasp Slack please join the the #open-security-summit channel
(if you are not, you can register here https://owasp.herokuapp.com/ )

Finally, you might find this presentation I delivered last week
interesting: *"Using security to drive chaos engineering"*
https://www.slideshare.net/DinisCruz/using-security-to-drive-chaos-engineering-april-2018-93774652
(would love to get some feedback on those ideas)

Thanks for your help
