<PRE>This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to be
held on January 14th, at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between
6pm-6:30pm).

We're at a new location this time, at Nomura who have kindly agreed to let
us use their facilities:

- Nomura, Nomura House, 1 St Martins-le-Grand, London EC1A 4NP

Should be easier to find this time - this is near to St Pauls in the City,
and Google Maps etc should be more accurate this time around for showing you
where it is.

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should
have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well
and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at
<A HREF="http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.">http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.</A> Note, please enter your real name, as
this will be given to Nomura building security. If you don't RSVP, you may
not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close midday the day of
the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in
advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">justin.clarke at owasp.org</A> so your space can be released for someone else.

==Talks==

* Top Ten Deployment Mistakes That Render SSL Useless - Ivan Ristic

SSL is the technology that secures the Internet, but it only works when
properly configured. Unfortunately, because SSL is assumed to be easy to use
(and it genuinely is), there is a lack of information how to use it
properly. As a result, too many web sites use insecure deployment practices
that render SSL completely useless. In this talk I will present a list of
top ten (or thereabout) deployment mistakes, based on my work on the SSL
Labs assessment platform.

* Note: I am also in the process of confirming the second talk/slot in this
evening, so this will be updated on the site and on further announcements.

==Speakers==

Ivan Ristic is a respected security expert and book author, known especially
for his contribution to the web application firewall field and the
development of ModSecurity, an open source web application firewall. He is
the author of Apache Security, a comprehensive security guide for the Apache
web server. A frequent speaker at computer security conferences, Ivan is an
active participant in the application security community, member of the Open
Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and officer of the Web Application
Security Consortium (WASC).

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the
chapter page ( <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London</A> ).

See you there!

Justin Clarke
