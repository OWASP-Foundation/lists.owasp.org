Subject: [Owasp-london] Call for venues - July OWASP meeting
Message-ID: <25EDEB63-56CB-42BE-88C9-0C69CEAC30A2@owasp.org>

Hi all,

We haven't got a secured space for our July OWASP meeting as of yet, so I'd like to put out a call for venues for our July OWASP meeting.  The dates we're targeting are the following:
- July 1
- July 8 - this would be the preferred date if possible
- July 15
- July 22
- July 29

If not, we will look to secure an alternative venue, but if any of you have meeting space for 30-40 people from 6pm-9pm on any of these dates, we'd appreciate it :-)

Best regards

Justin

Hi Folks,

I have just joined this mail list. 

I was working with the head of the Scotland branch of OWASP - Rory McCune - a few months ago and
suggested I go along to your next meeting as I am in London.

(My background is Microsoft based web, security, architecture and server side of things)

I have never been to one before and not sure what to expect.

The first question is can I just turn up or do I have to be a fully paid up member of the OWASP?

Second question what date and times is it (work hours, after work, 1 hour or a full day session)?

Sorry if these are basic question but I didn't find any obvious answers.

Cheers,

John

Which reminds me, has a venue been established and a date agreed on for the
July meet?

Kind regards,

Hi John,

You just turn up - these are free and open to everyone.

We're in the process of trying to lock down dates and venues for the remainder of the year, but if you're on the list you'll get all the details when these are announced.

Best regards

Not yet - we're looking into a few different options.

Thanks for the prompt reply.

Do I need to book a day off work for these meetings or is it out of hours?

John
