Subject: [Owasp-london] OWASP London is looking for Hackathon space &
	sponsors
Message-ID: <36cb1b04-5ee5-5993-f138-b95222fb0d6c@owasp.org>

All,

OWASP London is planning to run a hackathon (Capture The Flag event for 
application developers) in November and we are looking for a venue and a 
hosting sponsor.

What we are looking to do is over the span of two evenings:

     Evening 1:  6pm-10pm: Intro + Secure Development Workshop.
     Evening 2:  6pm-10pm: The Hackathon (Capture The Flag competition).

We are flexible on the dates.

The event will be for around 75-100 participants and we would need 
facilities to support that many people:

  - seating (cafe-style tables or desks)
  - power sockets
  - fast Wifi
  - large screen/projector
  - microphone/speakers
  - catering/snacks/tea/coffee/biscuits

Ideally the venue should be in Central London (Zone 1).

The event would be free to attend to registered participants.

We are looking for a sponsor who can host this event or a sponsor who 
can cover the costs of hiring a suitable venue for two evenings.

We have identified several hackathon spaces in Central London and 
approached them however the quotes we got are quite steep (in the region 
of ?2000-?3500 for two evenings).

Please get in touch with us if you can help with hosting or sponsoring 
this event.
