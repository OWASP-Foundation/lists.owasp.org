<PRE>Hello, here is an updated version of this Thursdays Owasp Meeting in London (now with final address details, a change of running order and other goodies like free books and PodCast)

-------------

On March 9th 2006, Thursday, there will be another Owasp-London Chapter gathering in the Hammersmith 's Auriol Kensington Rowing Club, 4 Lower Mall, Hammersmith, London, W6 9DJ.

Here are pictures of the club's venue <A HREF="http://www.akrowing.com/rebuild_gall.php?race=venue&amp;pic=1,">http://www.akrowing.com/rebuild_gall.php?race=venue&amp;pic=1,</A> here are detailed instructions to how to get there <A HREF="http://www.akrowing.com/page.php?page=findus">http://www.akrowing.com/page.php?page=findus</A> (specially important for the ones that will come by tube (Auriol Kensington is between two pubs the Blue Anchor and The Rutland )) and if you are driving you might find this google map useful <A HREF="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=W6+9DJ&amp;ll=51.489935,-0.231056&amp;spn=0.047885,0.21698">http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=W6+9DJ&amp;ll=51.489935,-0.231056&amp;spn=0.047885,0.21698</A>

In this session, I am very happy to announce that Owasp founder Mark Curphey will deliver a presentation on the night's topic &quot;Naked Application Security - A striped back look at the industry today&quot;. I (Dinis Cruz) will also deliver a presentation on the latest developments at Owasp, the forthcoming European Owasp Conference, and the new Owasp tools SiteGenerator and VulnReport.

So, currently the schedule looks like this:

6:00 pm - Arrive at location, get some beers and food
<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">dinis.cruz at owasp.net</A>) if you are planning in
attending so that I have an idea of the numbers.

Best regards

8:30 pm - Dinis Cruz presentation &quot;Latest developments at Owasp, the forthcoming European Owasp Conference, and the new Owasp tools SiteGenerator and VulnReport&quot; 
 9:00 pm - Roundtable discussion about Mark's presentation and &quot;What next? How to turn the boat to the right direction?&quot;

The presentations will occour on the top floor (of Auriol Kensington Rowing Club) and there is a bar on the floor below (and two pubs within 50 meters where you can get food) so the basics are covered.

Mark will be giving away several copies of the new Mike Andrews (James Whittaker)  How to Break Web Software: Functional and Security Testing of Web Applications and Web Services.

We will also be recording the presentations and releasing them as PodCasts earlier next week.
