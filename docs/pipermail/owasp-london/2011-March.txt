Hi there,

Here is the second challenge to win a free entrance ticket to AppSec EU

the word successfully, or how many of the letters in your word match the
computer's word. Keep on submitting five letter words until you have guessed
the computer's word.
In order to win an free ticket to AppSec EU 2011 you need to hack the game &
database of Jotto.

Once you solve the exercises, please send us an email to ireland at owasp.org with
your full name and details on how you accomplished this goal.

The first one who solves these exercises gets a free ticket to OWASP AppSec
EU 2011!

Please visit http://www.appseceu.org/?page_id=273 to find out further

A big THANKS goes to Mordecai for setting up and customizing the challenge.

Thank you and best of luck everyone!

Hi

Just to resurrect this thread, and the discussion about the ICO's
Technology Reference Panel, today I met the person the ICO appointed
as "Principal Policy Adviser (Technology)" at an ICO seminar on data
anonymisation.

I floated the idea of OWASP contacting him, and he seemed keen to
engage.  So if anyone wants to pick this up.... I can provide an
introduction.  It would be worth asking for involvement from the
Leeds/North and Scotland chapters too.

Regards

Colin Watson

Any volunteers who like to step up on behalf of OWASP UK? Needless to say, having a background in both OWASP and ICO would be handy for this.

I wouldn't mind - but I am a bit uninformed about the ICO... :-)
And what is it that we would like OWASP to promote in terms of Policy?
