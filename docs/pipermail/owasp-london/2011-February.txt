Subject: [Owasp-london] Special OWASP London event - February 17th at 7pm -
	Securing the Web with SSL (in conjunction with London Geek Nights)
Message-ID: <D66D66C4-09AC-453F-BA7F-A358CB5826F7@owasp.org>

Another something different - in conjunction with London Geek Nights.

As part of OWASP working with developer focused groups, and making sure we cross-pollinate with some of the other interesting and cool groups in London, I've arranged an evening on SSL as a general topic with the folks from Geek Nights.  This is our chance to have some real discussions about the practical usages of SSL with folks who're developing and running real applications, and grab a few beers after with a few new folks.

Due to this being run in conjunction, signup will be on London Geek Nights site - http://londongeeknights.wetpaint.com/page/Securing+the+Web+with+SSL 

See you all there!

Apologies if this isn't the right forum for this discussion but I'm hoping this group can help..

We have a very large website which processes payment card details (hence falls under PCI) and are getting a push from our compliance teams to run rescans every time we make a code change.

This is very infeasible as a full set of scans takes weeks to run and the bulk of our code changes are very unlikely to cause vulnerabilities.

I am trying to come up with some sensible guidance around when a scan is needed on our Java code. My first suggestions is as follows:-

- Convert the list of classes / packages listed in the Java/J2EE section of http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_Table_of_Contents into a set of PMD / FindBugs rules. This would be run against the modified code to see if it generates any "warnings".

I had a quick google to see if anyone had done this before and couldn't find anything so am asking whether..

a) this sounds like a good plan (and if so I could donate it to OWASP for others to use)

b) are there any other alternatives? OWASP Orizon sounds great but can't seem to find some documentation to explain it in detail / try it out..

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide

Are they aware that this would exceed what is required to maintain
conformance to PCI DSS i.e.
https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/infosupp_6_6_applicationfirewalls_codereviews.pdf

A SaaS/cloud offering might be suitable then, such as
http://www.veracode.com/ or
https://www.fortify.com/products/fortify-on-demand/index.html

Since PCI DSS references the OWASP Top Ten then
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Quote-Veracode_Provides_Visibility_into_Their_Verification_Process_for_the_OWASP_Top_10
might be your preferred solution.

Justin Clarke could also assist with Fortify - I highly recommend GDS.

Furthermore, I would recommend selecting a different SAST/DAST vendor
each time for coverage.

I would recommend integrating PMD, FindBugs, etc as part of your
automated build process anyway prior to submitting it to an external
review to reduce the cost of remediation.

Also, as a majority of the OWASP Top Ten is related Input (and Output)
Validation then refactoring (similar to a major release) of these Java

Hi Mandy,

>From a PCI DSS *compliance* point of view, you could also consider Option 2 of 6.6, which states that you can use a Web Application Firewall.  Obviously this does not remove the need for vulnerability assessment of your web app, but it may enable you to reduce the frequency of scanning and satisfy your compliance teams.  You would clearly need to take a risk-based approach to work out whether this made sense in your organisation.

Cheers,

Tim

We have a very large website which processes payment card details (hence falls under PCI) and are getting a push from our compliance teams to run rescans every time we make a code change.

I agree with the others that this is beyond what's called for to be compliant, but it's it shouldn't be infeasible.

This is very infeasible as a full set of scans takes weeks to run and the bulk of our code changes are very unlikely to cause vulnerabilities.

I'm surprised it takes weeks. That sounds more like broken process than anything else. For most applications, even the really big ones, you can get to a state where rescans are not so onerous. I've done dozens of apps including plenty of multi-million line systems and even if the first scan (for a baseline) takes a couple weeks on-site, we get subsequent scans down to something far less.

In all the commercial code scanners, it's possible to build up filters and custom rule sets that speed up your scans and optimise it for what what's relevant, while at the same time performing incremental scans of just the code that has changed (as opposed to rescanning the entire app from start to finish every time). Rather than build up an extra process around scanning, I'd just look to optimise the process you have and try to get the tools to produce a more reasonable output in a more reasonable time. Combine that optimisation with a middle ground compromise with the compliance people. Rescan for each major release? Each minor release? There ought to be some milestone with enough frequency to keep them happy without driving you nuts.

Regards,
Paco

there is really no answer to this. we could discuss it for ages. i
think what is most important is defining a criteria and actioning it.
and make sure it's adhered to.

we could discuss best practice until we're blue in the face. define
what's best and stick with it.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to my post.

I perhaps didn't make it clear that I work as a Java developer and my main interest at the moment is static analysis of source code for potential security flaws (we have separate teams who manage the vulnernability scanning process)  so as a result of everyone's reply I'll be checking out:-

- Fortify (Source Code Analyzer) 
- Orizon

and reading this book: http://www.amazon.com/Secure-Programming-Static-Analysis-Brian/dp/0321424778

Thanks again!

Mandy

I have done some more digging and
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Source_Code_Review_OWASP_Projects_Project
might be of interest

Also, Fortify/HP do offer their "On Demand" service to OWASP i.e.
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Open_Review_Project_owasp.fortify.com_FAQ
and some of the OWASP Project Leaders who have implemented this might
be able to provide you a reference.

Hi Mandy,

Couple of notes :-

We've had a client go the PMD route and had us write rules to
implement their secure coding guidelines, so that approach is doable.
Depending on your development process, I'd look to implement
guidelines rather than the code review guide as a practical step
(otherwise may be more than can be done practically). As you noted,
Fortify (now HP) is an option to make this easier - I'd also look at
IBM (Rational AppScan Source Edition) and Veracode as well to have a
look at the main options, if you're going down the commercial route.

The other note is that we had a lot of discussion at the OWASP Summit
last week about OWASP being more useful to developers and business in
general. Although this is certainly a complex and multifaceted
question all on it's own, I'd be interested in how we can be more
useful to folks like yourself, and to non-banking organisations like
BA. For example - what could OWASP provide that would justify BA
joining up as a corporate member? Perhaps if you have any ideas and
frustrations that would be something that fit in the OWASP sphere, let
me know and I'll set up a call to capture these and feed back into the
post Summit feedback?

best regards

Justin

Hi all,

For those who are interested, Open Source pioneer Dr Richard M. Stallman is going to be delivering a number of talks in the UK in early March. He's delivering a talk "A Free Digital Society" at the Institute of Engineering and Technology in London on March the 7th. Admittance is free - sign up here - http://www.theiet.org/local/uk/london/central-Mar2011.cfm

For those of us outside of London, Dr Stallman is delivering talks in a number of other locations around the same time - check out his travel schedule here - http://www.fsf.org/events/rms-speeches.html

Hi all,

For those of you who don't attend DC4420, their next meeting is going to be Tuesday the 22nd of February at The Phoenix on Cavendish Square - see http://www.dc4420.org for details.

This is significant for OWASP in that I am looking for a permanent home for our OWASP meetings, and Alien assures me this is an excellent venue. So, come along and check it out and let me know!

Best regards
