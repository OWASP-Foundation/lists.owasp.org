Hi all, hi Colin,

sorry, I couldn't make it to the meetup on Feb-5.

But since Colin's first presentation of Cornucopia, I was wondering
whether maybe a few of you would like to just try it out, playing it on
an evening based on any sample application (either from one of the
group, or something general like internet banking, ebay, paypal,
facebook). Could be fun and very interesting.

For example would some people like to play it on Feb-25 in the evening
(like from 18:30-21:30)?
Either reply here or via email to me directly.
If we get enough interest, we can organise a normal meeting room and get
some pizza and get the game going. ;-)

Would love to try it out and play it.

Just a thought, Tobias

I like the idea. The participants on the 5th were not development or
infosec folk, but instead gamifiers, so the sort of feedback was quite
different. It would be good to play directly with some other appsec
folk.

There is a Open SAMM project conference call in the evening of the
25th already, so I wonder if we might plan another date, maybe some
time in March (not 8th-15th), if others are interested?

Colin

hi there,

I like this idea of AppSec gamification :-)

Why not organise an evening with activities to promote OWASP games like
Cornucopia, Security Shepherd CTF, etc?

It could be a great way to promote the Appsec conference in June.

Fabio

All,

Our next chapter meeting is coming up in a month (March 20th), so now is a good time to ask if any of you would like to throw your hat in the ring to talk, or whether you?d like to nominate anyone you?d like me to invite to speak?

Best regards

Hi Colin and all,

thanks a lot for your feedback.
It would be an honour and very valuable to have the master of the game
with us.
As you are busy on Tuesday, I will try to organise a room for Thursday
(March-6) evening next week.

@all: Once I have confirmed with Colin and found the room, hopefully
within a day or two, I will send out a proper meeting invite and RSVP.

Sorry that I have to cancel the game this Tuesday evening.

Cheers and see you soon, Tobias

Hi all,

ok, we finally made it:

*We are on for a game of OWASP Cornucopia in London!**
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia
*
We organised a table to play Cornucopia on March 3rd 19:00 at the The
Slaughtered Lamb pub (what a name ;-) ). 

Pop Up Cornucopia in Clerkenwell
*Date & Time:**Monday 3rd March at 19:00 hrs**
*Venue: At The Slaughtered Lamb, 34-35 Great Sutton Street, London EC1V 0DX
(Nearest underground station: Farringdon)

Just show up at 7pm.
If you can, RSVP via email to me (tobias.gondrom at owasp.org) would be
nice, so we have a rough idea how many people are coming. Imagine if the
whole OWASP London chapter would descend on a pub unannounced.... - the
pub might get "slaughtered"...

Evening is of course free, but you will have to buy your own beer.

And we have as special guest Colin, the designer of this OWASP game
joining us. :-)

Timeline:
*Start: 19:00*
after everyone got their drinks etc. we start with a 10 minute intro
into the rules of the game
and then we just have fun with Cornucopia security card game

*Winner: *the winner gets a free card deck of Cornucopia and an OWASP
bag (if we have more than one winner, we let the coin decide)!

And of course everybody gains *a lot of fun and security knowledge,
enjoying a beer with OWASP folks. ;-) *

Looking forward to seeing you next Monday.

Cheers, Tobias

Will try to make this one (will be my first OWASP meet) - however I'm a little worried as I'm sure that's the name of the pub in 'American Werewolf In London??

Will try to make this one (will be my first OWASP meet) - however I'm a little worried as I'm sure that's the name of the pub in 'American Werewolf In London??

Hi all, 



ok, we finally made it: 



We are on for a game of OWASP Cornucopia in London!

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia



We organised a table to play Cornucopia on March 3rd 19:00 at the
The Slaughtered Lamb pub (what a name ;-) ).  



Pop Up Cornucopia in Clerkenwell

Date & Time: Monday 3rd March at 19:00 hrs

Venue: At The Slaughtered Lamb, 34-35 Great Sutton Street,
London EC1V 0DX

(Nearest underground station: Farringdon) 



Just show up at 7pm. 

If you can, RSVP via email to me (tobias.gondrom at owasp.org) would be
nice, so we have a rough idea how many people are coming. Imagine if
the whole OWASP London chapter would descend on a pub
unannounced.... - the pub might get "slaughtered"... 



Evening is of course free, but you will have to buy your own beer. 



And we have as special guest Colin, the designer of this OWASP game
joining us. :-) 



Timeline: 

Start: 19:00

after everyone got their drinks etc. we start with a 10 minute intro
into the rules of the game

and then we just have fun with Cornucopia security card game



Winner: the winner gets a free card deck of Cornucopia and
an OWASP bag (if we have more than one winner, we let the coin
decide)! 



And of course everybody gains a lot of fun and security
knowledge, enjoying a beer with OWASP folks. ;-) 



Looking forward to seeing you next Monday. 



Cheers, Tobias
