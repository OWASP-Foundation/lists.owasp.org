<PRE>Dates have been confirmed for our next meeting, which is going to
be held on March 12th (Thursday), at the earlier time of 6:30pm (like the
December 4th meeting).

The location is the same as for the previous meeting, at KPMG who have
kindly agreed to sponsor the evening:

     KPMG, 39th Floor, One Canada Sq, E14 5AG

At this point, get this date in your calendars. I am looking for anyone who
is interested in speaking, otherwise I'll go ahead and arrange speakers - if
you're working on something interesting, now is the time to come forward and
talk about it!

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network after the
meeting, and may end up going out for dinner afterwards as happened last
time.

If you are planning to attend please send an email to Hayley Green from
KPMG (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">hayley.green at kpmg.co.uk</A>) and CC me (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">justin at justinclarke.com</A>).

Additional details and schedule for the night will go up on the chapter page
(<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London</A>) and mailing list as details firm
up.

See you there!

Justin Clarke


</PRE>
