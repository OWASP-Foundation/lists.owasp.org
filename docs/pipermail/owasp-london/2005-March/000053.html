<PRE>Half the problem with computer crime units is that they need high profile
/ any cases to prosecute, otherwise they don't get funding, and their
little empires will disappear. Many cases are chosen simply to be warnings
to others.

Conflated with the usual problems of the police forces around the world
(essentially, they cannot afford to pay market rates and the lack of
career paths within them for specialists), it makes it very difficult for
them to retain quality staff.

I feel for Daniel. I hope he gets a judge who is willing to listen to
evidence presented, and will consider Daniel's intent, not actions alleged
by the prosecution.

Is there a possibility of calling expert witnesses? If he can, get a good
lawyer - if he's going to plead anything but guilty, a good lawyer worth
their weight in gold (which is why they charge similar figures of dosh).

Good luck,
Andrew
