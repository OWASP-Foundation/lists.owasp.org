<PRE>Afternoon all,

As some of you may know, i was recently accused of &quot;hacking&quot; into a 
charity website.
Obviously for legal reasons i cannot go into the full detail, but you 
can take my word that this charge is so far from the truth, its 
shocking.

I never did any hacking, of any form, on the website in question and 
wouldn't even dream of it. I actually was giving a donation at the time 
and my concern was with the way the site presented itself and also the 
security of my personal details (address/credit card etc)

Unfortunately the downside of this is that the whole thing has 
destroyed any form of career i had within IT security (but given me 
time to work on OWASP stuff since I'm not able to work in this 
industry, thanks to the fine gentlemen who make up the met computer 
crime unit)

The next London meeting will be in late April, Ivan Ristic has 
gratefully offered to sponsor the event, it will be in the same 
location, but we still need a projector and speakers.
Anyone wanting to speak at the next event, please contact me off the 
list.

Don't always believe what you read in the papers, they only report on 
small aspects of the full truth and even then they seem to balls it up.

Daniel
