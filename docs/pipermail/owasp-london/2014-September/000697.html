Dear CISO colleague,

OWASP is preparing the Global CISO report 2014 and conducting a survey 
among CISOs and senior information security managers in relation to 
application security with the aim of providing you with new insights 
about the state of application security across various industry sectors 
and about new security trends and aligning our efforts to better help 
solving the problems of the future that you face.

The survey shall take only a few minutes of your precious time and by 
completing it you are helping shape the future of Internet and software 
security. At the conclusion of the survey, the aggregated results will

to fighting the causes of software insecurity. We are also a registered 
charity &amp; non-profit in the USA and the EU. See more at
