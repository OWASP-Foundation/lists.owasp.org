Subject: [Owasp-london] OWASP London - Reminder - Training/OWASP Projects
	and resources you can use TODAY - this Friday
Message-ID: <DE8BBD26-164D-41E2-81D9-3F9DF7475DA1@owasp.org>

This is the reminder for the forthcoming full-day OWASP training on OWASP projects and resources. We have the first of these on this Friday April 16, 2010.  Signup is open for the April session (see links at the bottom of the email) and we have 9 spaces remaining (we have 18 OWASP'ers have RSVP'd, plus BA staff who will be attending). RSVP closes Wednesday 3pm, so get signed up now! Please note that this training is free, but is currently open to only OWASP Members. However, if you've been looking for a good reason to join as an OWASP Member its only USD$50 to join for a year (approximately ?33 at current exchange rates). 

Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most OWASP Projects are not widely used and understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of quality and usefulness of those Document & Tool projects, but due to a lack of understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem or in the Web Application Development Life-cycle.
This course aims to change that by providing a selection of mature and enterprise ready projects together with practical examples of how to use them.
The course will be very practical where demonstration and hands-on exercises will be provided for the tools covered.
If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of the course, please bring a laptop.

To sign up for the courses, follow the registration links from here - http://www.owasp.org/index.php/London/Training/OWASP_projects_and_resources_you_can_use_TODAY

Message-ID: <6C718298-93F4-41D7-8AEA-34BD9042DEFB@owasp.org>

Hi All,

Just to update on upcoming events and meetings - next up we have the second of the full day "OWASP Resources you can use TODAY" courses, which will be held at Lloyds Bank Group in South Bank, London. This event replaces the normal May chapter meeting that we'd have, meaning the next chapter meeting will be planned for July.

We are currently planning on the following meetings for the remainder of the year:
- July (8th?)
- September (9th?)
- October (11th?)

We're looking for venues for each of these meetings, as we haven't been able to confirm meeting dates for these as of yet. So, if you can provide space for 30-40 OWASPers to meet on these dates (or another Thursday in that month), please get in touch! 

Best regards

Justin

Hi Justin,

Thanks for your email regarding the upcoming.

For designated planned space might i suggest the Theodore Bullfrog 2 minutes
walk from Bank tube station. The PHPUG meets there monthly and the pub is
highly accommodating with excellent facilities and staff.

http://phplondon.org/wiki/Theodore_Bullfrog

<http://phplondon.org/wiki/Theodore_Bullfrog>please note: the specifications
on that link are out-dated and I'm not sure if many or all still apply but,
I would give them a call and ask for further information.

Hi Justin,

I was also thinking Great Western Studio's might be a good option, but it's
a little out of the way.http://www.greatwesternstudios.com/

<http://www.greatwesternstudios.com/>I'm not advertising either place -
these are just places I know and thought they might make good places to
meet.

If anyone else has options for a regular meeting ground, please share.

Kind regards

I think you meant Charring Cross station ;)

The venue is very nice, and location is very convenient, PHPLondon has its
meetings there on the first Thursday of each month.

The area PHPLondon uses is the upstairs bar, there is a decent enough
projector, and there is WIFI, though nobody has gotten it to work yet ;)

Unless the prices changed, that description is pretty much spot on.

Personally - I would love this, as it would mean that I wouldn't have to
choose between attending one meeting or the other and would simply go to
both, I'm sure OWASP can lure more PHP dev's if the dates stop colliding
(which has happened previously).

Actually I meant Embankment tube not Bank. but, yes Charring Cross is close
too. I think we could talk to the management and get the WIFI working.

Does anyone one else have any suggestions re: venues?
