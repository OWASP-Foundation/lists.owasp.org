* Real Time Application Attack Detection and Response with OWASP AppSensor - Colin Watson

The AppSensor project defines a conceptual framework and methodology that offers prescriptive guidance to implement intrusion detection and automated response into an existing application. The talk will provide an overview why conventional defences do not work, and how application intrusion detection can be used to identify, and respond to, attackers before they are able to find a flaw to exploit. Implementations will be described that have been tested against security scanning tools, manual attackers and how the technique could be used to defend against an application worm.

* Announcing final release of O2 - Dinis Cruz

Colin Watson is chair of OWASP's Global Industry Committee and currently contributing, on behalf of OWASP to ENISA's efforts to develop a common assurance model. He is the technical director and principal consultant at web security consultancy Watson Hall Ltd. He has a particular interest in creating user trust and the relationship between security and usability.

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the chapter page ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London ).

== Talk == 

Title: Security Implications and Solutions for Web Applications based on SOA

Abstract:

The main point of SOA (in this context) is combining systems and applications to make new applications, or a big 'overall' application.

This higher inter-operability does (by default) lower security. For a start, a request originating from a web user might end up at several back end systems, which do not know who or what the request came from.

Each back end system might have no access to the customer data, have a different security models, and serve serveral front end. Each of the above systems could be under different ownership, thus the owners have different concerns and priorities. Also, the basic solution at a technical level include single sign on, or security as a service. This can be costly, give limited coverage and have a performance hit. But is pretty much the only way to do it. The other thing to do (probably in tandem) is strict management, and delegation of authority.

== Presenters ==

John Marmelstein has about 13 years in IT. Most of this in distributed systems and 'Middleware' integration software. Including BEA (now owned by Oracle). Mainly working on Enterprise Java and more recently on Microsoft BizTalk. Various industries, incuding financials, public services, and a fish farm.

Further details and schedule for the night will be available on the chapter page:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Ireland.


3. Facebook Vulnerability: Like Clickjacking 

The Facebook Open Graph Like Button is susceptible to a type of attack known as clickjacking. Basically, if the like button is embedded on the page you?re on, made completely transparent, then an attacker could trick you into Liking something without your discretion. 

More information about this vulnerability here: http://erickerr.com/like-clickjacking 

4. Struts2/XWork remote command execution 

Apache Struts team has announced uploaded but has not released, due to an unreasonably prolonged voting process, the 2.2.0 release of the Struts2 web framework which fixes vulnerability reported back on May 31st 2010. 

http://blog.o0o.nu/2010/07/cve-2010-1870-struts2xwork-remote.html 

5. HTML5, Local Storage, and XSS 

A nice new feature of HTML 5 is local storage. Briefly, this is a client side storage option that can be easily accessed via JavaScript. The benefit of local storage over other client side storage options is that local storage allows more storage space than other options (cookies, flash obj, etc). However, there are a few security considerations that should be evaluated before completely jumping on board with local storage. 

The complete article here: 

http://michael-coates.blogspot.com/2010/07/html5-local-storage-and-xss.html 

6. Spring Framework execution of arbitrary code 

The Spring Framework provides a mechanism to use client provided data to update the properties of an object. This mechanism allows an attacker to modify the properties of the class loader used to load the object (via 'class.classloader'). This can lead to arbitrary command execution since, for example, an attacker can modify the URLs used by the class loader to point to locations controlled by the attacker.

Subject: [Owasp-london] Can OWASP do more for less?
Message-ID: <AANLkTikHehOyq7VKRiSzXMungiu1UYkz=5m3zyuUTmRB@mail.gmail.com>

Can OWASP London suggest any projects we could do cheaper than anyone else?

   http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/newsroom/news_releases/2010/100729-voluntary.aspx

Maybe not building cheaper battleships, but other things?
