Morning all


Well thats the summer done, so i think its time for a OWASP meeting  
surely?
I'm thinking sometime in early Sep, is everyone back from holiday then?

What i do need from everyone is:

- Suitable location replacements (the pub is ok, but we need a place  
that has some form of option to do a proper talk)
- Maybe free wireless?
- Alcoholic beverages or the ability to go somewhere else for them


Obviously this all has to be centrally located and i was thinking  
some of the larger companies could spare a meeting room for a couple  
of hours and then we move on towards a venue to relax/chat/network  
after that?

Hi All,

At the moment I can make any Tuesday in September at all. There are already
odd days here and there that are already booked up in the evenings so
setting a date sooner would be best for me.

Regards
Sarb

Late Sept also good for me.  Also, re accommodation; cant do much at this late stage but depending on the numbers........I can get you a room at my place near St.Pauls/Farrigndon tube stations on the following,
26/29/30 Sept from 1pm for up to 12 people sitting at a table or more if we get rid of some desks.
26 or 28 Sept for up to 20 people - at a round table or again more if you dont need tables.  Let me know ASAP.  Also, plenty of pubs nearby for something afterwards if required.

That sounds good,

In that case the only thing to manage would be ask the people who will 
attend to confirm it before-hand so that you can keep the numbers realistic
