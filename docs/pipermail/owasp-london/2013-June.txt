All, 

The video and most of the slides for the presentations on Monday is up on the EUTour2013 page at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/EUTour2013#London. The remaining presentations will follow when I get them.

Thanks to Tobias Gondrom for recording, editing and uploading all of the video. He managed to record all of the sessions, with the exception of Fabio's session, for which recording failed for some reason.

For the crown in West-London

See below an idea I had today, posted on my
blog<http://blog.diniscruz.com/2013/06/open-library-for-my-raspberrypi-arduino.html>,
 that could help to create the next generation of hackers :)

Drop a comment in there if you are interested to help, know of a good place
to host this, or have more ideas on this topic.

Subject: [Dinis Cruz Blog] 'Open Library' for my RaspberryPi, Arduino,
BeagleBone, Pyhton, CodeClub books and materials on the Chiswick High Road
To: dinis.cruz at owasp.org


Yesterday I '*dropped*' 10 Python books to a friend's kid house with a '*take
a look at these books and pick one that make sense to you*' workflow (they
are trying to use a RaspeberryPI and learn how to code in Python)

Later that day one of the kids asked me *'... can we keep two?..' , *which
is always a good sign :)

This got me thinking that that some of my books (I have lot of them)
deserve to be shared with more kids :)

Maybe I could have them '*somewhere*' on the local Chiswick High Road (West
London) as a kind of '*Public Geek Library*' for kids (and adults).

This could also be a great location to put information about
CodeClub<http://codeclub.org.uk/> and
examples of what I'm creating with the kids that I am teaching every
Wednesday.

Some draft thoughts:

   - At first, it is probably better if the books stay in that location
   - This makes sense to be on a coffee shop, or a bookstore close-to/with
   a coffee shop
   - The logic would be that the kids would stop by (with their parents)
   and read the books for a while (to get some ideas)
   - Maybe if there is a photocopier around, the kids could take some
   copies home
   - Ideally the parents would buy the books that are popular with theirs
   kids
   - Maybe if there is a sponsor, we can just buy the books and let the
   kids take them home (with a note "please return it when you're done"
   - I wonder if we can put a little tracker in the books that would signal
   where the book's are (nice project to do with Arduino/Electronics :) )

 I already have the books I need to kickstart this, so next I just need to
find a location for them

 Any ideas?

Announcement from the AppSec Research folks:

The OWASP AppSec Research 2013 (https://appsec.eu), *the* web application security conference will take place from
20 ? 23 August 2013, Tuesday ? Friday in Hamburg, Germany

Registration has just been opened. Early Bird closes at July 1st, so hurry up!

Here are the outlines of the agenda. The training will be on 20/21 August, the conference 22/23 August 2013.

Awesome trainings

(https://appsec.eu/trainings/). Two days of pre-conference technical training with a focus on builders (PHP, Java, JavaScript), a bit of breaking and defending and satisfying the signs of time: Mobile!
And last but not least: Trainers with outstanding international reputation!

Exciting Conference program highlights (appsec.eu/program/talk-teaser/)

* David Ross (Microsoft): inventor of the XSS filter in IE8+
* Stefano Di Paola ("DOMinator"):  JavaScript libraries (in)security
* Yvan Boily (Mozilla): Application Security Manager @ Mozilla talking about the new security testing framework Minion
* Nick Nikiforakis (University Leuven): Web fingerprinting and privacy
* Taras Ivashchenko (Yandex): Content Security Policy
* Chris Eng (Veracode): Real-World Agile SDLC
* Simon Bennetts (Mozilla/OWASP): What's new in OWASP Zed Attack Proxy
* Dave Wichers (Aspect/OWASP): OWASP Top 10 ? 2013
* Jim Manico (WhiteHat/OWASP): Top 10 Proactive Controls

And last but not leat the HackPra AllStars track (appsec.eu/hackpra-allstars/) with prolific speakers and top-tier researchers in the field of web-security around Mario Heiderich, Gareth Heyes, Michele Orr? etc.

This surely very exciting conference will take place in the surely most exciting and most beautiful city of Germany: Hamburg (https://appsec.eu/about-hamburg/). With river and canal cruises, Europe?s second biggest harbour as part of the city, famous streets for nightlife, a vibrating cultural life, as well as a strong creative and tech industry presence, Hamburg is the ideal location to spur innovative thinking and knowledge sharing at the
AppSec Europe 2013 conference.

OWASP is the foremost web app security organization in the world, with thousands of members globally, including some of the biggest names in the industry. The goals of OWASP are to make web applications safe and to educate users, developers, governments, and business leaders on how to protect vulnerable information and avoid dangerous hacks that can cost millions of Euros to fix.

Message-ID: <3e2f12286e5541fcb9c4ea8845de0982@DBXPR04MB064.eurprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Hi OWASPs,

Apologies for hijacking your mailing list but I am in search of a ModSecurity specialist and I can think of no better place than those contributing to the open-source community.

I'm hiring for a Contract Linux Engineer to work for a super client that are based in the UK. These guys have built a genuine, multi-tenanted cloud application that is delivered using the SaaS model. Currently, the product sits on a MySQL database, running on a Windows platform and is deployed to the company's own datacentres. However, the team is about to migrate to Linux, bring in a host of open-source tools and build an Amazon AWS solution for the new geographical territories which they are moving into (USA & Australia).

The company is making a commitment to open-source security tools e.g. Mod_Sec and software-based Intrusion Detection Systems e.g. Snort. There is also plenty of design work to be done around Network Monitoring (Nagios / Cacti) and orchestration/automation using Chef. However, there is a need for an outright Mod_Sec specialist right now.

Role details:

3-6 month contract
Day-rate: open to suggestion but we have a good budget for other roles
Based: Basingstoke, UK (you must be eligible and able to live and work in the UK)

If you are interested, then please reply with some details about your ModSecurity experience / a recent CV and I'll gladly have a more detailed conversation.

Many thanks,

Matt

Subject: [Owasp-london] The big debate: Are you making the right decisions
 to secure your code?
Message-ID: <C92476919B3AC8488E02394B43A6854A14C0B299@BL2PRD0512MB629.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Dear OWASP Member

With the rising complexity of applications and the increasing threat of security attacks, can security risks be left to the security auditors to tackle on their own? Or does this now belong to the Software Development Teams? In short, are you making the right decisions to ensure the security of your code?

Join us on the evening of 3rd July in London to hear leading industry luminaries grapple with the important issues surrounding this debate. The panel discussion will include some pre-prepared questions plus an opportunity for attendees to test the panel members.

An evening Panel Discussion featuring:

  *   Stephen Bonner, Partner, Information Protection, KPMG
  *   Tim Holman, President of the ISSA UK Chapter
  *   Jan Machacek CTO, Cakesolutions

*         Jolyon Clulow, Director, IT Security - Strategy, Architecture Deutsche Bank

  *   John Jacott, Security Practice Leader, Coverity
  *   Moderated by Paul Fisher Pfanda / ex Editor of SC Magazine
