Subject: [Owasp-london] Looking for a meeting space in Stockley Park (close

Message-ID: <CA+f=kXBXLYr2XU7fah18cq4bX3oSWn97T9MYAK68Ox1vr9wx5g@mail.gmail.com>

I meet today with a security professional that works for a company who
is responsible for their internal security education program, and (in
principle) is ok to present to OWASP the amazing solution that they have
come up internally to educate their 1000s of divisions/teams across the
world.

He works at Stockley Park, so I was thinking that we should organize an
OWASP west-london chapter meeting over there.

All we need is a meeting room (and maybe some pizza) , any offers :)

At this session we should also present the latest research for Moxie on a
solution for SSL (convergence) and David Rice's presentation at last year's
AppSec USA where he makes a really great analogy between 'Pollution and
Security'

Justin,

As Dinis has witheld the name of the presenter and in light of his
claims related to the O=Open of OWASP I have some reservations that
the ulterior motive might be to again attempt to market his employer
i.e. Security Innovation.

I believe these concerns are valid in light of their (i.e. Security
Innovation) lack of  action (that I have cited) about perceived OWASP
brand abuse i.e.
https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2011-August/006011.html

I would welcome Dinis to clarify what I hope is my misunderstanding?

Subject: [Owasp-london] My presentation at OWASP AppSec Brazil: "Making
 Security Invisible by Becoming the Developer's Best Friends"
Message-ID: <CA+f=kXDwu7g-s-2QDjG_wvAdNpR+_7=6LY_vGAYPhh3WsORS4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, here is the presentation I delivered last week at OWASP's AppSec Brazil
conference: OWASP Brazil - Making Security Invisible by Becoming the
Developer's Best
Friends<http://o2platform.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Brazil%20-%20Making%20Security%20Invisible%20by%20Becoming%20the%20Developer%27s%20Best%20Friends%20v2.pdf>

I think I was able to capture how security tends to be seen by developers,
how it is currently a TAX on the SDL and how we need to move Application
Security into the 'application visibility' space so that we add value to the
entire SDL (and create a positive model where the developers want to engage
with us)

After you read the presentation, check out this video which I recorded also
in Brazil: A developer's rant about security
professionals<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYEPYSF32kQ>
(he was one of the developers that was at the audience which really related
to the problem of receiving security guidance from security 'consultants'
that don't understand his app).

The demos showed how O2 allowed this world to exist :)

Let me know what you think of it.

Hi dear OWASP London fellows,

a colleague of ours from our chapter meetings is researching Best 
Security Practices for Agile development and asked me to forward a 
survey to the mailing-list in case you would be interested to provide 
input. After completing the survey myself and as I believe Application 
Security in Agile development could be an interesting topic for OWASP, 
I'd like to forward the link to his survey. Any input would be highly 
appreciated by him.

Kind regards and wish you all a nice weekend,

Tobias

Hey Toby

I agree, it would be a good topic for owasp to release some guidance on. No existing projects?

Wrote this a while back on my challenges with good practices: http://www.rakkhis.com/2011/06/agile-security.html

Will fill in the survey also

Cheers,

I'm working on too many other projects to lead one, but would do my best to

Christian,

I think you're jumping to conclusions. From the mention of Stockley Park I suspect I know who Dinis is talking about (FTSE 100 company Dinis?) and I'd be very keen to have a non-consultant talk on various topics like this. For this reason I've also been chasing one of the folks at GE Money to come down and talk about how they've deployed OpenSamm, as they are internal to the org, and as such have a different perspective to those of us who are external.

Subject: [Owasp-london] Fwd: Survey on Best Security Practices for Agile
In-Reply-To: <CAORxfg6dMiOWdKTYVMhWBqHxm1h5A-nzr+aB-jBMA-+1L0A1ig@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <1318844556.33893.YahooMailClassic@web86606.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

I would love to do something like this but would not know where to start. I have not worked in the security testing and don't know how Owasp projects are run. If I get some guidance may be I can give it a go.

With kind regards,



Mohinder Khosla, PhD

I'd love to see an OWASP Agile Dev project.
I'm working on too many other projects to lead one, but would do my best to contribute...

Hey Toby
I agree, it would be a good topic for owasp to release some guidance on. No existing projects?

Wrote this a while back on my challenges with good practices:?http://www.rakkhis.com/2011/06/agile-security.html

Will fill in the survey also

Cheers,

    Hi dear OWASP London fellows, 

    

    a colleague of ours from our chapter meetings is researching Best
    Security Practices for Agile development and asked me to forward a
    survey to the mailing-list in case you would be interested to
    provide input. After completing the survey myself and as I believe
    Application Security in Agile development could be an interesting
    topic for OWASP, I'd like to forward the link to his survey. Any
    input would be highly appreciated by him. 

    

    https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/JM6BKBX

    

    Kind regards and wish you all a nice weekend, 

    

    Tobias

        Hi Tobias,

        ?

        ???????????? I am conducting a questionnaire that presents all
        the
        major Agile and Security proposals and asks your opinion on
        their
        effectiveness and I think this would be good for you to take.

        https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/JM6BKBX

        
        

          If you think any of your friend and/or colleagues might also
          be
          interested then please forward the survey to them as well.
          Here is the
          link to the survey:

        
        Thank you very much,
