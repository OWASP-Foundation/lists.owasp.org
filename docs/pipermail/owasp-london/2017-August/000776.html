<PRE>Following the announcement at the 27th-July-2017 OWASP London Chapter 
Meeting we are pleased toannounce the first OWASP London 
workshop/working session event.

The OWASP London Chapter will be running a working session to develop 
new challenges for the upcoming OWASP London Capture The Flag (CTF) 
tournaments.

Capture The Flag (CTF) tournaments have long been used to test hacking 
skills, but they can also serve as an effective and fun security 
training for developers.

This working session is kindly sponsored and hosted by Just Eat.

Location: Just Eat, Fleet Place House, 2 Fleet Place, London, EC4M 7RF

building is directly opposite the front doors of Starbucks)

Doors Open at 6pm, the session will start at 6:30pm.

We are looking for participants who are a sound mix of:

  * security researchers
  * penetration testers
  * application security experts
  * secure application development experts (in various programming
    languages)
  * volunteers who want to write and maintain a set of CTF challenges
    for future events

This working session will be in the format of brain-storming, writing 
and peer-reviewing of the CTF challenges.

*IMPORTANT: Please bring your own LAPTOP and a charger for it*

Please note that if you are going to participate in this working session
