<PRE>Dennis Hurst, who will be speaking at our next meeting (see my previous 
email) has made a very generous offer to all OWASP members. See below.


***** Message follows ******

We would like to make a special offer to you and the people at OWASP as 
our way of thanking you for your support of our Lifecycle Security (web 
application security)Conference which we are holding the day after 
Blackhat-Vegas on August 8-9, 2008 at the Las Vegas Ceasar's Palace.

FREE ADMISSION (normal price is $350) for the first 100 people who 
register by sending an email to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">freeoffer at LifeCycleSecurity.com</A> with:

Name:
Company:
Address:
E-mail:

We plan to open this up to other lists later in the week, but we want to 
give OWASP members &quot;first shot&quot; at the free admission.  (There are only 
100 free admission tickets.)

Our goal is to create a community where Application Security 
professionals can share information on an on-going basis.

We have Ounce, Proactive, Price Waterhouse, ModSecurity, Microsoft, Safe 
Channel, OWASP and Verizon involved in our Penetration Testing, 
Policy/Compliance/Solutions and a Vendor Tracks.


Thanks once again for your support.
