<PRE>Hi,

Our next meeting is going to be on Thursday July 24th. As before, we are 
going to enjoy the beautiful location next to the Hammersmith bridge:

As before, Breach Security is paying for the space. I have a &#163;100 
allocated for free drinks, so be sure to tell your friends. I feel like 
I've done a particularly bad job organising this meeting so I now have 
to find a way to make it up. I'd like to see at least 20 people at the 
meeting! Also, please RSVP if you can.


19:00 Dinis Cruz: What is going on at OWASP?

19:30 Ivan Ristic: Evaluation Criteria for Web Application Firewalls
       (talk from the recent OWASP AppSec Europe conference in Ghent).
       If there's interest I'd be happy to cut the talk short and have
       a discussion of what WAFs can and cannot do.

20:30 Dinis Cruz: Building a tool for Security consultants: A story
       of a customized source code scanner

21:00 The official programme is over, but we can continue to socialise
       for a while longer.
