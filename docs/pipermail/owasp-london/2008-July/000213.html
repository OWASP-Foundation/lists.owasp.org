<PRE>It turns out it's going to be a busy night, as we will also be squeezing 
in Dennis Hurst, who will be giving a light talk on AJAX/Web 2.0 security:

--BEGIN ABSTRACT--
This session will begin with a brief overview of AJAX , Web2.0 and Web 
Services (SOA) technologies and details of the underlying HTTP request 
that they use.  The talk will then address some of the vulnerabilities 
that are common to these technologies including issues with attacks that 
leverage AJAX implementation mistakes, bridge attacks that are common to 
web service implementations and with sufficient time we will cover some 
of the issues that are coming about related to browser embedded 
technologies such as the latest versions of flash and SilverLight.
--END ABSTRACT--
