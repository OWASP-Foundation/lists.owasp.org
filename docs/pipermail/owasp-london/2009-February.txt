Subject: [Owasp-london] Reminder - next meeting: March 12th, KPMG,
	Canary Wharf
Message-ID: <C5B11703.7BEC%justin@justinclarke.com>

This is the first reminder for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting
to be held on March 12th (Thursday), at the earlier time of 6:30pm (like the
previous meeting).

The location is the same as for the previous meeting, at KPMG who have
kindly agreed to sponsor the evening:

     KPMG, 39th Floor, One Canada Sq, E14 5AG

We have the following talks confirmed, and I'm waiting on confirmation of an
interesting application attack focused talk, so will send out another update
once the final schedule for the evening is set.

*  OWASP Global Industry Committee - Colin Watson
- The Global Industry Committee was one of six new OWASP committees created
during the EU Summit in Portugal last year. Colin Watson will talk about the
committee's aims, plan, how to get involved, who it has been engaging with
and what else it has been doing in the first few months.

* The Software Assurance Maturity Model - Introduction and a Use Case - Matt
Bartoldus
- The OWASP CLASP Project has been going through modification to move more
towards a maturity model. As a result, the Software Assurance Maturity Model
(SAMM) project has been released in a beta version. The goal is to "define a
usable security framework with sequential, measurable goals that can be used
by small, medium, and large organisations in any line of business that
involves software development". This talk will introduce SAMM and give a
brief overview of its contents. We will then discuss how SAMM is currently
being used to measure the level of information security activities within an
EU based financial organisation's development methodology and providing the
framework for implementing such activities into their everyday development
activities (SDLC). 

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and it
looks like we could have a very good turnout from the number of RSVPs we've
received so far. 

If you are planning to attend please RSVP in an email to Hayley French from
KPMG (hayley.french at kpmg.co.uk) and CC me (justin at justinclarke.com).

Additional details and schedule for the night will go up on the chapter page
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London) and mailing list as details firm
up.

See you there!

Justin Clarke

I thought this may be of interest to some people on the list:

   Information Infrastructure Protection: Managing complexity, risk
and resilience
   MARCH 2009 COMPETITION FOR FUNDING
   http://www.innovateuk.org/_assets/pdf/competitioninformationinfrastructprotection1.pdf

>From the document:

"Projects should make real progress towards meeting the targets set
out in the UK Government's National Information Assurance Strategy and
mitigating electronic risks cited in the National Risk Register. These
take the form of clear and effective risk management; provision of the
right 'tools' for organisations to protect themselves; protection of
critical infrastructures from electronic attack; and enhanced public,
commercial, and industrial confidence in the UK's ability to manage
and protect information."

"All proposals must explain how the work will help in positioning the
UK in the global market and against other global innovation leaders in
the area. Projects should be mindful of how they might contribute to
the European Commission ICT Objective 1.4 Secure, Dependable and
Trusted Infrastructures and Objective 1.7 Critical Infrastructure
Protection."

Hi Colin, this is definitely something very interesting which we should try
to incorporate with the next Season of Code (I especially like they 'up to
150k' fast track process)

Do you know anybody there?

I'm afraid not.  I think it might be the sort of thing where a (UK)
university collaboration might go down well, but don't have contacts
in that area either.

I?d be interested whether anyone has been involved in one of these pitches
before?  This seems to me to be an opportunity to take one of the various
projects (and I?m thinking more on the process/SDL side here) and taking it
to the next level.

I want to tie this is with the efforts/talks that are happening with the
idea of applying to EU funding for OWASP  (Seba do you know who is leading
that?)

We are going to talk about this on the GPnT (Global Projects 'n Tools)
Committee call today (10pm UK time), and my current proposed strategy is to
request for a SoC (Summer of Code) 2009 proposal to write a proposal for
these types of government funding.

Hi All,

 

I have contacts on the Master Courses in Royal Holloway, UCL, South Bank, Greenwich, Portsmouth, Plymouth, etc. through my capacity as President of the London Chapter of ISACA, (and have lectured in some of these places). Also, apart from this funding, there are a few other competitions around at the moment that and OWASP led project may be eligible for. Also, I?d be happy to help with contacts in Europe if need be.

 

Also, if we do involve any students on a Master course, if they use this as part of their thesis, they may be eligible for the ISACA London Chapter Dissertation Competition; although the prize is only ?500 (ish), [it may even have gone up to a ?1000 ? I?ll have to check], it does offer excellent exposure to industry practitioners.

 

Dinis, I would be happy to lead on this if you like, and just to get him into more trouble, Colin (great to see you again yesterday), I would be happy to work on this with you, if you are able to?

 

Cheers

Sarb Sembhi

Hi Colin, this is definitely something very interesting which we should try
to incorporate with the next Season of Code (I especially like they 'up to
150k' fast track process)

Do you know anybody there?

I'm afraid not.  I think it might be the sort of thing where a (UK)
university collaboration might go down well, but don't have contacts
in that area either.

I?d be interested whether anyone has been involved in one of these pitches
before?  This seems to me to be an opportunity to take one of the various
projects (and I?m thinking more on the process/SDL side here) and taking it
to the next level.

Well, what a great response - that's very encouraging!  It seems there
are plenty of potential helpers.

As mentioned by others, we would need to think about the what, where
and how.  I believe the Global Projects Committee may have discussed
the what at their last meeting:

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/GPTC_Agenda_09_Fev_2009

The specific questions we may want to address right now are:

* is there / could there be an OWASP project that meets the TSB's
scope, "involve business-to-business or business-to-science
interactions" and "make a significant step change and overall positive
contribution in terms of economic and business impact as well as
environmental and social sustainability taking into account the full
product lifecycle."?

* are the timescales suitable?

* who would OWASP need to work with / for (e.g. UK organisation), to
have a chance of having a successful application?

and I suppose, how the money thing would work, especially if there are
other parties and since people undertake OWASP projects voluntarily.
Has OWASP undertaken joint externally-funded projects previously?

Message-ID: <b46e4cdd0902161029l76cf5deayebad0059121a3c23@mail.gmail.com>

Yes it's that time again.  Nominet launched the Best Practice
Challenge 2009 last week at the UK Internet Governance Forum.

    http://www.nominet.org.uk/about/bestpracticechallenge/
    http://www.ukigf.org.uk/

Last year we nominated OWASP in the Best Security Initiative Award and
Ivan Ristic wrote an engaging proposal.  Although we were shortlisted
(one of four), and were invited to the prize-giving ceremony, we did
not win.  However the judges did say:

   The judges felt that this project was democratic, international and
helps increase awareness of security issues.
   http://www.nominet.org.uk/digitalAssets/34028_Best_Practice_Challenge_winners_booklet.pdf

There were also comments that it would be good to see how we
progressed.  The chair of the judging panel this year is again Rt Hon
Alun Michael MP.  Well, I think we should nominate OWASP again, either
alone, or in conjunction with the Scotland chapter?  By the way, the
idea of the awards is to find best practice, highlight it and take
this to the (UN) Internet Governance Forum's meeting in Sharm El
Sheikh, Egypt later in the year.  The IGF themes are security, access,
diversity and openness.

Another thought might be to get the Egyptian OWASP chapter involved
with the nomination?

Perhaps we can bring in some other aspects to our nomination - maybe
the inclusiveness of OWASP is a great seller?

One more attempt?

Subject: [Owasp-london] Invitation - The Open Group Security Practitioners
 Conference - London
Message-ID: <200902210054.n1L0s7L3018532@postman.opengroup.org>

Hello,

The Open Group is planning our 2nd Security 
Practitioners Conference for London Monday April 
27th. This one day event will immediately precede 
the InfoSec show. The topics we intend to explore in this conference include:
?       Identity management issues related to cloud computing
?       Web 2.0 security
?       User experiences in implementing an 
Information Security Management System like ISO 27001

We would like to potentially involve your local 
OWASP organisation or chapter in our event in a 
couple of ways. First, we are open to 
presentation proposals from your membership. I 
have attached a Call for Presentations for the 
event, and if you could share this with your 
membership, that would be ideal.  Second, we are 
happy to extend our affiliate discounted 
registration rate to your membership. We will 
send a message to you in a few weeks, with more 
information about the conference, and with the 
affiliate code for your members use.

We believe this conference will deliver a lot of 
value to security professionals, and we look 
forward to your participation. Please advise if 
you have any questions that we can answer.

Regards,

Jim Hietala, VP Security - The Open Group

Dear UK Chapters

The OWASP Global Industry will be submitting a response on behalf of
OWASP to the interim Digital Britain report:

   http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/broadcasting/5631.aspx

In particular we would like to provide input to section 5.3 Online
Safeguards.  There are additional notes and links at:

   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Industry:Digital_Britain_Interim_Report

If anyone would like to submit ideas or suggestions relating
specifically to application security, please email me directly -
colin.watson(at)owasp.org - and I will produce a draft (deadline 5
March).  I will be talking about what else the Industry Committee is
doing at the next London chapter meeting on Thursday 12th March:
