Subject: [Owasp-london] SHORT NOTICE: Next OWASP London Chapter Meeting -
 Monday 25 February 2019 7:30pm at Photobox
Message-ID: <08c2b629-8bd8-da83-8d19-a5e0e52693aa@owasp.org>

All,

The next OWASP London Chapter Meeting will take place on Monday 25th 
February 2019 at Photobox offices. We have a special guest and speaker - 
Andrew van der Stock (the project leader of OWASP ASVS and OWASP Top 10).

Andrew is visiting London for a few days on his way to nullcon 
conference in India where v4.0 of OWASP ASVS (Application Security 
Verification Standard) will be released. Come learn about the completely 
new OWASP Application Security Verification Standard 4.0: what?s 
changed, what?s the same, and how you can use it for security 
architecture, agile security, secure coding and secure code reviews, 
unit and integration test cases, and now with 100% L1 support for 
penetration tests. The ASVS is the most comprehensive developer-focused 
application security standard, developed entirely in the open with 
contributions from all over the world. Over the last 10 years, adoption 
of the ASVS has become mainstream and it should replace the OWASP Top 10 
in almost all situations. Learn how you can use the ASVS in your day to 
day life no matter if you?re a coder, a security professional, or a tool 
vendor. You can register to attend this event here:

Subject: [Owasp-london] The decision to suspend your account. Waiting for
	payment.
Message-ID: <98E8561C1E26A254249AD0D2EA6E98E8@NDR6LS2N0YX>

Hello!

As you may have noticed, I sent you an email from your account.
This means that I have full access to your account.

I've been watching you for a few months now.
The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.

If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.
Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device.
This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.

I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.

Why your antivirus did not detect malware?
Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.

I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched.
With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks.
I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.

If you want to prevent this,
transfer the amount of $685 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: "Buy Bitcoin").

My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 1DASN5fH1E1PCoxU9qMEF7QDjnXcA2b3Km

After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never hear me again.
I give you 48 hours to pay.
I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.

Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address.
I do not make any mistakes.

If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.

Best regards!

Subject: [Owasp-london] Apologies for the spam message which made it through
 to this mailing list
Message-ID: <f76649b5-2071-fd30-446c-e33399a8b6a2@owasp.org>

Good morning everyone on the owasp-london mailing list,

The OWASP Global mailing list infrastructure is under an increased spam 
attack at the moment - you may have noticed that one annoying spam 
message made it through to our owasp-london mailing list last night. 
Please accept my apologies for any distress it may have caused. I hope 
most people on this mailing list are information security-savvy 
individuals and I hope that everybody was able to recognise that it was 
a spam. There is no need to send any Bitcoins to anybody and your email 
details are safe - the message was sent to the group e-mail and was not 
filtered out for some reason by the spam filter.

The OWASP Foundation is in the process of retiring the current 
Mailman-based mailing list system and moving the mailing lists over to 
Google Groups.? The specific plan with all the dates, the process, etc 
will be posted by the OWASP Global staff on the OWASP wiki within the 
next few days and as soon as the details are known we will publish them 
via this mailing list and other channels as well.
