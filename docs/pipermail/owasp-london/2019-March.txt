Dear OWASP-London Mailing List members,

As you may have already heard from Matt Tesauro (Director of Community 
and Operations at the OWASP Foundation) and Mike McCamon (Interim 
Executive Director of the OWASP Foundation) the current Mailman-based 
mailing lists are being retired and replaced with Google Groups-based 
mailing list system.

This affects ALL OWASP mailing lists and ALL OWASP Chapters.

If you would like to read Matt Tesauro's message - it can be found here:

https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2019-February/019703.html

and here is the link to the current Mailman-based mailing lists 
End-Of-Life Plan:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Staff-Projects/Mailman-EOL

As a result this mailing list is being migrated to Google Groups. You 
don't have to have a Google account to join, send and receive email from 
a Google Group.

Things you have to do now:

1) Join the London Chapter new mailing list by clicking:

https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/london-chapter/join 
<https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/london-chapter/join>

and entering your e-mail address.

please note:

 ??? a) you might be asked to solve a CAPTCHA ("I am not a robot" 
tick-box). We don't want any robots on our mailing list. Only humans please.

 ??? b) if you are signing up using a Google e-mail address you will be 
asked if you want to use your full name from your existing Google 
Profile when joining the Google Group/mailing list (you can opt out).

2) Amend any mail filtering rules you might have to expect messages from 
the OWASP London Chapter mailing list to arrive from:

chapter-london at owasp.org

instead of the old address (owasp-london at lists.owasp.org)

The old mailing list (this list!) will be discontinued on the 22nd March 
2019. If you have any questions about the migration process - feel free 
to drop me an e-mail.

Thank you all for your support and looking forward to greeting you on 
the new chapter-london at owasp.org mailing list.

Thanks and best regards,

Sam, Sherif and Greg (OWASP London Chapter Leaders).
