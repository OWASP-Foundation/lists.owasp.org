<PRE>This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to be held on Thursday March 4th, at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between 6pm-6:30pm).

We're at a new location this time, at Nomura who have kindly agreed to let us use their facilities:

- Nomura, Nomura House, 1 St Martins-le-Grand, London EC1A 4NP

Should be easier to find this time - this is near to St Pauls in the City, and Google Maps etc should be more accurate this time around for showing you where it is.

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at <A HREF="http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.">http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.</A> Note, please enter your real name, as this will be given to Nomura building security. If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close midday the day of the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">justin.clarke at owasp.org</A> so your space can be released for someone else.

* OWASP Top Ten 2010 - Fabio Cerrulo

The primary aim of the OWASP Top 10 is to educate developers, designers, architects and organisations about the consequences of the most important web application security weaknesses. The Top 10 provides basic methods to protect against these high risk problem areas and provides guidance on where to go from there. The Top 10 project is referenced by many standards, books, tools, and organisations, including MITRE, PCI DSS, DISA, FTC, and many more. The OWASP Top 10 was initially released in 2003 and minor updates were made in 2004, 2007, and this 2010 release. We encourage you to use the Top 10 to get your organisation started with application security so developers can learn from the mistakes of other organisations. Executives can start thinking about how to manage the risk that software applications create in their enterprise.

This significant update presents a more concise, risk focused list of the Top 10 Most Critical Web Application Security Risks. The OWASP Top 10 has always been about risk, but this update makes this much more clear than previous editions, and provides additional information on how to assess these risks for your applications. For each Top 10 item, this release discusses the general likelihood and consequence factors that are used to categorise the typical severity of the risk, and then presents guidance on how to verify whether you have problems in this area, how to avoid them, some example flaws in that area, and pointers to links with more information.

* Additionally, we will be having a discussion forum on the OWASP Top 10, and how can we best make use of it.
