<PRE>(Cross post to all three UK chapters)

Participants from the UK OWASP Chapters and the Global Industry
Committee submitted a brief response to last year's consultation on
the draft Data Sharing Code of Practice by the Information
Commissioner's Office (ICO).  &quot;Data sharing&quot; in this context is the
transfer of personal data within organisations and with third parties,
to undertake information processing.  It includes routine systematic
data sharing as well as one-off requests.  The final code of practice
was launched today.

OWASP limited it comments to security issues:

--------------------------------------------------------------

 1a. In &quot;Technical security&quot; OWASP said:

   ...add an item: &quot;If personal data is collected or processed using a
web product (e.g. website, web application, mobile application), have
the most common security risks been identified, removed or mitigated?&quot;

 1b. The published statutory code of practice says:

   &quot;Have you identified the most common security risks associated with
using a web-product - e.g. website, web application or mobile
application?&quot;

 2a.  In &quot;Technical security&quot; OWASP said:

   ...we believe &quot;is your information encrypted&quot; is too simplistic.
... a better question would be &quot;How is encryption implemented and
managed?&quot;

 2b.  The published statutory code of practice says:

   &quot;How is encryption of personal data implemented and managed?&quot;

 3a.  In &quot;Data standards&quot; OWASP said:

   a new sentence &quot;Ensure the data are correctly encoded and escaped
when output so they can safely be used by the receiving system.&quot;.

 3b.  Nothing was added to the statutory code of practice.

--------------------------------------------------------------

No direct references or links to OWASP were added, but the document
doesn't contain any others like that either.  The consultation had
about 100 responses, so we can't know what effect our feedback had,
but there seems to be a good match in 1 and 2 above.

Thanks to everyone who helped.

   Data Sharing Code of Practice (11th May 2011)
   <A HREF="http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/topic_guides/data_sharing.aspx">http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/topic_guides/data_sharing.aspx</A>

It is statutory guidance:

&quot;This means it has been approved by the Secretary of State and laid
before Parliament. The code does not impose additional legal
obligations nor is it an authoritative statement of the law. However,
the code can be used in evidence in any legal proceedings, not just
proceedings under the DPA. In determining any question arising in
proceedings, courts and tribunals must take into account any part of
the code that appears to them to be relevant to that question. In
carrying out any of his functions under the DPA, the Information
Commissioner must also take into account any part of the code that
appears to him to be relevant to those functions.&quot;

In case you hadn't heard, also this week, ACS Law were fined by the
ICO for the loss of 6,000 personal data records from their website
(access control 'flaw'?).  The fine would have been &#163;200,000 but since
the company had ceased trading, the final figure paid will only be a
token amount.
