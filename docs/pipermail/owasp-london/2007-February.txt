Hi, last week I did an audio interview with David from Uk's Next Generation
User Group (http://www.nxtgenug.net) about OWASP and my work as a security
consultant.

You can listen to the Podcast here:
http://www.nxtgenug.net/Podcasts.aspx?PodcastID=21

Or read the transcript here:
http://www.nxtgenug.net/Interview.aspx?InterviewID=146

Btw, NxtGenUg is a great bunch of guys, so for the ones of you in the UK
(and interrested in .NET), you should participate in their events.

Let me know what you guys think

>From http://www.owasp.org/index.php/London:

   - *Thursday 22nd February*
      - Location: The Water Poet Pub, Liverpool St, London

      <http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/17/17986/Water_Poet/Shoreditch>
   - *Presentations*:
      - by *Dinis Cruz (Chief OWASP Evangelist)* :
         - *OWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project* 30m -
         The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community
         dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain
         applications that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools,
documents, blogs,
         and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in
improving application
         security. In this presentation Dinis will show the latest
guides and tools
         from OWASP which should be part of every company's security efforts.
         - *Buffer Overflows on .Net and Asp.Net* 30m - One of the
         common myths about the .Net Framework is that it is immune to Buffer
         Overflows. Although this might be correct in pure managed and
verifiable
         .Net code, large percentage of .Net and Asp.Netapplications
code is unmanaged code. In this talk Dinis will show the areas
         in .Net and Asp.Net applications that are vulnerable to
         Buffer Overflows (including the demo of a .Net Buffer
Overflow Fuzzer).
      - by *Ivan Ristic*:
         - *ModSecurity* - 30m


   - *Schedule*:
      - 6pm - 7pm arrive and grab a drink
      - 7:00 - *OWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project*,
      Dinis Cruz
      - 7:45 - *ModSecurity*, Ivan Ristic
      - 8:15 - *Buffer Overflows on .Net and Asp.Net*, Dinis Cruz



Just so that I have an idea of the numbers, can you drop me a quck email
saying if you are planing to attend? Thanks


See you there,

Message-ID: <701fd6b60702201717w1e049461x922f39ff6c4b9f5a@mail.gmail.com>

Two quick updates

1) On the pub we are meeting (The Water Poet Pub, Liverpool St, London
map<http://www.beerintheevening.com/cgi-bin/map_link.cgi?id=17986&type=8>,
description<http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/17/17986/Water_Poet/Shoreditch>)
I forgot to say that we are going to use the downstairs room which you can
access from the back of the pub

2) I added one more (small) presentation to the night's line-up

*1**0m - **0wning Vista's userland - The CAS / UAC missed opportunity, and
what I think MS should had done* - In this presentation Dinis will explore
the missed opportunity by Microsoft to use technologies like .Net's CAS
(Code Access Security) and Vista's UAC (User Access Control) to create
secure and trustworthy userland environments that protect the user's assets.
In the hope that might make a small difference, ideas and solutions for the
future will also be presented.

     which will be a warm-up to the similar presentations that I will be
doing next week in MS land: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Seattle

I updated the http://www.owasp.org/index.php/London page with these details

See you on Thursday

I apologise in advance if you are not the person with whom I should be
speaking but I couldn't see any way to contact a particular individual.
 
I am not currently in the UK and so will not be able to attend the next two
meetings. I wondered if it would be possible to get a copy of the
transcription / ppoint slideshow for the David Mundge 'XML security &
management' presentation (post delivery of course) to be delivered at the
22nd March meeting.
 
Many thanks in advance and I look forward to attending at some point in the
future.
