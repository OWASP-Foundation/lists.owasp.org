Subject: [Owasp-london] Announcement: Next meeting 21st of May, Barclays,
	Canary Wharf
Message-ID: <C5FFD191.A88F%justin.clarke@owasp.org>

This is an announcement for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to
be held on May 21st (Thursday), at 6:30pm-8:30pm.  Note this is a week later
than usual as the previous week clashes with the OWASP AppSec Europe
conference in Poland.

We're at a new location this time, at Barclays who have kindly agreed to
sponsor the evening:

     Barclays, Presentation Suite 2, One Churchill Place, London E14 5HP

I am in the process of getting details from planned speakers, and should
have these up on the OWASP London page (and sent out in future reminders) in
the near future.

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should
have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well.

If you are planning to attend please RSVP to me (justin.clarke at owasp.org),
and I'll make sure you're added to the list of people the Barclays building
security folks are expecting.

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the
chapter page (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London).

See you there!

Justin Clarke

	May 13-14
Message-ID: <C5FFD7E0.A8A5%justin.clarke@owasp.org>

Reminder :-

May 13th?14th 2009, OWASP will hold its annual European Application Security
conference in wonderful Krak?w, Poland. Not only do we have 2 fantastic key
notes (Ross Anderson and Bruce Schneier) but we have 3 tracks stuffed with
high quality topics and great speakers and 8 one and two day tutorials. This
year we organise the conference together with OWASP Poland and
Confidence2009, a conference in Krak?w on May 15th-16th.

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Europe_2009_-_Poland

For those of you who haven't been to an OWASP AppSec conference, they are
well worth the trip, and generally a lot cheaper to attend than other, more
commercial, conferences. Also, Krak?w is fairly cheap to get to and stay in,
so those of you on a limited training budget (especially in this economy!)
this might be an ideal choice.

Best regards

Justin

Subject: [Owasp-london] Call for speakers for July 9th meeting
Message-ID: <C600F25E.A91B%justin.clarke@owasp.org>

Hi all,

I'm looking for a speaker, especially on the defensive side of things, for
our July 9th meeting, to be held at Barclays in Canary Wharf.

I'm especially interested if anyone has a good case study using the output
of the various OWASP projects in this space (e.g. AntiSamy, ESAPI) or
related projects on the management side (e.g. ASVS, OpenSAMM).

Other than that, I'm always interested in talking to members of our
community who have something interesting to present, so drop me a line and
we can discuss whether you'd be willing to talk at a future meeting.

Best regards

Message-ID: <C60A046B.AC37%justin.clarke@owasp.org>

This is an announcement for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to
be held on May 21st (Thursday), at 6:30pm-8:30pm.  Note this is a week later
than usual as the previous week clashes with the OWASP AppSec Europe
conference in Poland, and handily we've got Christian Heinrich presenting at
our London meeting on the topic he's speaking about in Poland :-)

We're at a new location this time, at Barclays who have kindly agreed to
sponsor the evening:

     Barclays, Presentation Suite 2, One Churchill Place, London E14 5HP

We have the following talks lined up:

**  Hash Cookies - A simple recipe - John Fitzpatrick

Hash cookies is a concept devised in concert with a couple of
other guys whilst discussing an application test we were working on. The
goal of hash cookies being to make session hijacking attempts infeasible
through re-hashing the session cookie on future requests to the server.

The aim of this talk is to put across the concept of hash cookies
and then have the audience don their ninja suits and break it. That way we
can work towards a robust secure mechanism for securing sessions which,
hopefully, hash cookies is a good solid step towards.

*  John Fitzpatrick is an Information Security Consultant, working for
MWR InfoSecurity in the UK.
  

** OWASP Google Hacking Project - Christian Heinrich

Two Proof of Concepts (PoC) used during the reconnaissance phase
of a penetration test will be demonstrated:

1. "TCP Input Text" extracts TCP Ports and Fully Qualified
Domain Names (FQDN) from Google Search Results into a .csv file and
individual shell scripts for nmap and netcat to provide assurance of a
listening TCP service since the last crawl performed by the "GoogleBot".

2. "Download Indexed Cache" retrieves content indexed within
the Google Cache and supports the "Search Engine Reconnaissance" section of
the recently released OWASP Testing Guide v3.  During the demonstration of
"Download Indexed Cache", the superiority of this approach will be proven
over lesser methodologies, such as "Google Hacking" and the associated
Google Hacking Database (GHDB).

The impact of mitigating controls, such as <META> Tags and
robots.txt, based on the recommendations within the
"Spiders/Robots/Crawlers" section of the recently released OWASP Testing
Guide v3, will be explained.

* Christian Heinrich is from Sydney, Australia and is the Project Leader
of the OWASP "Google Hacking" Project and "Download Indexed Cache" and "TCP
Input Text" code projects.  He has contributed to the
"Spiders/Robots/Crawlers" and "Search Engine Reconnaissance" sections of the
OWASP Testing Guide v3 and invented the "Speak English" Google Translate
Workaround. Christian has presented at RUXCON (AU), SecTor (CA), OWASP (US,
EU and AU) and ToorCon (US).

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should
have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well.

If you are planning to attend please RSVP to me (justin.clarke at owasp.org),
and I'll make sure you're added to the list of people the Barclays building
security folks are expecting.

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the
