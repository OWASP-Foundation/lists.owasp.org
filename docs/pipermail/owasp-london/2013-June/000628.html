Registration has just been opened. Early Bird closes at July 1st, so hurry up!

Here are the outlines of the agenda. The training will be on 20/21 August, the conference 22/23 August 2013.

Awesome trainings

(<A HREF="https://appsec.eu/trainings/">https://appsec.eu/trainings/</A>). Two days of pre-conference technical training with a focus on builders (PHP, Java, JavaScript), a bit of breaking and defending and satisfying the signs of time: Mobile!
And last but not least: Trainers with outstanding international reputation!

Exciting Conference program highlights (appsec.eu/program/talk-teaser/)

* David Ross (Microsoft): inventor of the XSS filter in IE8+
* Stefano Di Paola (&quot;DOMinator&quot;):  JavaScript libraries (in)security
* Yvan Boily (Mozilla): Application Security Manager @ Mozilla talking about the new security testing framework Minion

This surely very exciting conference will take place in the surely most exciting and most beautiful city of Germany: Hamburg (<A HREF="https://appsec.eu/about-hamburg/">https://appsec.eu/about-hamburg/</A>). With river and canal cruises, Europe&#8217;s second biggest harbour as part of the city, famous streets for nightlife, a vibrating cultural life, as well as a strong creative and tech industry presence, Hamburg is the ideal location to spur innovative thinking and knowledge sharing at the
AppSec Europe 2013 conference.

OWASP is the foremost web app security organization in the world, with thousands of members globally, including some of the biggest names in the industry. The goals of OWASP are to make web applications safe and to educate users, developers, governments, and business leaders on how to protect vulnerable information and avoid dangerous hacks that can cost millions of Euros to fix.
