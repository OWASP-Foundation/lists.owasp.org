<PRE>For the crown in West-London

See below an idea I had today, posted on my
blog&lt;<A HREF="http://blog.diniscruz.com/2013/06/open-library-for-my-raspberrypi-arduino.html">http://blog.diniscruz.com/2013/06/open-library-for-my-raspberrypi-arduino.html</A>&gt;,
 that could help to create the next generation of hackers :)

Drop a comment in there if you are interested to help, know of a good place
to host this, or have more ideas on this topic.

Subject: [Dinis Cruz Blog] 'Open Library' for my RaspberryPi, Arduino,
BeagleBone, Pyhton, CodeClub books and materials on the Chiswick High Road

Yesterday I '*dropped*' 10 Python books to a friend's kid house with a '*take
a look at these books and pick one that make sense to you*' workflow (they
are trying to use a RaspeberryPI and learn how to code in Python)

Later that day one of the kids asked me *'... can we keep two?..' , *which
is always a good sign :)

This got me thinking that that some of my books (I have lot of them)
deserve to be shared with more kids :)

Maybe I could have them '*somewhere*' on the local Chiswick High Road (West
London) as a kind of '*Public Geek Library*' for kids (and adults).

This could also be a great location to put information about
CodeClub&lt;<A HREF="http://codeclub.org.uk/">http://codeclub.org.uk/</A>&gt; and
examples of what I'm creating with the kids that I am teaching every
Wednesday.

Some draft thoughts:

   - At first, it is probably better if the books stay in that location
   - This makes sense to be on a coffee shop, or a bookstore close-to/with
   a coffee shop
   - The logic would be that the kids would stop by (with their parents)
   and read the books for a while (to get some ideas)
   - Maybe if there is a photocopier around, the kids could take some
   copies home
   - Ideally the parents would buy the books that are popular with theirs
   kids
   - Maybe if there is a sponsor, we can just buy the books and let the
   kids take them home (with a note &quot;please return it when you're done&quot;
   - I wonder if we can put a little tracker in the books that would signal
   where the book's are (nice project to do with Arduino/Electronics :) )

 I already have the books I need to kickstart this, so next I just need to
find a location for them

 Any ideas?
