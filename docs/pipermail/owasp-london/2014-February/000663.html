Will try to make this one (will be my first OWASP meet) - however I'm a little worried as I'm sure that's the name of the pub in 'American Werewolf In London&#8217;&#8230;

Hi all, 



ok, we finally made it: 



We are on for a game of OWASP Cornucopia in London!

<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia</A>



We organised a table to play Cornucopia on March 3rd 19:00 at the
The Slaughtered Lamb pub (what a name ;-) ).  



Pop Up Cornucopia in Clerkenwell

Date &amp; Time: Monday 3rd March at 19:00 hrs

Venue: At The Slaughtered Lamb, 34-35 Great Sutton Street,
London EC1V 0DX

(Nearest underground station: Farringdon) 



Just show up at 7pm. 

If you can, RSVP via email to me (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">tobias.gondrom at owasp.org</A>) would be
nice, so we have a rough idea how many people are coming. Imagine if
the whole OWASP London chapter would descend on a pub
unannounced.... - the pub might get &quot;slaughtered&quot;... 



Evening is of course free, but you will have to buy your own beer. 



And we have as special guest Colin, the designer of this OWASP game
joining us. :-) 



Timeline: 

Start: 19:00

after everyone got their drinks etc. we start with a 10 minute intro
into the rules of the game

and then we just have fun with Cornucopia security card game



Winner: the winner gets a free card deck of Cornucopia and
an OWASP bag (if we have more than one winner, we let the coin
decide)! 



And of course everybody gains a lot of fun and security
knowledge, enjoying a beer with OWASP folks. ;-) 



Looking forward to seeing you next Monday. 



Cheers, Tobias

&gt;<i> Hi all, hi Colin,
</I>
&gt;<i> 
</I>
&gt;<i> sorry, I couldn't make it to the meetup on Feb-5.
</I>
&gt;<i> 
</I>
&gt;<i> But since Colin's first presentation of Cornucopia, I was
</I>wondering

&gt;<i> whether maybe a few of you would like to just try it out,
</I>playing it on

&gt;<i> an evening based on any sample application (either from one of
</I>the

&gt;<i> group, or something general like internet banking, ebay,
</I>paypal,

&gt;<i> facebook). Could be fun and very interesting.
</I>
&gt;<i> 
</I>
&gt;<i> For example would some people like to play it on Feb-25 in the
</I>evening

&gt;<i> (like from 18:30-21:30)?
</I>
&gt;<i> Either reply here or via email to me directly.
</I>
&gt;<i> If we get enough interest, we can organise a normal meeting
</I>room and get

&gt;<i> some pizza and get the game going. ;-)
</I>
&gt;<i> 
</I>
&gt;<i> Would love to try it out and play it.
</I>
