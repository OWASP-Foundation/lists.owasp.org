Hi dear OWASP London chapter fellows,


CISO's Den - HMS President, River Thames, London 12th july

I just texted with the organiser Tim from ISSA-UK and he was so nice to 
extend a free entry for OWASP London chapter members! So he just updated 
the registration page to allow for free entry for OWASP members.
