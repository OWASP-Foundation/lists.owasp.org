All,

Our next meeting in September is at our new venue sponsor for the year, Skype, at their offices at 2 Waterhouse Square, 140 Holborn, London, EC1N 2ST.  

I?ve confirmed talks, however our second speaker (which was supposed to be me!) can?t make it anymore due to some last minute issues.

ACTION: Does anyone have a good talk that we can slot into the second spot on Thursday, or know a speaker we can reach out to (even better if you can reach out to them!)?

Talks:

? Global Application Security Survey & Benchmarking - John Smith
This talk will discuss the results of the recent global application security survey conducted by IDG Research and Veracode. Topics covered will include how enterprise application portfolios are growing and application security budgets are changing, and how benchmarking your organisation against your peers can bring your application security posture to the next level.

Speakers:

? John Smith
John Smith is the leading security expert in EMEA for application security specialists, Veracode. John has extensive experience advising some of the world?s largest organisations on information security and building tailored strategies to leverage the correct balance of people, process and technology to secure the application layer. John has over ten years? experience in IT and software security, specialising in web application security, security testing and vulnerability management. Before joining Veracode John worked as a Senior Security Architect at Sanctum and Watchfire, which became IBM?s application security practice after an acquisition in 2007.

The Eventbrite page to RSVP is here - http://owasp-london.eventbrite.co.uk/  Please note that RSVPs close the evening before the event so we get names on the door!

See you all there :)
