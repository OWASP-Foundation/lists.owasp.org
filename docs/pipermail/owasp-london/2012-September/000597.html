<PRE>Hello dear OWASP London fellows,
*

maybe a small info just fyi:
OWASP will again hold elections for part of our board members this year. 
And voting is of course open to all members.

The OWASP election is rapidly approaching!  Five candidates will be 
competing for three seats in the OWASP International Board of Directors. 
The candidate interviews have been posted. Please scroll to the bottom 
of 2012 Election 
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership/2012_Election">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership/2012_Election</A>&gt; and listen to 
the interviews.

The membership deadline for eligibility to vote in the OWASP election is 
September**30, 2012.**

The OWASP members are not paid marketing people, or paid by OWASP for 
our efforts;  we are all volunteers, just like you.  We pay membership 
because we want to support our local chapter, OWASP projects, and other 
efforts to raise awareness of critical software security issues.  OWASP 
needs the donation to continue to provide vendor neutral services and to 
continue to develop quality tools and documentation in an open source 
community.

For less than $1/week, you can support your local chapter and vote in 
the Global OWASP Election. *


Become a member Today! &lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Newmembership">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Newmembership</A>&gt;
If you are already a paid member, than please accept our sincere thank 
you for your continued support.



Btw. the benefits of a paid membership go far beyond voting rights. For 
example, you can get a prestigious OWASP email address, discount at 
reputable conferences like OWASP AppSec and BlackHat, access to 
influential industry groups as well as various grants offered by OWASP 
and other information security companies. For less than a dollar a week, 
you will become a proud contributor to a financially strong OWASP. If 
you live in a developing country then the membership fee is even less 
due to the GDP discount.

*

Your vote counts! Join today
