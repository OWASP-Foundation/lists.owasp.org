<PRE>All,

We encourage you to present talks at our upcoming London Chapter events.

OWASP mainly focuses on these 3 tracks:

* Builders
* Breakers
 &#160; * Defenders

As a guideline we invite talks on the following topics (not an 
exhaustive list):

 &#160; * Novel web/mobile vulnerabilities and countermeasures (note: no 
zero-days, any vulnerabilities must be responsibly disclosed prior to 
presenting at OWASP events)
 &#160; * New technologies, paradigms, frameworks, tools
 &#160; * OWASP tools or projects - new and existing, best practices and 
experience of implementing them in your company
 &#160; * Agile Security and Continuous Integration
 &#160; * Secure development: frameworks, best practices, secure coding, 
methods, processes, standards, SDLC, code review
 &#160; * AppSec Pipeline - Automation and Orchestration
 &#160; * Threat modelling
 &#160; * AI and Machine Learning in Application Security
 &#160; * Browser security
 &#160; * IoT security and AppSec
 &#160; * JavaScript/Node.JS security
 &#160; * Mobile security and security for the mobile web
 &#160; * Threat Intelligence &amp; AppSec
 &#160; * Cloud security, Container security
 &#160; * REST/SOAP and API security
 &#160; * Security of frameworks
 &#160; * Payment Security, PCI impact on AppSec, tools, frameworks, best 
practices
 &#160; * Blockchain &amp; AppSecurity
 &#160; * Cryptography and its use (and abuse) in Mobile and Web Apps
 &#160; * Data Privacy, Governance , GDPR &amp; AppSec, GDPR &amp; Developers
 &#160; * Management topics: Managing Secure Software Development Life Cycle 
(SDLC), Managing Application Security initiatives, Developer Training

Recommended talk duration is 45 minutes with additional 10-15 minutes 
for any live demos and Q&amp;A.

We also encourage short &#8220;lightning&#8221; talks: 5-10 minutes in duration.

If you would like to present a talk at future OWASP London Chapter 
meetings please review and agree with the OWASP Speaker Agreement here:

<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement</A>

and contact the OWASP London Chapter Leaders via e-mail: 
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">owasplondon at owasp.org</A> with the following details:

1. The title of your proposed talk (up to 12 words)
2. The abstract summarising your proposed talk (70-150 words)
3. The speaker bio (70-150 words)

Please note that you can also pair up with a colleague and present a 
joint talk.

Please ensure that your talk is objective, stresses open source 
approaches, and avoids references to any commercial offerings of your 
company.

We are looking forward to your submissions.
