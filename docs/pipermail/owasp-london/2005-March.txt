Subject: [Owasp-london] Next London meeting
Message-ID: <df9d4a25cf6b46082e9c61a59e189cb1@owasp.org>

Hi all,

Just a quick mail in order for me to gain an understanding of what 
everyone wants in a meeting.

Schedule:
I know we briefly talked about the yearly schedule of the OWASP London 
meetings a while back, but i'd love to get an indication of when people 
would like to have them again (yes I'm blonde and I'm allowed to forget 
things on a regular basis)

Location:
Is everyone happy with the current location?
I know we need a projector and also the rental of that upstairs room is 
?50 per evening. I was thinking that we could introduce a mini 
sponsorship program to help in that aspect.

Speakers:
The need for speakers is important, so if you would like to do a 30-40 
minute presentation on anything pertaining to application security, 
send me a mail.
Is there any topic people would like to see covered in any future 
meeting?

Anyway till the next meeting

Daniel

   Thinking Stone (that's me) will pay ?50 for the upstairs room for the
   next meeting.

   P.S.

   I'll be out of London in the first three weeks of May so I'd
   appreciate if we could hold the meeting before or after that period.
   I think late April is a better choice.

Message-ID: <fad793fad963318c1c7025efabb07c2c@owasp.org>

Afternoon all,

As some of you may know, i was recently accused of "hacking" into a 
charity website.
Obviously for legal reasons i cannot go into the full detail, but you 
can take my word that this charge is so far from the truth, its 
shocking.

I never did any hacking, of any form, on the website in question and 
wouldn't even dream of it. I actually was giving a donation at the time 
and my concern was with the way the site presented itself and also the 
security of my personal details (address/credit card etc)

Unfortunately the downside of this is that the whole thing has 
destroyed any form of career i had within IT security (but given me 
time to work on OWASP stuff since I'm not able to work in this 
industry, thanks to the fine gentlemen who make up the met computer 
crime unit)

The next London meeting will be in late April, Ivan Ristic has 
gratefully offered to sponsor the event, it will be in the same 
location, but we still need a projector and speakers.
Anyone wanting to speak at the next event, please contact me off the 
list.

Don't always believe what you read in the papers, they only report on 
small aspects of the full truth and even then they seem to balls it up.

Daniel

Hey Dan,

What date has been set for OWASP-London then?

If its not the 20-22nd April, I can do a talk.  If anyone wants, I can go
over the latest paper ;-)

My new whitepaper focuses upon a method known as "resource metering" to
actively restrict (and possibly prevent) many brute force guessing attack
vectors that target custom web authentication processes.

The paper is now available from the NGS website: 
http://www.ngssoftware.com/papers/NISR-AntiBruteForceResourceMetering.pdf

As always, I'm happy to discuss the topic further and would value
discussions about the techniques talked about in the paper.

Abstract:     
"Web-based applications authentication processes are frequently vulnerable
to automated brute force guessing attacks.  Whilst commonly proposed
solutions make use of escalating time delays and minimum lockout threshold
strategies, these tend to prove ineffectual in real attacks and may actually
promote additional attack vectors.           
Resource metering through client-side computationally intensive "electronic
payments" can provide an alternative strategy in defending against brute
force guessing attacks.  This whitepaper discusses how such a solution works
and the security advantages it can bring."

Cheers,

Gunter


P.S. I've tied posting to webappsec at securityfocus.com etc. But nothing
appears - so either webappsec is stuffed (quite probable) or I'm on a banned
list (hopefully not).

Half the problem with computer crime units is that they need high profile
/ any cases to prosecute, otherwise they don't get funding, and their
little empires will disappear. Many cases are chosen simply to be warnings
to others.

Conflated with the usual problems of the police forces around the world
(essentially, they cannot afford to pay market rates and the lack of
career paths within them for specialists), it makes it very difficult for
them to retain quality staff.

I feel for Daniel. I hope he gets a judge who is willing to listen to
evidence presented, and will consider Daniel's intent, not actions alleged
by the prosecution.

Is there a possibility of calling expert witnesses? If he can, get a good
lawyer - if he's going to plead anything but guilty, a good lawyer worth
their weight in gold (which is why they charge similar figures of dosh).

Good luck,
Andrew
