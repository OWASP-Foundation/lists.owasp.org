All,

Unfortunately, Rick Doten isn?t going to be able to present at next week?s OWASP London chapter meeting as the planned trip which would have brought him to London at that time has been cancelled. I?m going to keep in touch with Rick to see if I can reschedule this for a future time, but in the meantime this leaves us in need of a speaker for next Thursday.

I have some folks I?ll reach out to, but due to the time of the year - did any of you see anything awesome at a recent event (i.e. BSides). We can and do invite speakers to reiterate good topics to the chapter so we can all benefit :)

Best regards

Justin

Subject: [Owasp-london] Reminder: Next OWASP London Event - May Chapter
	Meeting - Thursday, 15th May 2014, 6:30pm-8:30pm
Message-ID: <D587E9EF-3DB6-46BF-A3E2-DC04DB13B5FC@owasp.org>

All,

Just to remind you all, our next meeting is next Thursday at our new venue sponsor for the year, Skype, at their offices at 2 Waterhouse Square, 140 Holborn, London, EC1N 2ST.  Talks are scheduled to start at 6:30pm, but we can all arrive from around 6pm, and there should be plenty of time for networking (and grabbing pizza and drinks) before and between the talks.

As previously noted, the lineup has changed as Rick Doten can?t make it (we?ll look to reschedule with him), but I think you?ll agree that the replacement talk will both be very interesting and timely for you all!

Talks

? Heartbleed Teardown - Hacker Fantastic
An analysis of CVE-2014-0160 ("heartbleed") covering detailed assessment of the vulnerability since it's introduction to OpenSSL on NYE 2011. The talk will also cover exploitation notes and detailed usage scenarios from an attackers perspective. We will discuss exploit development processes, traffic analysis and signature creation by IDS/IPS vendors as well as interesting things learned during exploitation. A demonstration of the vulnerability being exploited and its implications within multiple scenarios will also be performed.

? AppSensor 2.0 - Colin Watson
The AppSensor Project defines the concept of application-specific real time attack detection and response. A new AppSensor Guide book has been written to document the cumulative knowledge of the project's contributors, to provide illustrative case studies, and most importantly to showcase several demonstration working implementations. In this presentation Colin Watson will summarise the concept, bring the topic up-to-date, explain alternative architectural models, discuss the newly published implementation guide, demonstrate application security dashboards, and explain the code and web services implementations that attendees will be able to use immediately in their own projects.

Speakers

? Hacker Fantastic
Hacker Fantastic is a white hat who enjoys writing software, tinkering with computers and everything security related. He has been extensively researching computer security topics for over 10 years and has a deep interest in offensive security techniques. Hacker Fantastic is extremely passionate about computer security and has researched and developed offensive security tools against major product vendors including Microsoft, Apple, NetBSD, Cisco, Linux, Hewlett Packard, SCO, Silicon Graphics, IBM, SAGEM and NetGear.

? Colin Watson
Colin Watson is founder of Watson Hall Ltd, based in London, where his work involves the management of application risk, designing defensive measures, building security & privacy in to systems development and keeping abreast of relevant international legislation and standards. He was a member of the former OWASP Global Industry Committee, and is currently project leader for the OWASP Codes of Conduct and OWASP Cornucopia projects, co-leader for the OWASP AppSensor project, contributes to Open Software Assurance Maturity Model, CISO Guide and CISO Survey, and wrote the Application Logging Cheat sheet. He holds a BSc in Chemical Engineering from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, and an MSc in Computation from the University of Oxford.

See you all there :)

All,

Just a reminder - the global OWASP AppSec Europe conference is on in about 6 weeks in Cambridge.  Conference site is here: https://2014.appsec.eu

We don?t often have an opportunity to attend one of the global AppSec conferences in the UK (I believe its about 7 years since it was last held in the UK), so you should all have a serious think about attending if you can (have a chat to those managers about your training budgets!).

Subject: [Owasp-london] AppSecEU 2014 is coming! See you June 23-26 in
	Cambridge!
Message-ID: <5385F88E.5090001@owasp.org>

Hi all,

AppSecEU 2014 is approaching quickly and we have lots of great speakers
and exciting presentations and trainings for you.
Your opportunity to discuss with the best in our field, hear the latest
security tech presentations and learn and have a lot of fun.

This year AppSecEU will be in Cambridge, just a short 1-hour train ride
from London.
We got a great venue at Anglia Ruskin University's Cambridge campus and
will on June-25 have a stylish conference dinner in the Victorian Gothic
style Great Hall at Homerton College. An evening event not to miss. :-)

_*AppSecEU*__*2014*__
_*Date: June 23-26**
**Venue: Cambridge, Anglia Ruskin University

_Program: __
_Conference (June-25/26)**
*The main conference will be on June 25th and 26th with lots of amazing
keynote speakers flying in, and tech talks about the latest on mobile
security, hacking web applications and how to defend them, to management
topics like lots of best practices and stuff that works. And while
there, you'll have the opportunity to meet and discuss with your peers
and industry experts and also visit tables from our sponsors in the
hallway, who will show their latest tools and products at the exhibition
hall.
*T**r**ainings (June-23/24)*
Before that on June-23th and 24th we have 1- and 2-day training classes
and bootcamps where you can dive deep into the technical problems and
learn from the leading experts in the field (and see how deep the rabbit
hole goes). The classes will be about mobile app security, injection
flaws, WebHacking, defensive programming and writing secure code, up to
management trainings about openSAMM and a CISO training about managing
application security for senior managers.

Here the link to the conference page:
https://2014.appsec.eu

And for your registration:
https://2014.appsec.eu/registering-for-the-conference/

(For your convenience, we also secured a block of very affordable rooms
close to the venue - but better book quickly as they go fast.)

Please spread the word among your colleagues and friends and looking
forward to seeing you all end of June in Cambridge!

Cheers, Tobias
