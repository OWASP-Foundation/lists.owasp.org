<PRE>ISSA-UK and OWASP London are partnering for the first time to bring you a joint application security training conference, free for members of OWASP, ISSA-UK, or CSF. This unique event will attract attendees from both ISSA-UK's traditional information security membership base, and OWASP's web application specialists, bringing new thoughts and perspectives to both groups. The theme of the day is, no surprise, application security. We expect to focus on both methodologies and frameworks - such as OWASP's top 10 - and a variety of custom tools and frameworks, from open-source to proprietary. The goal is to deliver much needed tips and tricks to attendees, something to tackle our ever increasing workloads. Join us for a full day of application security tricks, tools and methods at the historic Bletchley Park. After the day's talks are over, please join us for a free tour of the famous WWII codebreaking facility!

Location: Bletchley Park, Sherwood Drive, Milton Keynes, MK3 6EB
Time: 10:00am - 4:30pm

Please note - OWASP, ISSA-UK, or Charity Security Forum membership is required for this event, and membership will be verified against the respective member databases. If you'd like to attend and are not already a member, OWASP membership is only USD$50 (about &#163;30 - which makes this still a very reasonable price, with a free tour of Bletchley Park!) - sign up at the OWASP Membership page (<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership</A>).

See you there!
