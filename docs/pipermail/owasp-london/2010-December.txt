Hello London List

A few London OWASPers are hoping to get together over lunch on
Wednesday 15th December at 13:00 hrs somewhere around Smithfield
Market, EC1.? So far Justin Clarke, Yiannis Pavlosoglou and myself are
planning to be there.? Anyone interested in coming along for the
social and to network a little, please email me directly.? If the
numbers are small, we'll just go somewhere on spec...otherwise we
might need to book.? We'll each be paying for our own food & drink.

Smithfield Market is close to Barbican, Farringdon and Chancery Lane stations.

Regards

Colin Watson

Subject: [Owasp-london] Call for nominations - London chapter board
Message-ID: <47C56B9C-9A48-4EF9-AB7A-A964BAA5AA96@owasp.org>

Hi all,

You might have noticed that we haven't had a chapter meeting in November or December. This was largely due to the inability to secure a venue towards the end of the year, but is also a factor of my lack of availability to chase possibilities to get this arranged. 

On that basis, its time for some new years resolutions for the London OWASP chapter - a bit early!  Its time to ask for nominations to constitute a London Chapter Board (incidentally doing what is recommended in the Chapter Handbook  - http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Handbook:_Chapter's_life_cycle).  

Why do we need a board?  Because more ideas are better than one, and in order for us to grow we need more effort that can be invested by one person part time. Other key things of interest is that it will greatly help us pitching for events such as the AppSec EU conference if we have a robust local board in place.

I'm envisaging that we'd ask people to commit 24 months to sitting on the board, before stepping down or standing for re-election.  I am planning on staying on as the Chapter Leader, and look to also stand down or stand for re-election at the next board election.  Therefore, we'll have a more formal process in place for running the chapter long term.

Roles we need to fill:
Membership/fund raising - in charge of advocacy for London membership, especially corporate memberships
Meetings - in charge of organising calls for talks and venues going forward
Education/OWASP materials - in charge of coordinating local educational initiatives and promulgating materials developed by OWASP

Actions - If you would like to nominate yourself, or another person, please email your nomination to the list, and which (if any specific) role you'd like to play. If we have enough candidates, and if those nominated by others are willing to stand, we will hold an election for the roles. Please get the nominations out by December 31 so we can get the process moving.

So, have a think about it, and get those nominations in by December 31, so we can hold any elections we need in early January, and get 2011 off to a great start!

Best regards

Justin

OWASP London, is there anybody here with a personal contact with Tim
Berners-Lee?

I would like to see if one of us is able to deliver him a personal
invitation to the OWASP Summit

it would be simply amazing to have him there giving us his view of what we
should be doing on Web Application Security.
