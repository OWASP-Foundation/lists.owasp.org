<PRE>This is the announcement for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to be held on Thursday July 15th, at 6:00pm-8:00pm (show up at venue between 5:30pm-6pm).

We're at a new location this time, at Commerzbank who have kindly agreed to let us use their facilities:

- Commerzbank AG, Gaumont Suite, 6th floor, 30 Gresham Street, London, EC2V 7PG

Note that we will be meeting slightly earlier than usual this time!

As always, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at <A HREF="http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.">http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.</A> Note, please enter your real name, as this will be given to Commerzbank building security. If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close the afternoon of the day before the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">justin.clarke at owasp.org</A> so your space can be released for someone else.

==Talks==

* Fun with Apple's IOKit - Ilja van Sprundel

[awaiting talk description]

Additionally, I'm in the process of confirming the second talk

[awaiting speaker bios]

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the chapter page ( <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London</A> ).

See you there!
