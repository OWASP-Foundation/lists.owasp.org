1. OWASP Ireland 2010 Conference: Register Early to win an Ipod Touch!

We are approaching fast to the biggest Application Security Conference in Ireland.

And just to make it more exciting we are going to raffle TWO Ipod Touch among those who register for the conference before our next chapter meeting on 11th August (more details below).

So grab your ticket in the URL below and be in a chance to win one of these great gadgets!

2. OWASP Ireland August Event: Security Implications for Web Applications based on SOA

This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP Ireland chapter meeting to be held on August 11th at 6:30pm-7:30pm (show up at venue between 6:00pm-6:30pm).

As usual our location are the Ernst &amp; Young offices in Dublin who kindly agreed to host our event:

- Ernst &amp; Young, Harcourt Street, Dublin 2, Opposite the Odeon Pub, Dublin, Ireland

As last time, we should have plenty of time to have a talk and a few drinks afterwards.

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at

<A HREF="http://owasp-ireland-august.eventbrite.com.">http://owasp-ireland-august.eventbrite.com.</A>

Note, please enter your real name, as this will be given to Ernst &amp; Young building security.

If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building.

A certificate of participation will be provided to those attending the event.

== Talk == 

Title: Security Implications and Solutions for Web Applications based on SOA

Abstract:

The main point of SOA (in this context) is combining systems and applications to make new applications, or a big 'overall' application.

This higher inter-operability does (by default) lower security. For a start, a request originating from a web user might end up at several back end systems, which do not know who or what the request came from.

Each back end system might have no access to the customer data, have a different security models, and serve serveral front end. Each of the above systems could be under different ownership, thus the owners have different concerns and priorities. Also, the basic solution at a technical level include single sign on, or security as a service. This can be costly, give limited coverage and have a performance hit. But is pretty much the only way to do it. The other thing to do (probably in tandem) is strict management, and delegation of authority.

== Presenters ==

John Marmelstein has about 13 years in IT. Most of this in distributed systems and 'Middleware' integration software. Including BEA (now owned by Oracle). Mainly working on Enterprise Java and more recently on Microsoft BizTalk. Various industries, incuding financials, public services, and a fish farm.

Further details and schedule for the night will be available on the chapter page:

3. Facebook Vulnerability: Like Clickjacking 

The Facebook Open Graph Like Button is susceptible to a type of attack known as clickjacking. Basically, if the like button is embedded on the page you&#8217;re on, made completely transparent, then an attacker could trick you into Liking something without your discretion. 

More information about this vulnerability here: <A HREF="http://erickerr.com/like-clickjacking">http://erickerr.com/like-clickjacking</A> 

4. Struts2/XWork remote command execution 

Apache Struts team has announced uploaded but has not released, due to an unreasonably prolonged voting process, the 2.2.0 release of the Struts2 web framework which fixes vulnerability reported back on May 31st 2010. 

<A HREF="http://blog.o0o.nu/2010/07/cve-2010-1870-struts2xwork-remote.html">http://blog.o0o.nu/2010/07/cve-2010-1870-struts2xwork-remote.html</A> 

5. HTML5, Local Storage, and XSS 

A nice new feature of HTML 5 is local storage. Briefly, this is a client side storage option that can be easily accessed via JavaScript. The benefit of local storage over other client side storage options is that local storage allows more storage space than other options (cookies, flash obj, etc). However, there are a few security considerations that should be evaluated before completely jumping on board with local storage. 

The complete article here:

6. Spring Framework execution of arbitrary code 

The Spring Framework provides a mechanism to use client provided data to update the properties of an object. This mechanism allows an attacker to modify the properties of the class loader used to load the object (via 'class.classloader'). This can lead to arbitrary command execution since, for example, an attacker can modify the URLs used by the class loader to point to locations controlled by the attacker.
