<PRE>This is the reminder for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to be held on Thursday July 15th (this Thursday!), at 6:00pm-8:00pm (show up at venue between 5:30pm-6pm).

We're at a new location this time, at Commerzbank who have kindly agreed to let us use their facilities:

- Commerzbank AG, Gaumont Suite, 6th floor, 30 Gresham Street, London, EC2V 7PG

Note that we will be meeting slightly earlier than usual this time!

As always, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at <A HREF="http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.">http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.</A> Note, please enter your real name, as this will be given to Commerzbank building security. If you don't RSVP, you may not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close the afternoon of the day before the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-london">justin.clarke at owasp.org</A> so your space can be released for someone else.

==Talks==

* Fun with Apple's IOKit - Ilja van Sprundel

[awaiting talk description]

* Real Time Application Attack Detection and Response with OWASP AppSensor - Colin Watson

The AppSensor project defines a conceptual framework and methodology that offers prescriptive guidance to implement intrusion detection and automated response into an existing application. The talk will provide an overview why conventional defences do not work, and how application intrusion detection can be used to identify, and respond to, attackers before they are able to find a flaw to exploit. Implementations will be described that have been tested against security scanning tools, manual attackers and how the technique could be used to defend against an application worm.

* Announcing final release of O2 - Dinis Cruz

[awaiting talk description]


==Speakers==

Colin Watson is chair of OWASP's Global Industry Committee and currently contributing, on behalf of OWASP to ENISA's efforts to develop a common assurance model. He is the technical director and principal consultant at web security consultancy Watson Hall Ltd. He has a particular interest in creating user trust and the relationship between security and usability.

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the chapter page ( <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London</A> ).

See you there!
