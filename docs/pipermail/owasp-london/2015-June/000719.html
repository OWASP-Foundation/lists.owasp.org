<PRE>All,

A reminder that our next meeting (and first for 2015) is this Thursday at our venue sponsor for the second year, Skype, at their offices at 2 Waterhouse Square, 140 Holborn, London, EC1N 2ST.  

We have two talks, including (based on the good feedback from December) another OSINT related talk from Christian&#8230; a hot topic with all the CBEST related activity going on in the FS industry. Also - I&#8217;m planning on talking on a more defence related OWASP topic, however I&#8217;m confirming some things with the project leads ahead of that, so I&#8217;ll announce that topic closer to Thursday!


Talks:
	
&#8226; OSINT SECURITY 2.0 Past, Present and Future - Christian Martorella

How OSINT will play an important role in the future, helping to predict, prevent and react against incidents that threaten the Global security. The presentation will delve into the tools and techniques that enable OSINT practitioners to measure the Global security signals conveyed by the Internet. Multiple facets of information dissemination, collection, analysis and interpretation will be examined, with a focus on the security dimension of the information.
