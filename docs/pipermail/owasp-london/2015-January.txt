The event details are now on the OWASP Manchester wiki page
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Manchester>.
And the tickets are available on Eventbrite
<https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/owasp-manchester-chapter-17th-february-2015-tickets-15434339525>
.

Quick summary of the talks:

*New web appsec research - James Kettle*

James Kettle is a web security researcher on the Burp Suite team. He will
be talking about a prevalent but little-understood web vulnerability, with
a real example of a recent 0day in a popular web platform.

*OWASP ZAP 2.4.0 - Simon Bennetts*

ZAP is an OWASP Flagship project and the most active open source web
application scanner. Simon is the OWASP ZAP project lead and works for
Mozilla as part of their security team. In this talk Simon will give an
overview of the new features available in the forthcoming 2.4.0 release.

*New features of Burp + New Web appsec research and scanning challenges -
Dafydd Stuttard*

Dafydd Stuttard is the creator of Burp Suite and author of The Web
Application Hacker's Handbook. He will be talking about a new technique for
web testing that will soon be available in Burp Suite, and which will
enable the automated and manual discovery of many types of vulnerability
that currently elude all but the best penetration testers.
This will probably be the only chance this year to hear about both the new
features in Burp and ZAP from the respective project leaders, so we expect
this event to be very popular - *book now!*
We wont be publicizing this on social media sites until tomorrow to give
regulars a chance to get tickets :)

Cheers,

Simon
