Subject: [Owasp-london] DDD:  	 Attacking Web and Windows Applications
Message-ID: <8da5cb9dbcc64040a982f20549bf8f46@ddplus.net>

I am going to do this speak at the next UK's DDD (DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper) event in the UK (http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/agendaddd2.asp)

 "...Attacking Web and Windows Applications

 In this session multiple attack vectors will be shown covering a wide variety of vulnerabilities and exploits: Sql Injection (basic and advanced), XSS (session hijacking and remote command execution), Elevation of Privilege, Web Services exploitation, AJAX exploitation, Rootkits (user and kernel level), attacking fat-clients by hooking into windows functions (and patching applications in real time), dynamically manipulating .Net client applications, exploiting buffer overflows, exploiting IE vulnerabilities, exploiting Full Trust Asp.Net, attacking IIS, and, using MetaSploit to automate attacks (and exploit generation)..."

 I sort of have all demos apart from the AJAX exploitation and the Metaspoit stuff.

 Anybody interrested in giving me a hand with these demos?

 Note: I will post as soon as I have some time to clean them up, the 'Rooting the CLR' demos that I did at the Washington Owasp Conference

Hi all,
This is slightly off the topic of security so appologies.
 
Is anyone aware of any Surrey based .net user groups. I have been to
some of the Vbug user groups but was a bit disappointed. Vbug also have
a costly (in my opinion) yearly membership fee.
 
I am thinking of setting up a .net user group based around Guildford,
Surrey. All .net related topics would be up for discussion (obviously
including security and OWASP). It would be a non profit group very much
run be developers for developers.
 
If anyone would be interested in participating in this please contact me
at alexjmackey at gmail.com <mailto:alexjmackey at gmail.com>.
 
Thanks,
 
Alex

Hi All,

 

I was at the DDD event (HYPERLINK "http://www.developerday.co.uk/"http://www.developerday.co.uk) in Reading on Saturday and managed to catch the security session presented by Dinis.  

 

Firstly, just wanted to say thanks to Dinis, it was a great session and a real eye opener.  As a result of the session I have joined the OWASP-London and OWASP-dotnet mailing lists and look forward to learning more about security and some of the less publicised .net security issues.

 

I also have tried to download some of the .net tools using the link HYPERLINK "http://www.owasp.net/Downloads/tabid/54/Default.aspx"http://www.owasp.net/Downloads/tabid/54/Default.aspx however I get an error, I am guessing not all the tools/content have moved to your new site?  If I have the wrong link I would appreciate if anybody could point me in the right direction, otherwise I will try this link again in a couple of days.

 

cheers,

James
