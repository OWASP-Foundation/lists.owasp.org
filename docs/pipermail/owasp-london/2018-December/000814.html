<PRE>OWASP London Chapter is pleased to announce that the next OWASP London 
CTF Tournament for Application Developers will take place on Wednesday, 
9th January 2019.

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a type of computer security competition. 
Contestants are presented with a set of challenges and puzzles which 
test their creativity, technical coding (and googling) skills, and 
problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories 
and when solved, each yields a &#8220;flag&#8221; which is submitted to a real-time 
scoring service. The difficulty levels are from beginner to advanced.

CTF tournaments are a great and fun way for software developers to learn 
a wide array of application security skills in a safe and legal 
environment. Identify vulnerabilities in the source code of various 
systems and choose the right solution to fix the vulnerabilities.

Top scorers will win prizes kindly donated by cyber security technology 
vendors.

Programming languages supported: Java, JavaScript (Node.JS, Angular1), 
C#, Python ( Django), PHP, Ruby-on-Rails, Go, Scala

IMPORTANT: Please bring your own LAPTOP and a charger for it to this event.
