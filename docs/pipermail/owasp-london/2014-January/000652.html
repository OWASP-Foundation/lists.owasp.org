<PRE>All,

Back into 2014 with a bash - and with a meeting in January at our new venue sponsor for the year, Skype, at their offices at 2 Waterhouse Square, 140 Holborn, London, EC1N 2ST.  Note - the 16th is tomorrow!

Talks are both confirmed, and both are ones that were a couple of my favourites from AppSecUSA late last year:
	
&#8226; Pushing CSP to Prod: Case Study of a Real-World Content-Security Policy Implementation - Justin Clarke
Widespread adoption of Content Security Policy (CSP) by most modern browsers has led many organisations to consider implementing CSP to thwart Cross-Site Scripting attacks in their web applications. In this session we will walk you through our experience successfully implementing CSP on our customer-facing web application, SendSafely.com, which relies heavily on JavaScript and HTML5. Our story will arm you with the knowledge you&#8217;ll want should you decide to go down the same path. When we initially decided to implement CSP, the BETA version of our website was already live. Like many sites, our platform grew from something we initially started as a pet project. Admittedly, building CSP into our site from day one would have been much easier...but not nearly as challenging or fun. We&#8217;ll start by walking you through our Content Security Policy, discuss the basic nuances between how each major browser implements CSP, and outline techniques for how we deal these nuances at runtime. Next, we&#8217;ll discuss the basic techniques we used for converting all of our classic &#8220;in-line&#8221; JavaScript to comply with the strict CSP that we developed. We&#8217;ll also talk about the not-so-easy task of getting third-party JavaScript to play nicely with CSP (cough, ReCaptcha, cough) and cover some edge cases we ran into related to the newer HTML5 APIs we rely on for certain tasks. Lastly, we&#8217;ll discuss what we learned from implementing a notification mechanism to report violations of our CSP at runtime. Needless to say we were surprised by what was reported, and we&#8217;ll share the results. Our hope is that by telling our story to the world, we&#8217;ll either save the rainforest or make your life a little easier should you decide to implement CSP (worst case scenario we&#8217;ll save you the trouble and dissuade you from even trying).

&#8226; 2013 AppSec Guide and CISO Survey: Making OWASP Visible to CISOs - Marco Morana and Tobias Gondrom
Recognising the important role that the CISO has in managing application security processes within the organisations, OWASP sponsored a project in 2012 to develop guidance specifically for CISOs. The aim of the OWASP guide is to provide useful guidance to CISOs for effectively managing the risks of insecure web applications and software by planning the application security activities, investing in countermeasures to mitigate threats and considering the costs and the benefits for the organisation. Recognising that a CISO guide has first and for most capture the needs of CISO in managing application security from information security governance, risk and compliance perspectives a survey was developed in parallel with the draft of the CISO Guide. As the results of the 2013 CISO survey have become available, they have been used to tailor the guide to the specific CISOs needs. One of the most important aspects covered in the CISO guide are to making the business case for application security investments by helping CISOs in translating technical risks such as the OWASP top ten into business impacts, compliance with standards and regulations and risk management. Specifically the version of the guide that is presented at OWASP AppSec USA will be the first version that highlights the results of the CISO survey and seek to introduce CISOs to projects/resources that can help them in rolling out an application security program whose main goal is managing web application security risks.
