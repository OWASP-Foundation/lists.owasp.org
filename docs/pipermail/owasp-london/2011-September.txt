My Apologies again for the flurry of emails,

The OWASP-RHUL meeting is in the Bourne Lecture Theatre at Royal Holloway,
in Egham, and is sponsored by the Information Security Group (ISG). The ISG
is one of the largest academic security groups in the world. It brings
together in a single institution expertise in education, research and
practice in the field of information security.

Cheers,

Dennis
