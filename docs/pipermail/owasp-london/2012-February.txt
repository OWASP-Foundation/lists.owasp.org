At Cray some 20 years ago we ran a number of metrics such as halstead and mccabe against test coverage results
to select sections of code for review. A review teams was then given specific individual taks for the review.
Lets just say the process saved Cray so much money on the sofwtare side that the hardware engineers used the
same process to review designs and microcode etc.

Christine Leake was one of the instigators of the project and was one of the very few professional "test
engineers" I have ever met.

My opinion...

These days we can automate a lot of tests such as bounds case generation, fuzzers etc
but you stil need to ensure the basics - does the app work and has the entrie codebase been tested
- for some definition of tested.

Another skill a good developer often lacks is the ability to prune down a test case so that it will
do its job and fit into the test suite. TTD is a good start for developers but reviews of tests and
especially test cases for fixes are critical.

This is decidedly A Bad Idea (TM). One must teach the correct way to do
things. One does not use bad examples to teach good behaviour.

We are discussing what to do with an ICT curriculum in schools, when youth
have little to no computer science or development background. They need to
learn the correct thing first. Only when they have a strong grounding in
best practices (which themselves are the subject of some debate) is a
comparison against broken software useful.


Consider spelling. One does not teach spelling by providing a long list of
misspelled words to children who don't yet know how to spell. One teaches
the correct spelling first. Once the foundations are well built, one might
introduce incorrect examples as a means of testing or reinforcing the
learning. But the most important thing to teach first is the right thing
to do.

Hacking and exploiting are cool in the way that graffiti and vandalism are
cool. They are destructive activities that cannot, on their own, create
something. They certainly don't need to be taught to kids who don't yet
know how to do good development.

It takes real skill, focus, determination, knowledge and passion to find
and exploit those issues. It's much more like detective work.

The key problem is that it is very hard to visualize what you mean by 'good
behaviour' until what you call 'bad behaviour' is understood.

NO, absolutely not.

They need to learn passion and love and craftsmanship first.

Programming is an Artistic endeavour, just like Maths (if you don't
understand what I mean, I would point you to Paul Lockhart's "*A
Matematician's Lament*" which is amazing and clearly explains what Math's
should be all about: http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_03_08.html )

In fact, we should be careful not to make the same mistakes (for
programming and secure programming) that the Math's crowd did when they set
up the current Math's curricular

Skiping the fact that even professionals in the programming and appSec
industry still have not come up with definitions and standards of 'best
practices', you can't teach by showing solutions. You teach (and learn
effectively) by providing a 'problem scenario' (where security is just a
component), and then letting the students find multiple ways to tackle
(with the teacher providing clues along the way)


> Consider spelling. One does not teach spelling by providing a long list of

sorry, but actually you do :)

I have a 6 and 8 year old and just saw this happening in front of me. In
the beginning the teachers are much more focused on getting the kid
interested in reading books, and they are not that bothered if the kid
reads the wrong word. The key is that the kid learns to like reading.

Correct spelling actually comes after reading, where once the kid starts to
learn how to sound things, he/she is thought the gramatical rules and
eventually have speling tests on blocks of words. Even then, the teachers
will reward kids that make good efforts and write down a spelling that
phonetically is equivalent

For example, I have in front of me a drawing from my 6 years old where she
has these words pointing to a picture:


   - iys
   - nows
   - grat
   - pursn


can you guess what they means? :)

Ironically, what you describe is how a lot of computing and programming
actually is taught today, and it is clearly is not working.

Note that I had a LOT of teachers at university and college that used those
techniques, and I learned more about computers trying to write C++ and
Assembly to play tricks on my colleges, than I ever did via the 'building
good foundations' way


>

That is your pre-conceived ideas of hacking, and maybe this is where we
have to part ways.

If you study history you will see that most computing advances where
created by hacking activities, and reducing it to 'vandalism' is bringing
down this conversation to a very low level.

You might as well say it is a 'terrorist activity' and remove any
rationality from this thread


> They are destructive activities that cannot, on their own, create
> something.


I believe in science they call this 'experimentation' , 'validation' and
'peer-review'.

Again if you think that only destructive actions come from hacking and
security exploitation, then there is not a lot I can say that will change
your mind.


> They certainly don't need to be taught to kids who don't yet

I happen to think the exact oposite, so maybe it is better if we just agree
to disagree :)

A lot of people would disagree with you Paco: e.g. [The Crazy 
Ones](http://herestothecrazyones.com/). In fact historically it is not 
just computer science advances (as Dinis rightly points out); but 
***everything*** is advanced by the so called ***hackers.***

Now, no doubt living at the edge produces is a risk of its own; and 
change always disrupts somebodies security.

To ask who is the more harmful - those who fight change or those who 
fight for change? And to marginalise one or the other; that is the wrong 
question (and the one you seem to be posing). The important question is 
how do we keep it balanced? (This is the role of Gandalf in the lord of 
the rings, and it is our role as security people.)

The horse is still breathing? just a few more whacks should do?

since when learning how to hack and exploit security issues is bad examples?

Teaching hacking and exploiting requires the presence of bad code. And that's the whole point. Learning to exploit SQL injection requires us to show students software that is missing everything we want them to learn. Knowing that the software is broken does not inform us on what would fix it. It simply tells us that we must fix it. How one writes software correctly is an entirely different question.

It takes real skill, focus, determination, knowledge and passion to find and exploit those issues. It's much more like detective work.

Teaching the right way to do things is orthogonal to teaching them passion and craftsmanship. You can be passionate about making code that is very, very correct. Or you can be passionate about breaking and exploiting things. One need not sacrifice passion and craftsmanship in order to teach doing the right thing.

We are discussing what to do with an ICT curriculum in schools, when youth
have little to no computer science or development background. They need to
learn the correct thing first.

NO, absolutely not.

They need to learn passion and love and craftsmanship first.

I respect this and I agree. I just don't see how hacking and exploiting is craftsmanship, whereas building correct software correctly is not. Nor do I see how one teaches either of these things (correctness or passion) to the exclusion of the other. The two things are unrelated. For every hacker you can point to who is passionate about his craft, I can find an equally talented developer whose code is solid because he is passionate about doing it right. There is no opposition between these two goals.

Consider spelling. One does not teach spelling by providing a long list of
misspelled words to children who don't yet know how to spell.

sorry, but actually you do :)

I have a 6 and 8 year old and just saw this happening in front of me. In the beginning the teachers are much more focused on getting the kid interested in reading books, and they are not that bothered if the kid reads the wrong word. The key is that the kid learns to like reading.

We have kids the same ages. When they practice reading, we are putting correctly spelled words in front of them over and over and over again. We don't teach them spelling at all until after they have spent years (hopefully) looking at lots and lots of correctly spelled words.

Correct spelling actually comes after reading, where once the kid starts to learn how to sound things, he/she is thought the gramatical rules and eventually have speling tests on blocks of words. Even then, the teachers will reward kids that make good efforts and write down a spelling that phonetically is equivalent

Again, no disagreement. But my oldest has not yet come home with a homework assignment saying "Some of these words are misspelled. Which ones?" Nor has he come home with a sheet of incorrect and correct words, where the incorrectly spelled ones are identified for him. We start putting a mixture of correctly and incorrectly spelled words in front of children only after years of exclusively showing them correctly spelled words. That's educational theory being put to practice.

That is what teaching hacking would be. It's putting good and bad software in front of a student and asking them to see the distinction. When they're in secondary school or university, they don't have that capability, yet. They don't know enough about software to understand which bits are good and which are bad.

We shouldn't show students broken software and talk about fixing it, until we have shown them lots and lots of good software and good practices they should emulate. Bad software is everywhere. Good software, that we might point to and say "go do it that way", is in desperately short supply.

Note that I had a LOT of teachers at university and college that used those techniques, and I learned more about computers trying to write C++ and Assembly to play tricks on my colleges, than I ever did via the 'building good foundations' way

I obviously can't argue what worked for you. What I appeal to is educational theory. Most people fall under the wide part of the bell curve and they need something a lot more basic that gets them good enough. Educational theory, which is all about doing the right thing for the majority, says you teach the right thing first.


Hacking and exploiting are cool in the way that graffiti and vandalism are cool.

That is your pre-conceived ideas of hacking, and maybe this is where we have to part ways.

If you study history you will see that most computing advances were created by hacking activities, and reducing it to 'vandalism' is bringing down this conversation to a very low level.

If we're going to quote movies, like Dennis did, I'll quote Star Wars: "Stay on target? stay on target?". I'm not suggesting things that will advance the field nor am I putting up stumbling blocks for those who would. I am answering the question of what we should teach everyone. What is the baseline we teach to? Hacking and exploitation are, as I said, destructive. They are not the kind of thing you teach everyone because they don't lead you to creating better software in the first place.

You cannot 'hack' me an enterprise-grade transaction processing system that meets stringent standards of reliability, accuracy, performance, security, etc. If you produce one of those things, then the activity you're doing is not 'hacking'. You cannot 'exploit' your way to a robust auth/auth system. If you produce a valid, correct, and reliable auth/auth system, you do it through processes that no one would call 'exploitation'. Thus if the goal we are trying to achieve is producing correct software that is secure, reliable, and meeting business goals, then teaching 'hacking' and 'exploiting' would be teaching activities that do not lead to that result.


They are destructive activities that cannot, on their own, create something.

I believe in science they call this 'experimentation' , 'validation' and 'peer-review'.

Those are fine processes. You neither 'validate' nor 'peer review' in order to create. Maybe a more palatable word is to say they refine, rather than destroy. Either way, they don't help the creator on his first draft. They only help the creator in subsequent drafts (be that a scientific paper, or software). We need to help people make their first draft better.

Experimentation is fine, but we're not suffering from a shortage of experimental, half-baked software. We're suffering from a shortage of rock-solid, mission-accomplishing, reliable, secure software. I don't want to dampen anyone's creative spirit. But when it's time to move that idea out of the garage and onto the market, it has to be built differently. We need to know that the average person you're interviewing, who came through a regular ICT program, will have a clue about building software well.

The original question was around what should be taught to every person learning ICT. I still maintain that hacking and exploitation have little value there. The majority of average people in the middle of the bell curve will gain nothing by it.

People need to learn to create well. That, indeed, is craftsmanship. Loving to create great and beautiful things is a very good goal. Learning how beautiful things can be exploited or ruined is of little value in achieving that goal. It is not something everyone needs to learn.

Message-ID: <CAORxfg6CVWhh5A86vfYMYbvSrjAhQT-HnKCJnejVy5DgSWskPg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

Thanks again to Dominic for a great talk, and to everyone who came along
and helped make it such a good evening.
I've uploaded all of the slides:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2012_02_01_Manchester (also linked off the
Manchester 'Past Events' tab).
For some reason the wiki would only allow me to upload my slides in .ppxt
format - if you'd like them in another format (eg pps) just let me know.

We had some good discussions about what types of talks we should have at
future meetings - I'll kick off another thread for that (and not spam the
other UK lists;).

As I mentioned at the meeting, please feel free to tell everyone about
other related events via this list.

Oh, and just to stay true to form (and because its too good an opportunity
to miss), as per my sig, OWASP ZAP won the Toolsmith Tool of the Year
2011<http://holisticinfosec.blogspot.com/2012/02/2011-toolsmith-tool-of-year-owasp-zap.html>poll!
Thanks to everyone who's contributed to ZAP and voted for it :)

Cheers,

Simon

 Development - Tuesday 28th February
Message-ID: <CAAxdBBnNgWQbuvQd7RctZ4MJRQZpWoJGU5PHb0+wFdVwkMdPSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dennis Groves, Fabio Cerullo and myself are helping support an
application security event in Cambridge, next Tuesday.

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Pilot_Cambridge_WebAppSec_Mini_Conference_2012

We're hoping to see if it can act as a catalyst to create an OWASP
local chapter there. The free event has been promoted to local
students, alumni and academic staff, local technology groups and local
BCS branches and about 70 people have registered.

Please register (free) if you would like to attend to hear the
presentations about OWASP, the projects OWASP O2, OWASP Open SAMM,
OWASP ESAPI and OWASP AppsSenor, or just if you would like to support
this initiative.

The event runs from 4pm to 8pm in the Lord Ashcroft Building, Room 002
at Anglia Ruskin University. registration and location details are on
the page linked above.

Regards

Colin Watson

Hi folks,

Just to let you know a couple of things:

We're in the process of setting up 2 new UK chapters -
Bristol<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bristol>and
Newcastle <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Newcastle>.
Still early stages, but please publicize them and join the relevant mailing
lists if you're interested in getting involved (running/speaking/attending)
in them.

And we've just set up a new list: owasp-uk-leaders at lists.owasp.org
If you are an OWASP UK Chapter leader then please join this list - the
intention is to use it for things like helping to arrange speakers, trying
to make sure our meetings dont clash, exchanging tips and trick etc etc.
You can also join it if you just want to know whats going on - after all
OWASP is an open organization :)

Cheers,

Simon

Yeah, that would be easy to set up, and well worth doing.

I like Tom's idea for an all UK list, but only if its automatic, ie just
includes the individual chapter lists, otherwise most people wont sign up.
Have to see if thats possible...

While we're discussing new UK chapters; what are the thoughts on an 
east-mids chapter?

I know a number of people in Derby and Nottingham who would be able to 
support an East Mids chapter who can't make it to Birmingham 
frequently. I'm also East Mids based.

I know Mozilla would be supportive of me spending some time on this 
(many of my colleagues are heavily involved in OWASP); also, I've got 
good contacts at a few of the local Universities (could be useful for 
hosting events, etc).

Cheers,

Message-ID: <4F4A4783.5030401@ntlworld.com>

Do members offer to redo talks at other venues such as LUG meets?
I may covering old ground but...

I know some LUGs have a hard time finding talks at this time of the year and
even a "web security basics" would go down well :-)

Surrey and Hants peroidically do/did a joint meeting so you could have an
audience of 30-60+ and not that far from London. I am sure other LUGs
would be amenable to similar talks.

Finally, in the past LUGs have had "product/company" talks from prospective
employers so if you are looking to hire please consider attending a local
LUG - there are *some* skilled folks and quite a few of the more dedicated
students attending these events and some already in work can be tempted away
- I have seen it happen more than once :-)

I gave an 'OWASP Top Ten' talk to the Manchester LUG last year, which
seemed to go down very well.
And I'd strongly encourage anyone to talk at more developer focused events.
The people who turn up to OWASP events are always going to be the ones with
an interest in security.
We really need to reach out to the people who dont realize its importance,
and try to convince them otherwise :)

Cheers,

Simon
