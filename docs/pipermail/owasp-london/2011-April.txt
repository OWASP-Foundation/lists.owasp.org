Subject: [Owasp-london] Keep the date - next OWASP London meeting planned
 for April 14th (i.e. Thursday)
Message-ID: <BANLkTikUkVD3y1+9m9paOY4uBegDo4B_9A@mail.gmail.com>

Apologies all for the last minute announcement as we've had some venue
issues that have slowed things down, however we are planning on having an
OWASP meeting this coming Thursday the 14th of April (final time and venue
announcement details to follow - somewhere in central London).

We have two interesting talks/topics of discussion :-

- A talk from Steve Lord on Wordpress Security
- a discussion of outcomes from the recent OWASP Summit in Portugal, "OWASP
4.0" and what is changing in the OWASP world now and in the near future

Abstract of Steve's talk:
Wordpress is one if the most popular blogging systems in the world but is
routinely used to shoehorn complex sites into a blog shaped box, often
because of it's flexibility and ease of use. In this talk, Mandalorian's
Steve Lord discusses common Wordpress security snafus and how to avoid them.

Steve's Bio:
Steve Lord is a technical director at Mandalorian, a Reading-based security
consultancy practice. When not helping developers secure their applications,
Steve reverse engineers malware and kicks out the bad guys. Steve dislikes
writing in the third person form.

As usual, we will have an RSVP running at http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com.
Please feel free to RSVP now so we know how many are planning on coming, and
more details will follow shortly as we confirm them.

best regards

Justin

This years? theme ?Dealing in Tomorrow?s Threats Today ? by Designing Security In?, will be addressed by many leading researchers and experts. Given that a vast majority of today?s vulnerabilities can be traced back to shortcomings in design failures and application coding, this event will provide practical information on Designing Security In.

Code in applications, operating systems, outsourced software, unattended devices (printers, routers, networked CCTV systems, etc) mobile devices, SCADA systems etc. all offer criminals plenty of opportunities to attack individuals, corporations, public sector leaving security professionals with a very challenging future.

The conference is designed to benefit Policy-level, Project and Technical implementation teams responsible for developing secure systems, including Lead Developers, Systems Architects, CISO's, CTO's, Compliance, Risk & Audit Professionals, Government Policymakers and others involved in systems development, designing / protecting new systems in house or managing existing/legacy systems.

Hi all,

So I get home from work, and this is what I see:

http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/13/hacker-gains-access-to-wordpress-com-servers/

Incidentally, while preparing my wordpress security talk I came across
a google dork for c99 php shells that returned 27,000 results, so I'm
not really that surprised. Just please don't laugh at me when I use
the words 'WordPress' and 'Security' in the same sentence.

To be fair to Automattic they haven't said whether the break-in was
infrastructure or application based, but it'll be interesting to see
what comes out between now and tomorrow night.

See you there,

Steve

I can certainly make the slides available afterwards, with some small omissions as there's some lists of vulnerable servers, and I'm a big girl when it comes to publishing stuff on the intertubes.

When we reach the OWASP Global AppSec EU ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSecEU2011 ) we will announce officially the candidates for the election and then move to a election by membership administrated by the OWASP Global Membership Committee.
