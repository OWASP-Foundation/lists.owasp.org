Just for the record:

*         I believe 100% in is innocence,

*         I think that what is happening with Daniel is one of the biggest
injustices that I have seem in a long time


What is very serious about this case is how the UK's CCU (Computer Crime
Unit) and the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service)  are able to prosecute
somebody in such manner (being arrested on the workplace) and under such
accusations.

Since this could happen to any of us, we should all take this case very
seriously and be involved as much as we can.

This case just shows how the current version of the UK's CMA (Computer
Misuse Act) is completed out of sync with the real-world and is an 'almost'
useless piece of legislation which is very inefficient in catching the bad
guys, but is very effectively used against the good guys (for example if you
tell anybody that they have a vulnerability in their website, server or
application you can be reported to the CCU under the CMA). 

In fact we should start a lobby group to put pressure to change this law so
that:
 
    a) the 'intent' of the 'accuser' is taken into account (the current
version of the CAM is used by companies to 'shut-up' anybody that is
'telling them' that about vulnerabilities in their products)

    b) the definition of 'authorized access' is very clear (If you look
careful to the current version of the CMA, almost all of us are potential
criminals, since It could be argued that we don't have explicit
authorization to access most systems we (legitimaly) access during our
normal work (note that this could include most software (except probably the
Operating System) that we install in our computers

Just for the record...

Afternoon all, 

As some of you may know, i was recently accused of &quot;hacking&quot; into a charity
website. 
Obviously for legal reasons i cannot go into the full detail, but you can
take my word that this charge is so far from the truth, its shocking. 

I never did any hacking, of any form, on the website in question and
wouldn't even dream of it. I actually was giving a donation at the time and
my concern was with the way the site presented itself and also the security
of my personal details (address/credit card etc) 

Unfortunately the downside of this is that the whole thing has destroyed any
form of career i had within IT security (but given me time to work on OWASP
stuff since I'm not able to work in this industry, thanks to the fine
gentlemen who make up the met computer crime unit) 

The next London meeting will be in late April, Ivan Ristic has gratefully
offered to sponsor the event, it will be in the same location, but we still
need a projector and speakers. 
Anyone wanting to speak at the next event, please contact me off the list. 

Don't always believe what you read in the papers, they only report on small
aspects of the full truth and even then they seem to balls it up.
