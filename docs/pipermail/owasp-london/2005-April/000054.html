<PRE>Funnily enough i agree!

the CMA was designed to be so wide open, that when they did catch 
someone who broke into a system, the law was able to come down on them 
like a ton of bricks.
The problem at the moment is that lawyers, and the courts, have no 
understanding of computer security law and thus treat it like normal 
unauthorized entry.

The worst part about this whole saga is that the CCU have destroyed my 
earning capabilities and hence whilst i wait for this to finish, i sit 
at home making music and twiddling my thumbs (so much for this innocent 
until proven guilty lark)

The hearing is next week thursday and yes we do have a brilliant legal 
team and case prepared and i expect some red faces to be shown when we 
do go to court.

Thanks for the support all

Daniel
