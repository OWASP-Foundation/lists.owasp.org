Subject: [Owasp-london] Reminder - Special Event - Application Security
	One-Day Conference - Free for OWASP/ISSA/CSF Members -
	Thursday, May 10th 2012
Message-ID: <4EE41D15-E5DB-4043-B274-DC0E482322C2@owasp.org>

ISSA-UK and OWASP London are partnering for the first time to bring you a joint application security training conference, free for members of OWASP, ISSA-UK, or CSF. This unique event will attract attendees from both ISSA-UK's traditional information security membership base, and OWASP's web application specialists, bringing new thoughts and perspectives to both groups. The theme of the day is, no surprise, application security. We expect to focus on both methodologies and frameworks - such as OWASP's top 10 - and a variety of custom tools and frameworks, from open-source to proprietary. The goal is to deliver much needed tips and tricks to attendees, something to tackle our ever increasing workloads. Join us for a full day of application security tricks, tools and methods at the historic Bletchley Park. After the day's talks are over, please join us for a free tour of the famous WWII codebreaking facility!

Time: 10:00am - 4:30pm

Hi All,

If the speakers on the day are in agreement would someone be able to video the sessions?

I can't be there but there are some topics of interest to me: Open SAMM, Mobile T10.

I can loan a tripod!

Adam Brown

- 2pm, Tuesday May 15*
*Reply-To:* ispainternet-safety at lists.ispa.org.uk

 All,



Following the publication of Claire Perry?s report into online child safety
and the subsequent Daily Mail campaign, ISPA and Consumer Focus are
organising a meeting to bring together ISPs and civil society
organisations.  The purpose of the meeting is to update on where we are and
look at potential scope for future work and messaging, particularly with
the Comms Green Paper likely to touch on this.



For instance, the freedom of expression implications for default filtering
are important but often sound better coming from civil society
organisations rather than ISPs.  Alongside ISPA, Big Brother Watch and ORG
have been criticising the plans, but it would be good to get more
organisations raising concerns.



The meeting is taking place from 2-4pm on Tuesday May 15 at Consumer Focus
(Fleetbank House, Salisbury Square, EC4Y 8JX). An agenda will be sent round
prior to the meeting.  Please let me know if you would like to attend.



Thanks,



Andrew

you want) at the next owasp Royal Holloway meeting on the 7th of June?

This is something that I don't have the bandwidth to organise or run on the day - if someone else attending wants to run with this, get it setup, do the filming etc I'm happy to help coordinate.

Best regards

All,

For those of you who were recently on-masse removed from the list during to a flurry of bounced emails, I've gone through and unlocked everyone's mailing list subscriptions. This is to test if this is all working as expected now.

(fingers crossed)

Subject: Is there a spreadsheet/template for Mapping WebServices
Authorization Rules?
To: owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org


What is the best way to map/document the Authorization Rules? (for example
of WebServices)

I'm looking for a spreadsheet/template that allows the business-rules (i.e.
'who has access to what') to be mapped, visualized and analyzed.

I looked at owasp.org and this is what I found (did I missed something?)

   - Guide to Authorization<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Guide_to_Authorization>

   - Codereview-Authorization<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Codereview-Authorization>

   - Testing for
Authorization<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Authorization>

   - Reviewing Code for Authorization
Issues<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Reviewing_Code_for_Authorization_Issues>

   - Cheat Sheets <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cheat_Sheets> (no
   Authorization one)

In the past I have created a couple of these (some even with
O2 Automation), but NDAs prevented me from sharing. So today, since I'm
helping Arvind to create a set of Python scripts to test TeamMentor's
WebServices, I took the time to create a model which I think came out quite
well.

You can read about it here: Creating a spreadsheet with WebService's
Authorization Mappings<http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/creating-spreadsheet-with-webservices.html>
and
this is what it looks like:

https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhHDFVmo550OdDZUcDU5eXpGVGFKWDZjS3VGUHdUTXc

[image: Inline images 1]

Since I'm going to integrate this with O2 next, it is better to change it
into a better format/standard now (vs later).

I also think that we should have a couple of these templates in an easy to
consume format on the OWASP WIki (I have lost count the amount of times
that I have tried to explain the need for
'such authorization tables/mappings' without having good examples at hand).

Note that creating these mappings is just one part of the puzzle! Also as
important is the ability to keep it well maintained, up-to-date and
relevant.

I received the attached email regarding an event in Oxford and
subsequently exchanged a few emails. The organiser would like a
speaker from OWASP. I' would propose a talk, but will be in Athens at
AppSec EU at that time as I am delivering a training course before the
conference begins.

Does anyone else have some ideas / time to write / submit something?

http://tech.brookes.ac.uk/CyberPatterns2012/Call%20for%20Contributions%20and%20Participation-final.pdf

Maybe I should email the OWASP Birmingham list too, but I thought
there might be more of an affinity between London and Oxford.

To: Clive Blackwell <cblackwell at brookes.ac.uk>


Hello

This is a final call for Cyberpatterns: Unifying Design Patterns with
Security, Attack and Forensic Patterns, as explained in the attached
call for contributions. This is meant to be an exploratory workshop to
seek common ground between the various research communities this theme
embraces (software engineering, logic, security and forensics).

The submission deadline has been extended to 14th May. Given the
exploratory nature of the workshop, reviewing will be based on two
page abstracts, so there is still time to consider submission.

I do hope you will consider making a submission and advertising the
workshop to your colleagues. The workshop will be held at The
Cosener's House, Abingdon, near Oxford, on 9/10 July 2012.

Kind regards

Ken,

I delivered a presentation on PA-DSS at Shmoocon in 2010 which is
available from http://www.slideshare.net/cmlh/padss

Also, our slides from OWASP Asia Pacific 2009 are available from
https://github.com/cmlh/PA-DSS

In case you are wondering the slides created for Shmoocon on the day
of their presentation because I didn't bring the slides that I
presented at OWASP Asia Pacific 2009 to Washington DC with me so if
you find any discrepancies please let me know and I will update them?

	=?windows-1252?q?is?=
Message-ID: <CAHw3cgQdTAcNN15a5uRj0qBrAOXL39Ah+j6P_VmfmvdxNNsjGQ@mail.gmail.com>

My final year university dissertation was on the topic of Static Code
Analysis, specifically the integration of IDEs (Integrated Development
Environments) with Static Code Analysis. The idea was to make Static
Code Analysis accesible to the developer, without them having to
istall and use additional specialist Static Code Analysis software.

Due to my familiarity with PHP and its lack of interpreter taint
analysis I decided that I would write a PHP Static Code Analysis
application. The PHP Static Code Analysis tool I developed is called
DevBug, it is an online PHP Static Code Analysis tool written mostly
in JavaScript (jQuery). The Static Code Analysis engine uses the
sources, securing functions and sinks data from the awesome RIPS
Static Code Analysis tool to identify specific PHP functions that can
cause or remediate user input caused vulnerabilities. DevBug uses
Taint Analysis to identify tainted variables, follows the tainted
variables through the code, untaints the variables if they are secured
and finally detects whether or not tainted variables end up in in
sensitive sinks.

The IDE used is called CodeMirror that provides a code editing area,
syntax highlighting, line numbering and an API. CodeMirror was
slightly modified to detect deprecated PHP functions and highlight
them.


DevBug has some known bugs and limitations at present which I will
address in the near future. For now it is still useful as a quick and
easy place to run some PHP functions or pages through to check for
potential issues. As far as I know DevBug is the only free online PHP
Static Code Analysis tool available.

The Taint Analysis takes part in the browser with JavaScript after the
PHP source code has been tokenized by the server. This was my first
real JavaScript related project so the code may not be as good as it
could be, for this reason, I may make the project open source in
future so that it can be improved upon and users benefit from the
knowledge of the open source community.

I?m still interested in bug reports or feature requests, DevBug can be
found here:
