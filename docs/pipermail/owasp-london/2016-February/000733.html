Please note that RSVPs will end on Wednesday evening (tomorrow) at 23:00, 
so we
could pass the guest list to the Microsoft Building Security in advance of 
the
event. You will not be admitted if your name is not on the guest list.

Also note that this event is currently oversubscribed - we have a waiting 
list
set up which will run all the way until 23:00 on Wednesday.

I would like to kindly ask everyone who has booked a place at this event, 
but is
unable to attend for any reason to kindly give up their free ticket by 
logging
in to EventBrite and clicking on &quot;Cancel Booking&quot; in order to make it 
possible
for the people on the waiting list to attend.


Looking forward to seeing you all on Thursday evening.

Sam
