Hi,

just fyi: small reminder and last minute info for the *Cornucopia
security card game tonight**:*
We have already gathered a little merry group for our security card game
tonight.
But lucky for you, I think we have still a few free seats at the table
(or we open up a second table if need be), so even if you have not
RSVP'ed yet, please feel free to show up *tonight* at:

*Date & Time:**Monday 3rd March at 19:00 hrs**
*Venue: At The Slaughtered Lamb, 34-35 Great Sutton Street, London EC1V 0DX
http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/
(Nearest underground station: Farringdon)

Please try to be punctual, because soon after getting our drinks
ordered, we will start with a little rule introduction and then dive
into the game.

Have a great start into the week and see you tonight,

Tobias

    Hi all,

    ok, we finally made it:

    *We are on for a game of OWASP Cornucopia in London!**
    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia
    *
    We organised a table to play Cornucopia on March 3rd 19:00 at the
    The Slaughtered Lamb pub (what a name ;-) ). 

    Pop Up Cornucopia in Clerkenwell
    *Date & Time:**Monday 3rd March at 19:00 hrs**
    *Venue: At The Slaughtered Lamb, 34-35 Great Sutton Street, London
    EC1V 0DX
    (Nearest underground station: Farringdon)

    Just show up at 7pm.
    If you can, RSVP via email to me (tobias.gondrom at owasp.org
    <mailto:tobias.gondrom at owasp.org>) would be nice, so we have a rough
    idea how many people are coming. Imagine if the whole OWASP London
    chapter would descend on a pub unannounced.... - the pub might get
    "slaughtered"...

    Evening is of course free, but you will have to buy your own beer.

    And we have as special guest Colin, the designer of this OWASP game
    joining us. :-)

    Timeline:
    *Start: 19:00*
    after everyone got their drinks etc. we start with a 10 minute intro
    into the rules of the game
    and then we just have fun with Cornucopia security card game

    *Winner: *the winner gets a free card deck of Cornucopia and an
    OWASP bag (if we have more than one winner, we let the coin decide)!

    And of course everybody gains *a lot of fun and security knowledge,
    enjoying a beer with OWASP folks. ;-) *

    Looking forward to seeing you next Monday.

    Cheers, Tobias

Hi Colin,

thanks a lot for explaining Cornucopia again.
Happy we had a great round last night. This was the first time I played
and it was very easy to learn (just 5 minutes or so) and lots of fun and
security!
This is the most enjoyable way of working out security requirements and
concerns for a project ever!
So highly recommended!
And for those who missed this opportunity, here again the project page,
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cornucopia
Will be taking this game also to APAC, sharing with the OWASP folks there.
See you at our next chapter events in London and in June at our AppSecEU
in Cambridge (https://2014.appsec.eu/ ) ,
Maybe we can even have a little Cornucopia game evening round there... ;-)

Tobias

Hi Tobias

Thanks for arranging this, and for everyone else who attended and played
OWASP Cornucopia. I've attached a couple of low-res photos. The originals
are a bit grainy - I should have taken along a proper camera.

OWASP London,

Apologies for hijacking your list but I hope this will be of some relevance to you.

I am in need of a SecOps (Security Operations Engineer) to work for an awesome cloud-software house, with a global product. The position is permanent, with a good package but I'm open to having conversations with contractors also.

The skills I'm after are as follows - would anyone be interested in finding out more be able to recommend a friend/colleague?

  *   Understanding of ModSecurity, Snort or similar security solutions
  *   Knowledge of the OWASP top 10 web vulnerabilities, the nature of the threat vectors, protection mechanisms and mitigations
  *   Thorough understanding of the http protocol
  *   Linux system administration skills
  *   Scripting or programming skills in a language such as Python, Ruby or Perl
  *   Threat analysis and threat profiling
  *   Attack detection and response
  *   Qualifications - probably nice to have - CISSP would be a massive benefit
  *   Knowledge of IIS and understanding of the security aspects of the MS platforms that run on IIS (ASP, ASP.NET web forms, ASP.NET MVC)
  *   Familiarity with PCI DSS compliance
  *   Able to use pentest tools such as Zap, Cenzic, Burp suite
Any help greatly appreciated and apologies again for misuse of the mailing list, I won't make a habit of it.

Many thanks,

Matt

Subject: [Owasp-london] Announcement: Next OWASP London Event - March
	Chapter Meeting - Thursday, 20th March 2014, 6:30pm-8:30pm
Message-ID: <10DFFFEC-2BCE-4161-82C6-B4BE33C1625B@owasp.org>

All,

Our next meeting in March is at our new venue sponsor for the year, Skype, at their offices at 2 Waterhouse Square, 140 Holborn, London, EC1N 2ST.  

One talks is confirmed so far, I?m open to suggestions on a second talk:
	
Talks

? Using Tunna (HTTP Tunnel) for penetration testing - Nikos Vassakis and Rodrigo Marcos
Once a web application is compromised and command execution is achieved, the attacker faces a number of hurdles. Network filtering is one of the key defensive techniques used to prevent attackers from creating further communication channels. This is usually an effective technique to limit the attacking avenues. Tunna is a tool designed to bypass firewall restrictions on remote web servers. It consists of a local application (supporting Ruby and Python) and a web application (supporting ASP.NET, Java and PHP). This presentation will cover all the steps required to effectively bypass firewalls protecting web applications, bind TCP ports on the compromised host and access other hosts in the DMZ.

Speakers

? Nikos Vassakis
Nikos is a security consultant at SECFORCE. He holds a BSc in Computer Science and an MSc in Information Security, and has 2 years of security related working experience. When not working breaking one technology or another, he drinks beer, socialises and when time permits works on research projects. Current research activities focus mainly on post-exploitation network traffic tunnelling techniques and trying to take over the world.

? Rodrigo Marcos
Rodrigo is a security CREST consultant at SECFORCE, with 10 years of experience in the penetration testing industry. His interests cover a wide range of areas, such as network protocol fuzzing, programming and "high-protein" web hacking - trying to minimise the gap between web application and infrastructure testing to achieve his ultimate goal: World domination, one IP address at a time.

I've setup the Eventbrite page to RSVP here - http://owasp-london.eventbrite.co.uk/  Please note that RSVPs close the evening before the event so we get names on the door!

See you all there :)

Thanks!

OWASP ZAP looks promising!

The videos at https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/Videos shows it working with selenium, I take it that it could work with cucumber as well, right?

Thats right - ZAP is not tied to any other technology, and we do our best
to work with everything :)
If you do get ZAP working with cucumber then please let us know - it would
be great to add some info about how to do this to our wiki.
And if you have problems then please also get in touch, either with me
directly or via the ZAP User Group:
http://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-users
ZAP is a community project: we strongly encourage involvement and do our
best to support anyone who is using it.

Cheers,

Simon

Talks

? Using Tunna (HTTP Tunnel) for penetration testing - Nikos Vassakis and Rodrigo Marcos
Once a web application is compromised and command execution is achieved, the attacker faces a number of hurdles. Network filtering is one of the key defensive techniques used to prevent attackers from creating further communication channels. This is usually an effective technique to limit the attacking avenues. Tunna is a tool designed to bypass firewall restrictions on remote web servers. It consists of a local application (supporting Ruby and Python) and a web application (supporting ASP.NET, Java and PHP). This presentation will cover all the steps required to effectively bypass firewalls protecting web applications, bind TCP ports on the compromised host and access other hosts in the DMZ.

? OWASP WebSpa - Yiannis Pavlosoglou
The OWASP WebSpa project is a tool implementing the novel idea of web knocking. The term web knocking stems from port knocking, If port knocking is defined as "a form of host-to-host communication in which information flows across closed ports" then we define web knocking a form of host-to-host communication in which information flows across erroneous URLs. In this talk we introduce web knocking and WebSpa: A tool for single HTTP/S authorisation requests. Similarly to traditional network port-knocking schemes, WebSpa aims to create a covert channel of communication for Operating System (O/S) commands, over the web application layer. Within this presentation the applicability, as well as the hurdles crossed while developing WebSpa will be discussed. The presentation will conclude with a video demo illustrating how a specially crafted URL will be responsible for allowing access to a previous closed TCP port 22 and other services.

Speakers

? Nikos Vassakis
Nikos is a security consultant at SECFORCE. He holds a BSc in Computer Science and an MSc in Information Security, and has 2 years of security related working experience. When not working breaking one technology or another, he drinks beer, socialises and when time permits works on research projects. Current research activities focus mainly on post-exploitation network traffic tunnelling techniques and trying to take over the world.

His interests cover a wide range of areas, such as network protocol fuzzing, programming and "high-protein" web hacking - trying to minimise the gap between web application and infrastructure testing to achieve his ultimate goal: World domination, one IP address at a time.

? Yiannis Pavlosoglou
There is a world of numbers, hiding behind letters, inside computers, this is what stimulates my work. I am currently employed in IT risk management within the financial industry, running a team of technical risk assessors. Prior to this, I spent 5 years in the world of professional penetration testing. I focused my career evolution on assisting large scale projects actually implement secure development practices. This included teaching developers how to write secure code. For OWASP, I was the project leader for JBroFuzz and used to chair the Global Industry Committee. I am on the Application Security Advisory Board of the (ISC)2. My academic qualifications include a PhD in information security, designing routing protocols for ad-hoc networks. I am a certified scrum master and hold the CISSP certification.

I've setup the Eventbrite page to RSVP here - http://owasp-london.eventbrite.co.uk/  Please note that RSVPs close Wednesday evening before the event so we get names on the door!
