Subject: [Owasp-london] Free OWASP books and t-shirts available on Thursday
Message-ID: <47F279B7.4050502@webkreator.com>

I have a bunch of OWASP books, pens and a few t-shirts sitting under my 
desk, just waiting to be given away to those attending our next meeting 
on Thursday.

Here are the rules:

  1. Each person attending gets a book. There are a few different titles 
available (e.g. CLASP v1.2, OWASP Guide v2.0, Code Review Guide, Top 
Ten, Testing Guide, etc.) and you get to choose what you get for as long 
as there is choice. If you send me an email with your choice I will try 
to reserve a copy for you.

  2. The remaining books we'll keep to welcome new members on subsequent 
meetings.

  3. Whoever brings a friend to the meeting on Thursday gets a t-shirt. 
Since there are only 8 t-shirts, please send me an email if you are 
bringing a friend and want to get a t-shirt.

See you on Thursday,
Ivan

Hi guys,

I just wanted to drop everyone a quick email and thank them for a great
evening last night!
The talks were excellent, the vibe was chilled, and the location rocks.

Thanks to Dinis and Ivan for getting it all organised, looking forward to
the next one.

A brief description of last nights activities and my "PHP Code Analysis:
Real World Examples"
are available on GNUCITIZEN (
http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/reviewing-practical-php-exploitation-techniques/
).

Cheers,
David
