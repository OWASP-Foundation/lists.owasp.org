Message-ID: <442E57B2.70901@ddplus.net>

Hello

I am thinking that it would be a good idea to do the next Owasp-London
meeting at the same time of the InfoSecurity conference in London (25th
to 27th of April) on the topic "Web Application Firewalls: Where do they
add value and who should be using them'

The format would be to have one or several vendors come in and do a 15m
presentation about their product (probably using it to defend against
SiteGenerator) followed by a panel discussion about them.

My main objective for the night will be to highlight the areas where Web
Application Firewalls are very effective (and deliver real value), and
the areas where they are useless.

Now that I have mastered (sort of :) the art of Podcasting (the
recording of my LondonDotNet 'Rooting the CLR' worked ok) I will podcast
this Owasp-London event and post it on the owasp.net website.

I know that F5 have previously shown interest in sponsoring an
Owasp-London event, so if you (F5) are still  interested, let me know asap.

For the other Web Application Firewall vendors, please also let me know
asap if you want to do a 15m presentation about your product.

Best regards

A couple of months ago I was at a OWASP Boston meeting with a similar topic. It was very interesting and I learned a lot. Netcontinuum (http://www.netcontinuum.com/) did the presentation and they or one of their distributors might be intrested in speaking in London as well.

Perhaps you should consider giving the vendor a bit more time to explain the concepts and ideas behind application firewalls. In Boston I think the talk was 60 minutes.

If Netcontinuum looks interesting I can ask them if they are interested in speaking.

Hi All

I think it might be worth seeing if DataPower (an IBM company) would be
willing to do a 15min pitch, sorry, presentation :-)

Their XS40 is something worth looking at. Who's co-ordinating with
vendors?

Thanks

Adrian

My only worry is that this becomes an excuse for the vendors to

I've just been looking at Imperva today funnily enough- the last of four
vendors - and i must say it is quite a strong player in this field.
Similar in functionality to NetC however there are some key
differentiators such as the layer 2 bridge, plugin modules and database
support for extra $$$.  Alls i know is the network guys dont like
another proxy/termination device.  NetC will have layer2 bridge soon....

Pro's and Con's for both vendors thats for sure.

Another good XML firewall is Vordel out of interest.  Additionally has
agents which i believe Datapower doesnt.  Agents (isapi, mod_so) are
good and bad I guess.

Anyone played around with Cisco's AON? (yeah yeah i hear you, what are
plumbers doing playing with apps? ;)

I totally agree, and that is my objective with the proposed Owasp-London
Web App Firewall session. To get the vendors to do a technical
presentation to technical people.

The current plan is to get the vendors of these products to show how
they are able to protect against the vulnerabilities that currently
exist in SiteGenerator.

I don't want to hear about the 'wonderful' features of their product, I
want to know how they deliver real value on real issues (i.e.
vulnerabilities) that exist on real applications

Subject: [Owasp-london] Owasp-London Chapter meeting: "Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Where
 do they add value and who should be using them"
Message-ID: <4446D626.3070705@ddplus.net>

On April 25th 2006, the Owasp-London chapter is hosting a meeting on the
topic *"Web Application Firewalls: Where do they add value and who
should be using them"*

This event will take place on the Priory House pub (see
http://www.priorybars.com/prioryhouse/findus.asp for more details and
maps), which is walking distance from the Olimpia exposition center. The
25th will be the first day of London's InfoSec Conference, so I expect
that most of you will go to the conference during the day and end up in
the Priory House pub for drinks, food and WAF talks.

The theme of the night will be WAFs (Web Application Firewalls) and the
idea is to bypass the WAF vendor's marketing materials and see where
WAFs can be used to increase the security of web applications. To
achieve this objective there will be 4 presentations from 4 different
WAF vendors: F5, NetContinuum, Imperva and Fortify Software.

Each vendor will be given 15-20 minutes to explain how their product is
able to protect a website that is vulnerable to a pre-defined set of
vulnerabilities (if you want their marketing material you can visit them
at Info Sec :). Basically the WAF vendor's brief is "... here is a
website which has X number of vulnerabilities AND (very important) it is
under attack. The client needs to patch these issues ASAP (no time to
wait for the developers to fix, test and deploy a new version of the
application (i.e. change the source code)). Basically the vulnerable
application must be protected without touching its source code..."

The Asp.Net website that these WAF need to defend is one created by
Owasp SiteGenerator (current version 0.70) and will contain
vulnerabilities such as: SQL Injection, XSS, Authorization issues,
Remote Command Execution, File disclosure,ViewState Information
Disclosure and Poor Crypto.

Agenda:

17:30 - InfoSec closes
18:00 - First drinks at Priory House and socialize
19:00 - (20m) Presentation:  "Owasp SiteGenerator" and
            "Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Where do they add value
and who should be using them" - Dinis Cruz
19:20 - (20m) F5 slot
19:40 - (20m) Imperva slot
20:00 - Break for drinks
20:20 - (20m) NetContinuum slot
20:40 - (20m) Fortify Software slot
21:00 - (20m) Panel with all vendors (with Q&A from audience) moderated
by Dinis Cruz
21:30 - Find food

For the ones that cannot attend, I will record this event and release it
as a podcast (now that I have mastered the way to do it :).

If you are planning to attend, RSPV to dinis.cruz at owasp.net so that we
have an idea of the numbers.

Finally I just want to thank F5 who is sponsoring this event (with the
Priory House venue, a Projector and maybe some drinks :)

Hello,

I would like to organize a training for Amadeus developers on the OWASP top
10 security issues. I am considering to use the Web Goat environment. But I
am a bit relectuctant having to create the training myself. Are you aware
of companies providing such training in England and/or in France?

Thanks for your help,

Message-ID: <444C24F2.40207@ddplus.net>

Since you might be interested, I am forwarding the email sent to the WAF
vendors that will participate on the next Owasp-London chapter event.

Note 1: The server mentioned (http://209.97.215.160) is a server that I
just got from Rackspace and is currently dedicated for HacmeBank and
SiteGenerator tests. For obvious reasons, most of the server's pages are
password protected (except the install folder which is available to
anonymous users). If  you want to have access to this server (for
example to test HacmeBank V2 or SiteGenerator),  drop me an email with a
promise that you will not blow up the server (using HacmeBank's or
SiteGenerator's vulnerabilities) and I will send you an account to use.

Note 2: At the end, I've included a 'quick & dirty' list of HacmeBank
vulnerabilities and exploits (organized using the Owasp Top 10)

Subject: 	London WAF event - Operational notes
Date: 	Mon, 24 Apr 2006 01:28:18 +0100
From: 	Dinis Cruz <dinis at ddplus.net>



Dear F5, Imperva, NetContinuum, Fortify and Breach

Here are a couple operational notes for this Tuesday's Owasp-London WAF
event.

    * The objective of this event is to create an environment where you
      (WAF vendor) are able to show your product in a scenario where
      WAFs add real value and business benefits. Please use it wisely
      since the audience is made of your potential clients.
    * For practical reasons (and due to a bug in SiteGenerator which is
      causing it to misbehave in some installation environments) we will
      use the latest version of Foundstone's HacmeBank (also Open Source
      and also developed by me)
    * I want you to focus your 15m/20m slot on how your product is able
      to mitigate against vulnerabilities that exist in HacmeBank.
    * At the end of this email I am including the specific HacmeBank
      vulnerabilities that I want to you to focus on (i.e. mitigate).
    * Ideally you should do a live demo since you (if participating)
      will have the products at InfoSec. This will help to maximize the
      impact of your presentation,
          o If that is not possible , then you can show pre-recorded
            videos (using for example Snag It). These videos can also be
            used as a backup in case there are some technical issues on
            the day
          o Please don't bring PowerPoints about your product. That said
            I don't see a problem with you making available to the
            audience marketing material about your product (i.e.
            brochures, CDs, etc...)
    * The version of HacmeBank that will be used is v2.00 which you can
      download from http://209.97.215.160/install:
          o Web Services installer:
            http://209.97.215.160/install/Hacme_Bank_WebService_Setup%20v2.0%20-%2018%20April%202006.msi
          o Website Installer:
            http://209.97.215.160/install/Hacme_Bank_Website_Setup%20v2.0%20-%2018%20April%202006.msi
          o HacmeBank User and Solution guide (pdf):
            http://209.97.215.160/install/Foundstone%20Hacme%20Bank%20User%20and%20Solution%20Guide%20v2.1.pdf
    * In order to facilitate your tests I have set-up a server which you
      can use. This server contains a fully operational version of
      HacmeBank and you can access it here http://209.97.215.160 using
      the user name and password which I will send you in my next email.
    * Two changes on the event's schedule and presentations:
          o Fortify will not present the Asp.Net version of their WAF
            solution (still under development). Fortify will present how
            their J2EE solution is able to mitigate Owasp's Web Goat
            vulnerabilities.
          o Breach Security will be also participate

I known that you (WAF vendor) is having limited amount of time to
prepare for this event, but (on the positive side)  it does accurately
simulate a scenario where:

    * "...  critical vulnerabilities have been identified on a very
      important website ..."
    * ".... no code changes can be made ..."
    * ".... vulnerabilities MUST be mitigated as soon as possible ..."


Deployment is another area which I (and the event's audience) will be
very interested in, namely:

    - WAF installation and setup -  how long does it take to get the
appliance installed and working
    - 'Patch' rules deployment - how long does it take the to install
and active the relevant rules

I understand why some of you are having some reservations in bringing
the WAF appliance to the pub and setting it up there. All I will say
that if you do it (and it all goes smoothly) you will score a lot of
points with your potential clients. After all, if you are not able to
install and deploy your product in such environment, what changes will
your clients have when faced with a similar situation (having to deploy
ASAP a WAF on a site under attack ).

For me the the best WAF solution will be the one that :
    - is installed with minimum changes to the current environment,
    - is quick to install and activate
    - allows a quick and flexible upload/update of rules (i.e. patches
for known vulnerabilities)
    - has NO impact on the pages that have no rules assigned to

This last point is very important. When deploying a WAF on an existing
website, there is no margin for error on pages/forms that are not
affected by the vulnerabilities targeted by the WAF (i.e. the WAF cannot
have any negative side-effects).

The final objective is to resolve 100% of the known vulnerabilities 
with no negative impact on the website's functionality.

Please see at the end of this email the list of the HacmeBank
vulnerabilities that I want you to focus your presentation on.

Here are a couple more interesting vulnerabilities from HacmeBank (Note:
most are not mentioned in the Foundstone HacmeBank 2.0 User Guide pdf)

Subject: 	London WAF event - Addidional vulnerabilities


Dear F5, Imperva, NetContinuum, Fortify and Breach

Following the positive response (from some of you) regarding the
successful mitigation of most of the vulnerabilities included on my last
email, here are 6 additional vulnerabilities (harder to mitigate):

    Vulnerability: Users are able to access account details belonging to
other users:
    Exploit: log-in as user jv and open the page
http://209.97.215.160/aspx/Main.aspx?function=TransactionDetails&account_no=5204320422040001
    replace the 'account_no' GET value with 5204320422040003 (i.e.
http://209.97.215.160/aspx/Main.aspx?function=TransactionDetails&account_no=5204320422040003)
and note that you are now accessing account details belonging to another
user (in this case the user jm)

    Vulnerability: Old Password requirement is not enforced in 'Change
Password' page    
    Exploit: Hijack user session (using for example a valid user's
Session Cookie), open the page
http://209.97.215.160/aspx/main.aspx?function=PasswordChange and change
that user's password (without knowledge of that user's current password)

    Vulnerability: ViewState replay vulnerability
    Exploit: The source account on the Transfer Funds page
(http://209.97.215.160/aspx/main.aspx?function=AccountTransfer) is
controlled by ViewState. This means that the attacker cannot change this
value by POST form injection, but means that if the attacker is able to
grab a valid ViewState from another user (via Xss, cached copy of that
page on a Hard Disk or by sniffing the traffic), it can replay that
ViewState and make transfers from that account (to an external account).

    Vulnerability: Web Services Session ID is not enforced
    Exploit: Invoke the web services directly without needing a valid
SessionID.
    Solution: the correct resolution of this vulnerability is one where
the Web Services are still publicly available but control to the exposed
Web Services functionality is managed via the SessionID

    Vulnerability: 'WAF redirect on attack detection' information leak
    Exploit: The normal WAF functionality of redirecting attacks
detected to a custom error pages, provides information to attackers that
such type of defense (WAF) is in use, and creates very dangerous 'False
Positive' situations where valid user's input could be wrongly flagged -
something that would severely affect the user experience and business
value (imagine a user filling a 4 page web form being redirected to the
error page on the last page).
    Solution: Dynamically 'normalize' potentially malicious input. For
example, on a Form field vulnerable to SQL Injection, rewrite that field
with only the allowed chars (for example letters and numbers) and flag
an attack

    Vulnerability: "How do we know we are being attacked?"
    Exploit: Attack the website via 1) the vulnerabilities that are not
'patched' or 2) pages not protected by WAF (i.e. with no rules applied)
    Solution: Alert WAF operational staff when such attacks are occurring

Finally here is one last question and demo request: "If your WAF has a
Web Interface, are you able to protect it using your WAF?"

After all presentations are done, there will be Panel Discussion (with a
representative from each WAF vendor) where we will discuss ideas and
solutions for the mitigation of the most complex vulnerabilities.
