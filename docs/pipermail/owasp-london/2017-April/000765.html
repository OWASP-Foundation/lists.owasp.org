machine learning, IoT and SSO exploitation, web app security with Fabio 
Cerullo, and Docker and DevOps security sessions.

AppSec EU Belfast comes with a full social calendar, with the main 
conference dinner taking place in the Titanic Suite of the Titanic 
Visitor Center, voted the best worldwide tourist attraction in 2016, 
including drinks &amp; music. This venue looks out onto the Game of Thrones 
studios in Belfast.

In addition there will be a Pre-Conference drinks event on the Wednesday 
10th May night, allowing everyone to settle in and mingle at the 
conference venue.

We hope to see many of you at the conference and a brief reminder that
