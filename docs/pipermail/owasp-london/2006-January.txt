Subject: [Owasp-london] Trusted Computing Conference
Message-ID: <ECOWS03MQjWrq0mQxjb00013d5f@smtp-out3.blueyonder.co.uk>

Hi All,

I hope nobody minds my promoting this event, I think it is important to
members on the list. The person organising it (Eddie Bleasdale from
NetProject) was the person who stood up at the end of the SANS Top 20 list
of Software Vulnerabilities, and basically said that the recommended
approach to spending all our energies on patching, etc was not the way
forward for the future of Security. There is a cover article in this months
SC Magazine.

Details are at: http://www.netproject.com/events/trusted_computing.html

The objectives of this conference are to:
- raise awareness of the need for trusted computing;
- outline the options that are available;
- highlight the implications of deploying trusted systems;
- discuss the steps that have to be taken to ensure the smooth migration to
systems that can be trusted to do e-business /e-government/e-banking.

Speakers include:
- Eddie Bleasdale, CEO, netproject
- Dr David Everett, CEO, Smart Card Group
- David Aucsmith, Senior Director, Institute for Advanced Technology in
Governments, Microsoft Corporation
- Alan Cox, Lead Linux Kernel Developer and Security Architect
- Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering, University of Cambridge
Computer Lab

The juxtaposition of speakers looks set to make for a lively and informative
meeting on a subject that goes to the heart of current problems on both
security and identity. I am told that the room will take a hundred and that
sixty places are already spoken for.

This conference is being held at:
The DTI Conference Centre, Victoria Street, London, On Thursday 26th Jan
from 9am to 1:30pm.

Attendance is free to IT managers/strategists.
To make a booking please send an email to info at netproject.com with the name
of the delegate.

Regards
Sarb Sembhi

February sounds good; I also have a major vendor looking to sponsor a
meeting so let me know if you need a venue, and/or proposals for speakers.

cheers, Sam Pickles

Subject: [Owasp-london] OI data exchange service
Message-ID: <CB70B5CCE4319D4ABEA54BB12D3117CF040C66@southcotpdc.southcot.org>


Hi I'm new to the list and have initially joined because I am in need of
advice. I am not by any stretch of the imagination and expert in this
field. Being new to the list please excuse any gaps in protocol - I am
willing to be told if there are.

Ok to my dilemma:- 

I currently supply and manage a server farm for a customer that sells
services via an application he has developed. The system uses RDP over
the internet and thus to now, has not posed any extraordinary security
threats.

This customer has now written an HTTP service for his application in
order to allow his database user to exchange data with local system they
are running on their PCs/Local LANs. The system does not have any HTML
interface and is purely a means of data exchange between his bespoke
OpenInsight database systems and the local ones using XML. I have been
charged with the task of rolling this out. I am looking for a means of
testing this service, as I have no way of knowing at the moment whether,
when running and listening on a public port to the farm it poses any
vulnerabilities. If you can suggest a lead for this I would be grateful.

I am not sure if you are supposed to discuss technical issues on this list, but given that the traffic on the list is extremely low I don't really see the harm of some technical discussions. If I am wrong please tell me so.

It sounds like the client wants to set up some kind of XML RPC / database sync on top of a HTTP transport channel. There are two separate issues that you must consider. 

The first is if the clients application as a standalone world is secure or not. Is there any form of authentication between the local database and the OpenInsight database? Is data encrypted and/or signed before it is sent over the open Internet?

The second issue is if it is possible to use the clients application as a vehicle to break into your system.

The first issue is perhaps not your problem, but the second one definately is.

The way to mitigate the risk is either to install a correctly configured XML firewall before the application, to harden the application (XML pen testing, source code scanning, etc) or to tunnel the connection over some kind of VPN.

Please contact me if you want to discuss this issue further.

Best regards
