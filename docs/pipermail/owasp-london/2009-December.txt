Subject: [Owasp-london] UK ICO - Consultation on the Personal Information
	Online Code of Practice
Message-ID: <b46e4cdd0912110824l6a101361g9f98b1199bfcaca5@mail.gmail.com>

Dear UK Chapters

This week, the Information Commissioner's Office launched their
consultation process for the Personal Information Online Code of
Practice.  The OWASP Industry Committee is coordinating an official
response from OWASP and would be pleased to receive any suggestions or
comments for inclusion.

This is not a technical document, and is most likely to be read in
organisations without their own security, compliance or data
protection staff.  Some extracts from page 7 of the draft document:

   "...build in security and privacy from the very start..."
   "...if your website offers auto-completion..."
   "...review your security arrangements on a regular basis..."
   "... assess the risks of a security breach..."

Further details at:

   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Industry:Personal_Information_Online_Code_of_Practice

If you have any comments, perhaps email them to me directly, and we
will create a draft response and circulate that.

Regards

Colin Watson
Global Industry Committee

Subject: [Owasp-london] Announcement - Next London OWASP meeting Thursday
 the 14th of January, at Nomura in the City
Message-ID: <C757F46D.15DD9%justin.clarke@owasp.org>

This is a reminder for the forthcoming OWASP London chapter meeting to be
held on January 14th, at 6:30pm-8:30pm (show up at venue between
6pm-6:30pm).

We're at a new location this time, at Nomura who have kindly agreed to let
us use their facilities:

- Nomura, Nomura House, 1 St Martins-le-Grand, London EC1A 4NP

Should be easier to find this time - this is near to St Pauls in the City,
and Google Maps etc should be more accurate this time around for showing you
where it is.

As last time, we should have plenty of time to talk and network, and should
have some time after the talks to have some more chatting time as well
and/or head out to a local pub afterwards.

If you are planning to attend you must RSVP at
http://owasp-london.eventbrite.com. Note, please enter your real name, as
this will be given to Nomura building security. If you don't RSVP, you may
not be let into the building. Also note that RSVPs close midday the day of
the event (so we can get names on the door), so make sure you RSVP in
advance.

Also, if you are no longer able to attend, please email Justin at
justin.clarke at owasp.org so your space can be released for someone else.

* Top Ten Deployment Mistakes That Render SSL Useless - Ivan Ristic

SSL is the technology that secures the Internet, but it only works when
properly configured. Unfortunately, because SSL is assumed to be easy to use
(and it genuinely is), there is a lack of information how to use it
properly. As a result, too many web sites use insecure deployment practices
that render SSL completely useless. In this talk I will present a list of
top ten (or thereabout) deployment mistakes, based on my work on the SSL
Labs assessment platform.

* Note: I am also in the process of confirming the second talk/slot in this
evening, so this will be updated on the site and on further announcements.

==Speakers==

Ivan Ristic is a respected security expert and book author, known especially
for his contribution to the web application firewall field and the
development of ModSecurity, an open source web application firewall. He is
the author of Apache Security, a comprehensive security guide for the Apache
web server. A frequent speaker at computer security conferences, Ivan is an
active participant in the application security community, member of the Open
Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and officer of the Web Application
Security Consortium (WASC).

As always, the details and schedule for the night will be available on the
chapter page ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/London ).

See you there!
