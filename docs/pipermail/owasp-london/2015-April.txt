Anybody going?

https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/hack-the-curriculum-and-include-birthday-celebration-tickets-15351043384

This looks like an really interesting event, and a great way to help to
shape the next generation of coders :)

I'm planning to attend, so if you have any good ideas on how we (OWASP) can
help, let me know and I'll relay those ideas

Since the OWASP London chapter meetings are having a slow 2015, some of you
might want to pop in next Monday to the UK Azure User Group meetup, where
I'm presenting on the topic of: *Secure coding in a SCRUM cloud*

You can RSVP here: http://www.meetup.com/UKAzureUserGroup/events/220849015/

More details of what I'm going to cover here:
