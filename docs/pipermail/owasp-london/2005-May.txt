Subject: [Owasp-london] Please welcome Owasp-Dotnet new Full time Project manager (for month)
 Sandra Paiva
Message-ID: <4281A012.80706@ddplus.net>

Hello

I am happy to announce that for the next month (9th May till 9th June)
Sandra Paiva will be working for Owasp DotNet as a project manager.

She is a very good friend and a highly capable and productive person.
She is going to work full time since she will be paid by my UK company
(DDPlus) for this (she just moved from Portugal to London and is
still figuring out what she will do here, so this is a win-win situation)

Please welcome her

...and since she will be focused 100% on owasp, send her all current
'to-do lists'. :)

Note that although she is being hired for Owasp DotNet work (and we have
a lot of work in there) everybody else will be more than welcome to
'use' her services for any type of Owasp work.

Her first jobs will be to:
     1) finish the owasp.net website (based on DNN) since it is almost
finished and I want to officially launch it next Saturday on the UK
conference 'Developers Developers Developers' which is occurring in
Microsoft's offices in Reading and where I am delivering the
presentation entitled "The OWASP .NET Tools / Full Trust ASP.NET
(in)security " (see http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/agenda.htm for
more details)
    2) help other owasp projects/chapters who want to use DNN to create
their web pages (she will start by clearing the backlog of requests for
Blogs and Message Boards)
    3) document all owasp .NET project and see which ones can be made
into 'products'
    4) Issue a press release regarding the launch of the new owasp.net
website and its community in the UK
    5) manage the creating of the 'Owasp .NET Top Ten Vulnerabilities'
and 'Owasp .NET Top Ten Best Practices' documents
    6) Help Jeff to make a list of all mailing lists so that we can send
emails globally to all Owasp members
    7) Work with Dinis (and the owasp dotNet community) in sending
comments to Jeff's presentation of the new Owasp Subscription model
    8) Work with the current Owasp members working on the new version of
the 'Testing Guide' and with Barry from Intense School to see if the
current ideas of creating a course based on that content become reality

That should keep her busy for a couple of days :)

Welcome on board Sandra

 UK
Message-ID: <4281A468.9050804@ddplus.net>

In case some of you are not aware of this.

I will be speaking at the DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper conference 
(www.developerday.co.uk) this Saturday on the following topics:

"
*The OWASP .NET Tools / Full Trust ASP.NET (in)security - *This session 
will contain an demonstration of the .NET Security tools currently under 
development at the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project).

Presentation of the vulnerabilities (not publicly acknowledged by 
Microsoft) that exist when ASP.NET 1.1 and 2.0 is executed in an Full 
Trust environment.

Partially trusted ASP.NET development will also be covered, as well as 
(time permitting) some case studies on Secure Web Application Development.
"

You can see the full agenda here 
http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/agenda.htm where you can see that 
there will be 3 tracks containing very good speakers and topics

It should be an interesting day.

Drop me a line if you are planning in going

Excellent. Could you please schedule in time for the Guide project? I need
help to finish it, and certainly, I would appreciate any assistance at
this stage.

In attending a course by Dave Aitel (http://www.immunitysec.com) on  
advanced web application testing methods?

Obviously this wouldnt be the basic level style of course, but more  
at finding faults in applications and using tools like SPIKE correctly?
Or, what would you love to learn from Dave in such a course?

Answers on a post card....

    Actually let me clarify this (my apologies)

Dave Aitel currently offers a load of different 2 day training  
courses, with topics like windows overflows, unethical hacking etc.
More info on those can be found on his site over at http:// 
www.immunitysec.com/education-overview.shtml

My idea was to have a 2 day course focused on application testing,  
but not just on how to use a proxy etc.
The content which would be covered in this course would make it worth  
the course fee alone and would aide everyone who is involved with web  
application testing

This is a great idea. We would definitely be interested.
