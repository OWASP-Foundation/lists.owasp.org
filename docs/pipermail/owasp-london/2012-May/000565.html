<PRE>ISSA-UK and OWASP are partnering for the first time to bring you a joint application security training conference.  This unique event will attact attendees from both ISSA-UK's information security membership base, and OWASP's web application specialists, bringing new thoughts and perspectives to both groups.   

The theme of the day is, no surprise, application security.  We expect to focus on both methodologies and frameworks - such as OWASP's Top 10 - and a variety of custom tools and frameworks, from open-source to proprietary.  The goal is to deliver much needed guidance to attendees, to help tackle our ever increasing workloads and bridge the gap between CISOs and applicaiton security specialists. 

Join us for a full day of application security education, tools and methodologies at the historic Bletchley Park.   After the day's talks are over, please join us for a tour of the famous WWII codebreaking facility!  The event is free for both ISSA and OWASP members. 

Keep your eyes peeled - we may slip a surprise into the agenda over the next week!
