<PRE>I received the attached email regarding an event in Oxford and
subsequently exchanged a few emails. The organiser would like a
speaker from OWASP. I' would propose a talk, but will be in Athens at
AppSec EU at that time as I am delivering a training course before the
conference begins.

Does anyone else have some ideas / time to write / submit something?

Maybe I should email the OWASP Birmingham list too, but I thought
there might be more of an affinity between London and Oxford.

Hello

This is a final call for Cyberpatterns: Unifying Design Patterns with
Security, Attack and Forensic Patterns, as explained in the attached
call for contributions. This is meant to be an exploratory workshop to
seek common ground between the various research communities this theme
embraces (software engineering, logic, security and forensics).

The submission deadline has been extended to 14th May. Given the
exploratory nature of the workshop, reviewing will be based on two
page abstracts, so there is still time to consider submission.

I do hope you will consider making a submission and advertising the
workshop to your colleagues. The workshop will be held at The
Cosener's House, Abingdon, near Oxford, on 9/10 July 2012.

Kind regards

Clive Blackwell
