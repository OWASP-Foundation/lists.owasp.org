<PRE>Hello OWASP Montreal.

Some people proposed us to do a meeting in a different way, where people
could present us anything related to application security and OWASP.

The talk could be 15-20 minutes long, and we could do about 2 or 3 during a
night.

If you know a great tool, or want to share with us some research you did, or
would like to get feedback about a security project you are thinking, well
this is the place.

Please reach me anytime, and by the way, we have a great open and respectful
audience, so don't be shy!

Thanks!
