Subject: [ OWASP - Montreal ] Training : Integrating security in a webapp
	project: from the idea to going live
Message-ID: <1CA459A3-70CF-4C2C-ACAC-E0FE003D1ADF@owasp.org>

Integrating security in a webapp project: from the idea to going live

=======================================================

Concept: A 1-day training covering 3 major topics related to integrating security in a software development project: - good practices and tools at design stage (security requirements, secure design, threat modeling) - good practices and tools at implementation stage (secure coding practices and code review) - good practices and tools at verification stage (security validation)

The entire training will follow a red-line based on a real-life HR web application project in which we will manage security and privacy aspects. Students will cover the entire lifecycle of the application, from analysis to deployment, and integrate good practices and tools based on OWASP material.

Trainers: - Antonio Fontes, Switzerland - Philippe Gamache, Canada - S?bastien Gioria, France

Course format: - The training is composed of three modules, each consisting of three 45-minutes blocks (total: 9 blocks) - Each module includes three blocks: theory, hands-on, validation/debriefing.

Schedule: - 8:45-9:30, 9:40-10:25, 10:30-11:15 -> "design" module - 11:30-12:30 -> lunch - 12:45-13:30, 13:35-14:20, 14:25-15:10 -> "implementation" module - 15:10-15:40 -> cookie break - 15:40-16:25, 16:30-17:15, 17:20-18:05 -> "verification" module - 18:10 -> closing session (debriefing/conclusions)

We expect students to arrive around 8am and be able to leave around 6:30/7pm

Pre-requisites (required skills and material): - Bring your own laptop (recommended: dual-core system running VMWare/Virtualbox) - Experience in web application development (hands-on will be in JAVA but do not require in-depth knowledge of the language) - Understanding of a web application project lifecycle - Understanding of well-known web application attacks (Top 10 attacks)

Bonjour,

Bonne question! Ce sera selon les gens inscrits... S?il y a des anglophones, ce sera en anglais, si tout le monde est bilingue ou francophone, la pr?sentation sera en fran?ais avec la documentation en anglais. La raison, c'est qu'elle sera aussi pr?sent?e ? Ottawa la journ?e pr?c?dente.

Hi Montreal Chapter.

It is time to get some action on the mailing list ;)

Are you aware of a process, document, hardening guide or anything
related to this need :

"How do you secure a source code repository, like svn, tfs etc.? I am
not talking about hardware or OS hardening, but specifically the
repository."

I saw lot of blogs with some good practices, but nothing as official
as the usual NIST/SANS documents we use for the OS hardening.

So how do you protect your sources?

Thanks!

You do open source and let the information be free!
