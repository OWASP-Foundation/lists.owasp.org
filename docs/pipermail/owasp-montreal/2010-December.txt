Subject: [ OWASP - Montreal ] New leader at OWASP Montreal, QC, Canada
Message-ID: <AANLkTinYXJfJBj7xw56nCVcnOOkGh7xTtetL7uyrms02@mail.gmail.com>

After starting up the OWASP Montreal chapter in 2008, I am passing the
lead to Philippe Gamache, the current vice chapter leader.

I feel that the chapter is in very good position, with great sponsors
as Gardien Virtuel, great support from the ETS university,money in the
bank account, and supported by an excellent team.

I organized 9 meetings up-to-date, and really appreciated the
experience and the new peoples I met.

Good luck everyone, see you on the next meeting.
