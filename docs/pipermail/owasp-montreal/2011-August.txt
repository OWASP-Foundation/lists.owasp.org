Subject: [ OWASP - Montreal ] Made-in-Montreal Vega compared against other
	web security tools
Message-ID: <4E388DEC.9070000@subgraph.com>

Hey guys,

Thanks for the opportunity to present in July.

Montreal made, open-source Vega was recently compared against a battery
of other commercial and non-commercial scanners. We did pretty damn
good, considering we're still in beta and just released a month ago:

We have a bunch of improvements coming, I'll announce something soon.

Check it out, try Vega, if you haven't already, come to MTLSEC, give
feedback in person. Looking forward to hearing from OWASP Montreal.
