[ Chapter leader candidate presentation for OWASP Montreal ]

[Name]
Jonathan Marcil
[Email]
jonathan.marcil at owasp.org

[Personal background]
Jonathan is involved in many communities events in new technologies
and recently part of ConFoo, a web techno conference, where he is on
the advisory board for security related talks. His main occupation is
consulting in Web security, but deep down he is a developer with a
agnostic vision of programming languages. He has a diploma in Software
Engineering from Ecole de Technologie Superieure and has more than 10
years of experience in Information Technology and Security.

I was VP of a startup last year and I?m not anymore. So basically I
have lots of time for OWASP Montreal and I?m really motivated to help
out.

[OWASP Background]
- Registered member of OWASP since August 2011.
- Represented OWASP at ConFoo 2012; Organized OWASP awareness trough
talk and a lunch speak. Represented OWASP Montreal interest.
International relation with European OWASP leaders.
- ConFoo 2013 is already under preparation and the same representation
will be provided.
- Arranged 3 talks at OWASP Montreal in the last year and a half.
Assisted most of the talks since 2 years.
- Volunteered two full days at BlackHat 2012 for the OWASP as the
?technical OWASP guy?. Met Sarah and Kelly from OWASP Global and a lot
of OWASP chapter and project leaders.
- Regular following of OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set Project.
- Representation at AppSec USA 2012 for the Montreal chapter. Attended
the Chapter Workshop. North American contacts for our chapter.
Volunteered as a "secondary speaker proctor" (helper during a talk).

[Planned contributions to the chapter]
- Increased social networks presence.
- Regular event organisation, diversification of events, not just
talks but other meetings related to OWASP projects when no speakers
are available.
- Participation from Montreal in official OWASP projects.
- Direct reach of international speakers during conferences around the world.

[Other plans]
- Integrate OWASP as a featured attraction at the next ConFoo conference.
- I have a bag full of OWASP stickers and will provide them for free.


Thank you for your consideration,

- Jonathan

OWASP Montreal - November 20th - Secure Code Review - OWASP TOP 10

	? MAIN PRESENTER: Sherif Koussa
	? ABSTRACT: Secure Code Review is the best approach to uncover the largest number ofsecurity flaws in addition to the most stealth and hard to uncover security vulnerabilities. During this session, you will learn how to perform security code review and uncover vulnerabilities such as OWASP Top 10: Cross-site Scripting, SQL Injection, Access Control and much more in early stages of development. You will use a real life application "SecureTickers" pulled from SourceForge. You will get an introduction to Static Code Analysis tools and how you can extend PMD (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/), the open source static code analysis tool, to catch security flaws like OWASP Top 10. Expect lots of code, tools, hacking and fun! *(Please note that the exercises will be mainly in Java.)
