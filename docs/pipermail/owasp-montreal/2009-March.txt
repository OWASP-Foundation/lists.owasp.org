I have been doing a few black box testing on some php system. I found that i
can escape the input box to write html. For example, i can add buttons, make
the text bigger (using B or h1) but i am not able to insert scripts, so far.


My question is: does any html injection can lead to script? Or is there some
php mecanism that detects any use of javascript (ex: onLoad, img
src=myscript.js)

P.S. Sadly, i cant provide the link.

To Javascript, yes, just try something like  txt" onClick=''alert('test')"
With a space at the end.

PHP doesn't have this mecanism directly, text going out, should always 
be escaped.  But the is phpids that detect injection, and the native 
filter to help filtering data.

Hi Laurent ,
I found this link
https://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Testing_for_Reflected_Cross_site_scripting_(OWASP-DV-001)&setlang=es
, which
does not provide exact solution for your problem but by doing preg_match
(Example 3) , you can make your scanner find javascript code.

Regards,
Arun

Hi Laurent,

Most HTML Injection can lead to cross site scripting or to cross site 
request forgery, only way you can protect yourself is proper encoding of 
any user input that are been redisplayed back to the user.  It seem that 
the site your testing does not do proper input validation and output 
encoding. OWASP have a PHP Anti XSS Library 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_PHP_AntiXSS_Library_Project, 
I have never used it so I can't tell you if it's good or not.

If you can inject <> you can usually inject image tag(<img 
src='/admin/adduser?user=w00t&password=w00t'>) , very usefull for cross 
site request forgery. You can also probably play with frames, flash, 
activex... You don't need to use SCRIPT tag to take over a session.

Also depending on what type of detection they do, there is many way to 
manipulate for a script tag to look different " <script >"or just like 
you mention use onLoad parameter. Rsnake have put together a extensive 
list of what cross site scripting look like and  you can find it on his 
site (seem to be down right now) http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html, if it's 
not back up just use google cache to get it.

No mater what if they allow unencoded '<' and '>' character it's game 
over, 99.99% of the cases and even if they do there is still many 
payload that doesn't require to use tag. I also went across many user 
input that would be then use inside a script, In those case you just 
have to end the script line without breaking the code and add directly 
some code in there...

One of my coworker wrote a Firefox extension called XSS Me, that will 
test a huge quantity of payloads and tell you witch of them are 
successful for the page you want to test, you can find that tool in the 
Firefox Add-ons(  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7598).

I also recommend a talk about BlackBox Reversing of XSS Filters that was 
given by Alexander Sotirov at my last conference

As Philippe said, always use htmlentities() when outputting unsafe  
data to the browser. Make sure you use the proper character encoding.
As for good filtering, check out HTMLPurifier.

Hello Laurent,

To add to what Hugo suggested, another useful tool could be the Tamper
Data extension for Firefox.

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/966

You can tamper with any POST request : Encode, Decode, Hex HTML,
un-HTML,etc.  There is a couple of basic but useful built-in attack
vector for xss, sql and data injection.

Cheers!

-Martin

To be clear, you need to escape all entities, not just < and >.

Specifically, consider the following example:

<?php
echo "<input type='text' name='user' value='{$user}' />";
?>

If this user supplies the string `' onmouseover='alert("XSS")` (where  
`` is the denoting character, not actually part of the user input),  
this page becomes a very likely target for XSS without supplying a  
single "< or >".

You always need to escape for the context where the data will be used.

I am looking for secure coding training in the Montreal area. SANS

training in Montreal.

.NET and JAVA. (For PHP I would hired Philippe Gamache for sure).

Any contact or idea for me?

Here is a couple of places where you can see the Montreal Chapter.

I am a fan of linkedin.com only, but I created groups on other
websites with the goal of attracting new members.

On the first meeting, a lot of peoples didn't know that there is an
OWASP chapter in Montreal, they learned it by a friend. So it is time
to work to change this!!! :)

I invite you to talk about the chapter to your friends, blogs,
workplace, websites, email signatures and so on :)

Some off topic... For the next meeting I would suggest before session
starting that all participants present themselves\company.
I think it will help to the audience.

We can't apply this idea for the 'special' meeting in 3 weeks, we want
to give lot of time to the main presenter.

But, next 'usual' meeting should be in July, this is a very great idea :)

Thanks!

Subject: [ OWASP - Montreal ] How to manage SSN securely ?
Message-ID: <000901c9ab07$3990ee10$acb2ca30$@ca>

Hi,

 

I would like to know if it exist a regulation and/or law related to SSN
management in a software application (Canada, US) ?  

 

I know the best way to manage SSN is to not store them in a database like
credit card number.  To not persisting them in the database is not a problem
for me, but I have to ask the SSN to my user and then use it in a
third-party Web Service call. 

 

How can I ensure the privacy of this information during the transfer between
the UI and the external web service?

 

We have SSL everywhere to secure the communication.

 

Thanks,

 

S?bastien.

Subject: [ OWASP - Montreal ] Watcher : new web-app security testing and
	compliance auditing tool
Message-ID: <d2def0b60903291921x4a88be39q2b5d960899075a33@mail.gmail.com>

Hello guys,

There is a new web-app security testing and compliance auditing tool
in town. It is a bit like ratproxy (passive and non-intrusive). I
didn't test it much yet, but it seems very pretty interesting for a
first release. Anyone tried it?

>From the site :

Watcher is designed as a Fiddler plugin that passively monitors HTTP/S
traffic for vulnerabilities. It gives pen-testers hot-spot detection
for user-controlled inputs, open redirects, and other issues, and it
gives auditors an easy way to find PCI compliance and other
organizational issues. Here?s some of the issues Watcher has checks
for now:

Cross-domain stylesheet and javascript references
User-controllable cross-domain references
User-controllable attribute values such as href, form action, etc.
Cross-domain form POSTs
Insecure cookies which don?t set the HTTPOnly or secure flags
Open redirects which can be abused by spammers and phishers
Insecure Flash object parameters useful for cross-site scripting
Insecure Flash crossdomain.xml
Insecure Silverlight clientaccesspolicy.xml
Charset declarations which could introduce vulnerability (non-UTF-8)
User-controllable charset declarations
Dangerous context-switching between HTTP and HTTPS
Insufficient use of cache-control headers when private data concerned
(e.g. no-store)
Potential HTTP referer leaks of sensitive user-information
Information leaks in the URL (email address, sessionId, etc)
Source code comments worth a closer look
Insecure authentication protocols like Digest and Basic
SSL certificate validation errors
SSL insecure protocol issues (allowing SSL v2)
Weak authentication protocols
Unicode ill-formed byte streams
more?.
