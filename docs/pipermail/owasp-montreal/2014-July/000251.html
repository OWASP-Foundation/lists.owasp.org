OWASP Montreal - July 24th - Web security for DevOps: the glory is in
the headers

MAIN PRESENTER: Jonathan Marcil

ABSTRACT: DevOps is a buzzword which can be easily demystified: in
essence it is a process which aims to combine the development and system
administration process into one; Operations. As developers become
responsible for server setup, security counter measures are evolving as
well. The line between server configuration and application behaviour
has been blurred. In this talk we will cover some HTTP headers in
regards to security such as CORS, CSP and HSTS. We will demonstrate
several forms of attack, and how they can (should) be countered.

BIO: Jonathan is devoted to security and specialized in Web application
security. His main occupation is consulting in Web security, but deep
down he is a developer with a agnostic vision of programming languages.
He has a diploma in Software Engineering from Ecole de Technologie
Superieure and more than 10 years of experience in Information
Technology and Security.

WHEN: At noon on July 24th 2014

WHERE: 75 Queen Street, office 3100, Montreal, QC H3C 2N6
REGISTRATION: You can join us on site for a pizza slice but this is
mainly an online event. Contact <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-montreal">jonathan.marcil at owasp.org.</A>
