Subject: [ OWASP - Montreal ] Interesting Clickjacking on Twitter today
Message-ID: <A6D736AC-D921-4436-A74F-973F8E4F1764@caedmon.net>

http://www.umoor.eu/blog/yes-we-can.php

The page loads an iframe that prepopulates the twitter status form,  
repositions the frame, and makes it transparent (and positions it in  
the z-index above the button). When the user clicks the button,  
they're actually clicking the iframe, which clicks the button ON  
twitter, bypassing the CSRF protection. Nice (-:

Simplest solution: twitter shouldn't allow the form to be populated  
from the URL.

Discuss. (-:

I think another option to consider is to use the following Frame
Protection approach (from www.digitalroom.net/javascript/frame.html ):
   1. Detecting whether or not page has been loaded within its frameset.
   2. Redirecting or reloading the page so that it loads itself within
its intended frameset.

Agreed. They tried and failed to do that the first time, but looks  
like they've succeeded by blanking the page if it's within a frameset,  
now.
This approach seems like a bit of an arms-race to me, though.

The real problem is that the browser will pass events to transparent  
(or semi-transparent) objects. I can't think of an actually good  
solution to this problem, offhand (other than to use NoScript with  
clickjacking detection).

It was an amazing meeting, I learned many things and I meet a lot of great
persons.

 

Here?s what I would like to learn in the upcoming meetings:

 

1-     Threat Modeling -> How to and Best Practices

2-     How to use OWAPS WebScarab Tool

 

Thanks and see you soon,

Hello everyone,

I agree with Sebastien, both presentations were incredible! I
especially enjoyed the SDL-IT presentation since it was full of good
advices.

Threat Modeling is new to me and I would also appreciate to learn more
on this matter.

Thank you!

Hi,

 

At the yesterday meeting, someone has asked about a tool for code review
management.

 

Here?s the link : http://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible/

 

Is not a free tool but Its look very promising... I didn?t try myself, so I
cannot told you more about this tool.

Hi All,

>From my understanding the main issue pointed by this guy about tool for code
review was managerial and not technical.
MM (man-months) calculation spent for specific project review is not covered
by "standard" code review tools and this is what he's working on it right
now. You still need use another tool for PM in addition to code review tools
to cover it.


Sincerely,
Dan

Hi,
Being a student at Concordia University, i got this incredible oppurtunity
to attend OWASP-Montreal meeting.
Both the presentations were excellent and i could relate it to my Masters
studies!
I am doing a survey on Top 10 2007 - OWASP for the course project.
So it was incredibly great!
And i thank Mr.Benoit Guerette and Mr.Rob Labbe for the presentation.

Thanks,
Arun

My question was sort of  managerial and technical. It was about
techniques to optimize the Management of a Source Code review.
 
While there is many tools to analyze code, there is very few tools that
keep track of what you are doing. I work on source code review projects
containing sometime over a million lines of code. So far I have found no
good tools that would help me easily keep track of what I am doing, so I
have my own internal tools to do it but I am looking into what other
people are doing to solve theses problems and also what are the problem
they are facing so that I can find solution for them and integrate them
in my tools.

If I record everything I am doing in a Excel sheet, it 'double' the time
it take me and it's still very hard to make sense of the excel sheet
anyway(been there done that). Many Source Code reviewer work with Excel
sheet, but it just make no sense for me.

What I want to know:
Which modules I have looked at and how long I looked at them, at which
dates and times I looked at them.
Which modules I found issue in.
Mark the type of functionality in the different part of the code so that
I can link those part of code into the Threat Model easily and
prioritize code to be audited based on Call Graph and Risk.

And I want to do that in a transparent way so that I don't have to get
my focus out of the code to update a huge Excel sheet.

So basically I want a Audit Trail of what I am doing while looking at
the code, analyze the patterns, generate statistic and detect which part
of the code I neglected to take better decision on which part of the
code I should priorize next. If you realised that at this date I did't
find anything in any of the code,  You can push those part of the code
to be  reviewed again later or you cross reviewed the code at a other
date and find stuff, you can establish that you where not at your prime
when reviewing some part of the code and that this code need to be
looked at again by you or by a other auditor.

A other key issue is I need my coworker to be able to monitor what I am
doing so that we don't duplicate work and that if I find a module more
fragile they also double check that module.

Most tools are geared toward Automated Code Review, while those tools
are very good at finding some type of bugs, they have epic fail finding
bug in some other category. There is very few tools that will help the
reviewer to manage his manual code review, and if you have a millions
line of code to look at, you need all the help you can.

Finding 1 needle in a hay stack  is easy, when there is a unknown random
number of needles and you have to attempt to catch them all it become
very difficult. Most company don't invest as much as Microsoft to audit
their source code, so as a code reviewer you need to manage your time
very well so that it's optimized into finding as much critical bugs as
possible and have a great ROI.

I will actually be presenting in a few month on Web Application Review
at RSI in Montreal( http://www.colloque-rsi.com/detail_conf.php?id=402).

Overview:

Rich Internet Application (RIA) frameworks are seeing an enormous growth in
popularity - technologies like Ajax and Flash create nearly unlimited
opportunities to expand and improve the web user experience. They also bring
with them a host of new security risks. The popularity of these frameworks
among application developers insures that we'll see more attacks and issues
in the months and years ahead.

Join Black Hat Founder and Director Jeff Moss and his guests Billy Hoffman
of HP and Alex Stamos of iSec for a lively discussion of new issues and
security implications in the world of Rich Internet Applications.

Hello.

Is there any public website, vmware image, livecd or any other way to
test our skills or new tools against a test website?

There is webgoat, but I am looking for other ways to do this.

Thanks!

Hey,

I just found this Linux distro today. It's called "damnvulnerablelinux",
here's the website : http://www.damnvulnerablelinux.org/

Haven't got the chance to try it out yet, but i'll surely do when i have
some time.

Thanks Philippe! It it very simple to use, and have both webapp and
network/system vulnerabilities.

I used in with vmware player, using a dumb vmx file to load up the iso file.

Otherwise, you can try the "hackme" series from foundstone. Stuff like
hackme casino and all.. it is a bit harder than webgoat.
