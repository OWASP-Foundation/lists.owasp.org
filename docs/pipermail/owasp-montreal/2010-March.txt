Subject: [ OWASP - Montreal ] Did you try the new google skipfish web
	scanning tool?
Message-ID: <8033bcc31003231915r6fb8f01bkc2f7accb95c40704@mail.gmail.com>

I am curious to get feedback from other users... Up to date it seems great,
and the report are very good compared to nikto/wikto and other tools (also
contain a trace with every alert).

It seems to generate a lot of traffic so I am playing with the parameters to
get a shorter scan.

Thanks!
