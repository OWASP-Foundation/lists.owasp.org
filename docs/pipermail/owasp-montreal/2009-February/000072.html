Black Hat Webcast No. 8
Rich Internet Application Security
Thursday, February 26 1:00 pm PST/4:00 pm ET &#8226; FREE
Speakers:

    * Jeff Moss, Founder and Director of Black Hat
    * Billy Hoffman, HP
    * Alex Stamos, iSec

Overview:

Rich Internet Application (RIA) frameworks are seeing an enormous growth in
popularity - technologies like Ajax and Flash create nearly unlimited
opportunities to expand and improve the web user experience. They also bring
with them a host of new security risks. The popularity of these frameworks
among application developers insures that we'll see more attacks and issues
in the months and years ahead.

Join Black Hat Founder and Director Jeff Moss and his guests Billy Hoffman
of HP and Alex Stamos of iSec for a lively discussion of new issues and
security implications in the world of Rich Internet Applications.
