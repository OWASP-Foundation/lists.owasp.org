Subject: [ OWASP - Montreal ] PHP 5.1 vs 5.2 security fix
Message-ID: <8033bcc30906190703x3881aafbk83294d6527fe5be5@mail.gmail.com>

I have a question for the PHP peoples here

On some linux plateforms, last binary version of PHP available is
5.1.6, august 2006.

But, last version of PHP is 5.2.9 (release yesterday)

Should I consider the last version of 5.1 as free of vulnerability,
and it would be updated if any vulnerability is found in the current
version, or it is not working like that, only the current version is
supported?

So is there multiple branch supported, or only the last version is supported?

Here CVE tell me that a fix in 5.2.x fix a security issue in lot of
version of php. So I guess that 5.1.6 is vulnarable, and any server
should be updated to 5.2.10.

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2872

Thanks

5.2.10 was released yesterday.

Only 5.2 is getting official attention right now. 5.3 will be released  
"soon" and 6.0 is in the works. 5.1 is not officially supported by  
php.net.

Right now, only 5.2. 4.4 might also be supported, but you shouldn't be  
using it anyway (-:
However, your DISTRO might be backporting fixes from 5.2 to 5.1.
It depends on your particular platform.
I always compile my own PHP.

Thanks Sean.

Where can I see that 5.1 is not officially supported by php.net (for
my personal knowledge)?

Here is the php package installed on the server, where can I confirm
that they are backporting fixes from 5.2 to 5.1?

Currently, it needs to be inferred from http://php.net/downloads.php  
(there's no mention of 5.1), but I've asked the doc team to make it  
more explicit. They agreed, so it should be forthcoming (-:

A way to see if the patches are backported is to check the rpm
history, as Redhat lists the CVE it has patched for. It's no silver
bullet but it will give you a better idea.

http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-find-out-patch-can-cve-applied/

Also, to enhance the security of PHP, consider installing the suhosin
patch by Stefan Esser. This is one of the guys behind "The Month of
PHP Bugs" initiative.
