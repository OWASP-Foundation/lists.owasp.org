UQAM takes only one U. I'll put that on the privation of sleep ;-)
Anyways that competition was really cool. And the ETS team really
rocked the place with their Windows domain takeover.

Hi!

Do you think that all sql injections vulnerabilities are exploitable?
Do you have an
example of a non-exploitable sql injection vulnerability?

Cracking a password in brute force mode is only a question of time (in
general), but:

exploiting a sql injection, is it also a question of time, so when you
find one, all time spent is an investment that will lead to success?

Thanks!

Hello Gueb,

It depends on your definition of "exploitable" and "success".

A vulnerability can be exploited, but there could be mitigating
factors (i.e. security controls) that could lead to very small gains
from an attacker point of view. For example, if the database user has
very limited rights and an sql injection vulnerability is exploited,
the attacker might not find what he was looking for.

I hope this answer your question!

In fact this question applies to every technique. Like Martin said,
you need to determine what this vulnerability allows you to do and
sometimes it won't allow you much so won't be able to "exploit" it.
That being said, if such a vulnerability is found it should be fixed
because new techniques are constantly arising and changes in future
updates of the software you are attacking might make that
vulnerability exploitable.

Hope that helped.

Sorry guys, I forgot a couple of details to clarify my question :)

- My question was more on the attacker point of view, not the victim
- I am also considering that the victim is not a secure mind sysadmin, so
everything is running under root, and database running with admin
privileges.
- So the door is wide open

With those conditions, you are in front of a SQL injection vuln, with no
monitoring to block you, no IPS, no problem :

- Every minute spent is an investment? Be patient, analyse, you will find a
way to exploit the vulnerability?

Message-ID: <cfc32c5e0904081434n5388dca4o6a80a86366197d54@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
First of all , I would like to thank OWASP Board members for arranging
wonderful presentation yesterday.

 I am trying to implement a XSS vulnerablity scanner for PHP code as my
course mini project.
The scanner should scan single php file and produce vulnerable lines as the
output.
Can you give some idea like which language supports php parser to start
with.


Thanks,
Arun

Hello Arun,

Pixy is a xss and sql scanner for php.It's made in Java and it is well
documented.
You can learn how they parsed the php in their technical report :
http://www.seclab.tuwien.ac.at/papers/pixy_techreport.pdf

Website : http://pixybox.seclab.tuwien.ac.at/pixy/index.php

Good luck with your project!

Hi Martin,Thanks for your prompt reply.
I made a small c# application which reads a vulnerable php program (with no
input validation) , and i check for $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST values and i
validate them for XSS vulnerabilities (for now) by appending a input
validation code to the vulnerable code through c# program. Now every  $_GET,
$_POST, $_REQUEST  value , goes through this check .
So basically a programmer types a vulnerable source code in the c#
application , and he gets back a secure code.

Can you give me more ideas to improve my c# application.

Thanks,
Arun

There is lot of pages on Google about this, but I am asking your personal
opinion.

Lot of peoples are saying that CAPTCHA are easy to defeat, so in a pen
testing process, do you allow lot of time to challenge a CAPTCHA?

Is it worth the time?

Hi Benoit,

Rafal Los in his presentation at OWASP Montreal has mentioned that IE8
has issues in regards to same-origin policy. I was googling for it
without success. There was some references related to it in early
betas.  We are planning to introduce IE8 and we are looking at
potential issues.

Can you point me to the right source?

Thank you,

For this, look at PHP Tokenizer, it's the best way to implement it...

Did someone say tokens?! (-;

I have a pet project called the Tokalizer that helps make the PHP  
tokenizer's output usable:
http://github.com/scoates/tokalizer

(I just moved it to github last night, and I'm a git newbie, so expect  
some instability (-; The code is also pretty young, but it does cool  
stuff (like context-sensitive diffing and grep))

Also, there's parsekit, which we use for an internal vulnerability  
tester (and I seriously need to build a release soon):
http://pecl.php.net/parsekit

Some info on our internal tool (uses parsekit) here:

</plug> (at least it was on-topic (-; )

Hi everyone,

On my preceding message about CodeFest 3.0, there was a project call 
OWASP Validation Testing Framework.

This framework doesn't exist for the moment, but I want to use the 
codefest to begin working on the project.

The project is an addition to ESAPI, in a way.

So lets me explain it.

WHAT?

It's a framework that will help generate unit testing files, usually for 
Validator/Filter fonction.

Some config files will have differents tests, for differents datatype, 
and using a generator, it will produce testing using differents 
templates for differents unit testing framework.

So by exemple, we will produce date test for email, phone numbers, URL,  
ect.

Generator could do files for differents framework like jUnits, phpUnits, 
SimpleTest, phpt, lime...

So if a project, use phpUnits, and have a validator for email, it could 
generate test for it.

WHY?

So many validators or filters, have flaws, because programmers don't 
understand all concepts of a format, or concept of security, so many 
accept (ie for email) thing like :
*** The next to line are one attack line, with a return (or line jump) 
into it ***
myemail at site.com
to: spam at site.com

So now we have a header injection in a email.

or do you know that this address is valid?

me\@mysite.com at site.com

But who many validators will reject it? 80%? More?

WHO can help?

Anyone that is at least one of those :

 * You did a validator in any languages
 * You understand some formats that need validation
 * You're using a unit testing framework
 * You're a programmer
 * You're a Pen Tester
 * You would like to help on :
  * Making the testing configuration (YAML)
  * Making the unit testing template
  * Making the generator (in PHP, but others languages implementations 
could be done after)
  * Documentation

WHEN :

During CodeFest 3.0




A working prototype should be finish during this weekend.  The framework 
will be offer to OWASP.  I really want it to be a official project, but 
having prototype, and betters documentations will help.
