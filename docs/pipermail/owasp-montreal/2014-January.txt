OWASP ISO IEC 27034 Application Security Controls Project

OWASP ISO/IEC 27034 Application Security Controls Project is an effort
to do the conversion of OWASP related documentations and best practices,
such as the OWASP Top 10, in Application Security Controls (ASCs) as
defined in ISO/IEC 27034. This will enable 27034 stakeholders to use
formal structure of OWASP content.

Working sessions are in preparation and will be held in English in
Montreal and accessible worldwide with Hangouts!
