PHP-Qu?bec, Montr?al-Python, Ruby Montr?al, W3Qc, and OWASP Montr?al  
are organizing the first edition of the ConFoo.ca conference, which  
will be held in Montr?al on March 10th through 12th at the Hilton  
Bonaventure Hotel.

ConFoo.ca is looking for the great speakers willing to share their  
experience and skills with programmers, managers, marketers and  
decision makers. The conference will be divided into two parts:

A technical part, encompassing different aspects of Web development:
PHP, Python, Ruby, security, project management, CMSs and
frameworks, databases, systems administration, Web standards,
accessibility and agile methods.

A decision-making part: referencing (SEO), Web marketing analysis,
and social networking.

Presenters can decide to present in English or French.  Presentations  
are going to be roughly one hour long and these may be recorded for  
later broadcast in digital format.  All relevant details concerning  
the conference are available on the call for speaker website [1].

Security ain't an orphan child at the conference. We are one of the  
first web development with a complet security track.

Share the word!
