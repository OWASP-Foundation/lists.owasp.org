Hi everyone,

thanks to confidence I've been given by this nomination from the board.

As the chapter leader of OWASP Montreal, I'll try my best to fill up
2013 agenda with continuous events and bring new activities than the
presentations the way we are used to. I'm talking about workshops on
OWASP or other open projects, community mash-up in Montreal, including
international speakers and doing the talks in many places including
online events.

That said, I'm now in the process of looking around to see what is
possible. So, if you fall into one of the categories bellow and would
like to give a little help to OWASP Montreal, please send me an email at
jonathan.marcil at owasp.org :

- Student or teacher in security or plain computer science
- Business that is involved in Web activities in general or security
- Sponsor who would like to contribute directly to a quality talk
- Board member of any related community around Montreal

This is not a call to be on our board or even to become a member, but
more to poke around to see who's interested in OWASP Montreal.

I'll try to connect with many people as possible and then work with
them and the board in order to support OWASP events in 2013.

Thank you all,

- Jonathan Marcil
  OWASP Montreal Chapter Leader
