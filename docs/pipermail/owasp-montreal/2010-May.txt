Subject: [ OWASP - Montreal ] Looking for a .NET secure coding specialist
Message-ID: <AANLkTilkqQVyTjQV7BgB89h-JHd_qjpDqmBsdADYOzXI@mail.gmail.com>

Someone contacted me via my OWASP email found on the OWASP Montreal
site. He found vulnerabilities, related to the OWASP Top Ten, in his
application and he need advice or help to fix the issues.

We have a lot of PHP specialist on the list, but if .NET and secure
coding are your passions (or you know a specialist), please reply to
me in private.

Thanks!
