Title: Evolution of Malware and Defense From an Enterprise Infrastructure Perspective
----------------------------

Abstract: 
The security market space is a flood of attack detection, prevention, reporting, and recovery tools and appliances.  Each targets one or more technical, legal or procedural risk areas, and most tend to make far reaching promises.  This talk will take the audience past the hype, through the real-world experiences of how some of these tools make or break their promises, and how they can be realistically combined to create a meaningful security monitoring program.  The presenter will then share how the attacks evolve to avoid detection, and how the security tools and practice similarly evolve to continue to be effective.
