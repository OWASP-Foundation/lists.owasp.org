OWASP Montreal - June 18th - Gaps in the Clouds

   - *MAIN PRESENTER:* Robert Fritz
   - *ABSTRACT:* Cloud technology offers agility and scaling, and a chance
   to break away from legacy IT choices. Unfortunately, skipping traditional
   IT activities often results in poorly patched systems, out of date
   firewalls, and overprovisioned entitlements wielded by admins whose &#8220;day
   job&#8221; is development. Boundaries of accountability and responsibility
   amongst cloud providers and consumers are confusing, vague, and shift,
   making security difficult to manage. In such an environment, a &#8220;BP-spill&#8221;
   event, where cost wins over safely safety, is likely. This talk will dive
   down into the cracks between the layers of cloud, and share some of the
   exciting dirt we have seen and expect to see in coming years.&#8221;
   - *BIO:* Robert Fritz has been practicing security his entire career.
   Rob started as an Air Force lieutenant at Langley AFB and later at the
   Pentagon in Washington DC, building and managing classified networks.
   Finding he was getting too far from technology after a brief stint flying,
   he left the military to get back to the tech, and built security tools for
   HP in their HP-Unix lab. Over time he found himself in more and more
   security design discussions, so co-authored HP&#8217;s Commercial Application
   Threat Analysis Methodology, building an internal consulting practice at
   HP. This quantitative approach, led to two pending patents, an
   external-facing consulting practice, and his contributions to NIST IR-7502,
   the Common Configuration Scoring System (CVSS follow-on). He is the former
   lead editor for the Center for Internet Security&#8217;s HP-UX Benchmark, and
   current lead for the Android Benchmark. Robert now works for Morgan Stanley
   as global head of the Strategic Consulting team in the Security
   Architecture group, and leads the team&#8217;s cloud and social-media security
   practices.
