OWASP Java Encoder Project
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/7d3680ebcc/d1ed10e149/93bfc499c9>

The OWASP Java Encoder is a Java 1.5+ simple-to-use drop-in
high-performance encoder class with no dependencies and little baggage.
This project will help Java web developers defend against Cross Site
Scripting! The OWASP Java Encoder library is intended for quick contextual
encoding with very little overhead, either in performance or usage. To get
started, simply add the encoder-1.1.1.jar, import org.owasp.encoder.Encode
and start encoding.

For more information, please contact the Project Leaders, Jeff Ichnowski
<jeff.ichnowski at gmail.com> and Jim Manico <jim.manico at owasp.org>
New OWASP Projects

OWASP Faux Bank

Faux Bank has all 10 of the top vulnerabilities implemented, as well as
fixes for these vulnerabilities. The idea is that developers can see a
real-world system with vulnerabilities, so that they can see what to look
for and how to write secure code. The OWASP Faux Bank wiki page can be
found here.

OWASP Store Sheep Project

OWASP Store Sheep is a work in progress application do demonstrate security
concepts relating to Windows Store Apps. Store Sheep is a training app for
Developers wishing to learn to securely code a Windows Store ('Metro
Style') App, and Testers wanting to learn to test one. It contains a number
of security vulnerabilities with explanations and fixes for them. The
project page for the OWASP Store Sheep project can be found here. For more

OWASP SonarQube Project

OWASP Sonarqube Project consist to deliver a set of "standard" profile for
security, like OWASP Top10 profile, ASVS profiles, PCI-DSS profile,ISO
27034ASC profile, ....who can be used by team with the support of OWASP
Community. More than 20 programming languages are covered through plugins
including Java, C#, C/C++, PL/SQL, Cobol, ABAP. The OWASP SonarQube Project
is looking to expand the offered languages, and is looking for language
experts in .NET, PHP and any other language. The project page for the OWASP

OWASP URL Checker

OWASP URL Checker is an open source scrip-table tool to scan websites for
URL's which may lead to information divulging, exploits and common attack
patterns. This tool will check a user defined website for potentially
exploitable/ vulnerable URL's by comparing them against the URL extensions
in the database. The project page for the OWASP URL Checker can be found
here.

Project Announcements

OWASP Security Shepherd New Version

The new version of the OWASP Security Shepherd Project was released earlier
this month. The project now has 50 lessons and challenges based on risks
from both the Top Ten Mobile and Web App Security Risk lists. OWASP
Security Shepherd is perfect for those who are looking to learn about
appsec for the first time or are well seasoned in the arts of pen-testing
and are looking for a challenge.

More information can be found ON THE WIKI PAGE
<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/7d3680ebcc/d1ed10e149/cee13b753d>

Research Assistant Needed for the Developer guide

The Developer Guide Project is looking for an honors student or masters
student to replicate the 1979 paper by Morris and Thompson. It has been
many years since we've had statistically sound research into the basic
properties of the password. Morris and Thompson introduced countermeasures
that we still use today (30 day password rotation, min six character
passwords) that made sense for a PDP 11/870 back in 1979. The project
leaders would like a cryptographer research student or masters student to
help look into session tokens, particularly RESTful API tokens. The basic
topic would be a short paper on the necessary properties to protect against
session prediction, session recovery, side channel attacks against
sessions, and investigate a few sample session issuers, such as RESTful API
in common use.

If you are interested in helping the Developer Guide, please contact Andrew
van der Stock <vanderaj at owasp.org>.

New Set of Architectural Security Principles

The Reverse Engineering and Code Modification Prevention project has
released a set of architectural security principles that enforce integrity
preservation in mobile apps. This is an updated list of principles /
controls that security architects will find useful when enforcing code
integrity within their mobile apps.

For the complete list of the integrity controls and underlying security
principles, check out the Architectural Principles sub-project.

New Dependency Check Version 1.2.3 Out Now

On June 28th, the OWASP Dependency Check released version 1.2.3. Dependency
Check can be used to analyze an applications dependent libraries (Java and
.NET) to identify and report on any known, published vulnerabilities
related to the libraries being used. The tool will be demoed during the
Black Hat Arsenal in Las Vegas on Wednesday, August 6th.

       [image: communication]  Governance Request for Comment: Committees
2.0 Structure

The model outlined below represents a potential implementation of the idea
currently being described as OWASP Committees 2.0. We aim to leverage the
lessons learned from our previous committee model to create a new model
that grows our leadership circles and empowers our leaders for more rapid
action, while still ensuring that their activities stay true to OWASP?s
core values. It is still a work-in-progress, but represents the
contributions from the OWASP Board, the OWASP Executive Director, OWASP
Staff, Dinis Cruz, Johanna Curiel, and various others.

This is your opportunity to have a voice in the future of OWASP governance.
We look forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.

Initiatives

OWASP Winter Code Sprint

We are thrilled to announce the launch of OWASP Winter Code Sprint (OWCS)
for this upcoming Autumn/Winter (Sept 14-March 15).

*What is OWCS?*

The OWCS is a program to involve students with Security projects. By
participating in OCWS a student can get real life experience while
contributing to an open source project and getting university credits.

*How it works*

Any OWASP project that will give you university credits can participate in
OCWS. Each project will be guided by an OWASP expert along with a
professor. Students are graded by their University, based on success
criteria identified at the beginning of the project.

Projects are focused on developing security tools. It is required that the
code any student produces for those projects will be released as Open
Source. Universities are free to specify their own requirements to
projects, such as written reports. OWASP does not influence the way grades
are allocated. The OWASP advisers will provide any information professors
need in order to grade their students.

*How to participate?*

As a Student:

   1. Review the list of OWASP Projects currently prticipating in OWCS
   2. Get in touch with the OWASP Project mentor of your choice
   3. Agree on deliverables with OWASP mentor and university professor
   4. Work away during Autumn/Winter 2014
   5. Rise to Open Source Development Glory!

As a Professor:

   1. Review the list of OWASP Projects currently prticipating in OWCS
   2. Get in touch with the OWASP Project mentor of your choice
   3. Promote the participating OWASP Projects among students
   4. Review student progress with help from OWASP mentors
   5. Grade student work according to university scoring system
   6. Provide student grade results to OWASP mentor/s

OWASP Montreal - July 24th - Web security for DevOps: the glory is in
the headers

MAIN PRESENTER: Jonathan Marcil

ABSTRACT: DevOps is a buzzword which can be easily demystified: in
essence it is a process which aims to combine the development and system
administration process into one; Operations. As developers become
responsible for server setup, security counter measures are evolving as
well. The line between server configuration and application behaviour
has been blurred. In this talk we will cover some HTTP headers in
regards to security such as CORS, CSP and HSTS. We will demonstrate
several forms of attack, and how they can (should) be countered.

BIO: Jonathan is devoted to security and specialized in Web application
security. His main occupation is consulting in Web security, but deep
down he is a developer with a agnostic vision of programming languages.
He has a diploma in Software Engineering from Ecole de Technologie
Superieure and more than 10 years of experience in Information
Technology and Security.

WHEN: At noon on July 24th 2014

WHERE: 75 Queen Street, office 3100, Montreal, QC H3C 2N6
REGISTRATION: You can join us on site for a pizza slice but this is
mainly an online event. Contact jonathan.marcil at owasp.org.
