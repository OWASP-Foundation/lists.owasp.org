Meanwhile at Summer Cottage: Nothing to do while waiting for that rain to end ?

Check out the OWASP Juice Shop project as well as the Companion Guide
"Pwning OWASP Juice Shop" and have some geek quality time while
learning by doing (e.g. install the Docker version of the Shop and get
a taste of Docker as well).
