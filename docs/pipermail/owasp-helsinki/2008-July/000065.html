<PRE>Hello everyone.

I would like to take this moment to thank everybody who have attended
our meetings this year. Special thanks goes to ISACA, RWSUG, FISA and
CERT.FI who have given us a change to spread awareness of application
security.

In last meeting CERT.FI asked little bit of help from OWASP Helsinki.
They would like to translate some parts of OWASP Top Ten to Finnish
and also maybe gather some links to best practices that are already
available through OWASP pages. Anyone who wants to help in this please
let me know.

Also new ideas are needed for future meetings. There has been talk
about hacker workshop that could be arranged. Also other ideas, themes
and speakers are needed for future meetings. We are going to have a
planning session in August after summer holidays. If you would like to
take part in planning future meetings please let me know.


Have a relaxing summer,

Antti
