Subject: [Owasp-Helsinki] Fuzz test intro & demo in Helsinki 16th April
Message-ID: <C309929A-6C1F-4E29-888A-7118CF4C30BE@iki.fi>

Hello all,

You may be interested in the following session in Helsinki on 16th April - and specifically, if your organisation has developers or testing folks, they should perhaps consider attending.

https://fuzz.eventbrite.com/

Oulu University's Secure Programming Group will give an intro and demo to fuzz testing (fuzzing). This is a test method where large volumes of incorrect or invalid inputs will be fed to programs to find potential security issues. OUSPG are behind Radamsa, the leading free fuzz test system.

This is especially useful if your system has any parts that are implemented in a lower level language (such as C/C++) or use natively compiled libraries to process external data.

Feel free to send the pointer forward.

Cheers,

Antti
