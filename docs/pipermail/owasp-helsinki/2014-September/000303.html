Mobile Security chess board - Attacks &amp; Defense

Mobile application hacking and its security is becoming a major concern in today&#8217;s world specially with BYOD and user&#8217;s jailbreaking/rooting their devices. Scanning and vulnerabilities detections are two major areas for mobile applications in current state. Attacking techniques and exploit delivery on different platform are evolving, protection is even tougher as code base are different. The frequency of release for the mobile application is significantly higher than the web application. It is imperative to scan these applications before loading and launching for different platforms.

OWASP has active project of OWASP Top 10 for Mobile application. Need for an hour is to understand the attack surface, methodology and understanding automation options to perform security review of the mobile applications. Methodology to perform application penetration testing using the free automated tools will be demonstrated along with several different demonstrations on attacking for both platforms along with defense strategies.


OWASP Mobile Top Ten Risks 2014 &#173; The New M10: &quot;Lack of Binary Protection&#8221; Category

- All of the bad things hackers can do to your unprotected mobile apps

Abstract: Recently, there has been a new addition to the OWASP Mobile Top Ten Risks. At AppSec California, OWASP debuted the 2014 list and briefly highlighted examples of threats in the new M10 category.  In this talk, we discuss the new category in much more depth.  This presentation educates the audience about the prevalence of binary risks in both iPhone and Android mobile apps.  We will highlight mobile app risks that relate to this new category, as well as others, and how to leverage particular OWASP Projects for the solution.  By the end of this talk, attendees will have a solid understanding of binary risk and how to begin thinking about solutions to these mobile app risks.

We value the opportunity to bring awareness to this new mobile risk  category, as well as others that have been identified to require binary protection, as a best practice for organizations to prevent and mitigate application-based hacking attacks.
