<PRE>Hello everyone

Here are details of upcoming activities

Meetings
Next meetings will be held on September 10th and November 11th. Mark
these dates on your calenders now!
Theme for September meeting is hacker workshop. November theme is
still unconfirmed.

More details to follow later.

OWASP GOES!
If you have ideas and can even possibly arrange a visit to some
interesting security related organisation or other interesting place,
please let us know about it. Visit to CERT-FI was very interesting and
we need more of those to spread application security awareness.

OWASP and CERT-FI co-operation
June OWASP visited CERT-FI and heard about their activities. Visit was
very interesting and generated possible co-operation opportunities in
application security field. We have provided some links to OWASP
material which will be used to create manuals and other material. If
and when more help is needed I will let you know about it.

Translation of Top Ten
Translation of has begun. Idea is to focus on translating summary
table and explanations, <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007.">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007.</A> A1
XSS vulnerability is under work at the moment. What we need is more
volunteers for the translation. This is our change to show our power
as a community. Pick one on the list and let me know about it. I am
counting on your help here folks.

Have a good weekend,

Antti
