<PRE>Hi everybody,

Next year's activities and themes were discussed and planned in OWASP board meeting on December the 12th. Here's a short summary of what was discussed and decided.

1. We decided to continue the efforts to raise the awareness among university students. Our goal is to have at least two awareness events with students next year.

2. We'll organize a traditional yearly OWASP goes event. This year OWASP goes either to F-Secure, Supo, Estonia or whisky tasting. OWASP has previously visited places like criminal museum, national bureau of investigation, CERT-FI and the national signals museum.

3. OWASP meetings 

Next OWASP meetings will be held on following days:
- 14.2. (6.3. backup date)
- 8.5. (15.5. backup date)
- 11.9. (18.9. backup date)

Suggested topic for 2012 meetings
- the impact of application security to today and future society (cyber warfare, incidents, developer point of view)
- HTML 5
- mobile security
- secure authentication and authorization solutions
- security issues with CA/SSL 
- security of new programming languages

If there's something else that you would like to hear about in an OWASP meeting, or if you want to sponsor an OWASP meeting, just let me know. 

4. OWASP Award

An idea about yearly OWASP award was presented. This could be a nice way of promoting application security awareness in Finland. What do you think?

Petteri
