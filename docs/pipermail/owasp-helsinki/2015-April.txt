Subject: [Owasp-Helsinki] Save the date May 29th for next OWASP meetup
	featuring Troy Hunt
Message-ID: <53DF15FECFFF3A4A9A887E0D9812593563C971B4@EXCH01.nixu.dom>

Hi all,

We are glad to have an international speaker Troy Hunt from Australia starring in the next OWASP Helsinki meeting.

Troy is a keynote speaker in the upcoming OWASP AppSec EU in Amsterdam, and will do his keynote "50 shades of AppSec" + one more topic in Helsinki.

"The AppSec industry is enormously diverse and it only continues to diverge as we put more software into more things with more connections. It?s an industry that?s fluctuating between the sophisticated to the absurd, the intelligent to the primitive and the scary to the outright hilarious. There?s valuable lessons to be taken away from these events and applied in our future security efforts.

In this talk, Troy is going to cover a broad spectrum of what?s happening in our industry ? an entire 50 shades of it in only 45 minutes ? and you?ll get a sense of just how challenging it?s becoming for those of us working in AppSec to keep ahead of the attacks. Troy will cover everything from the social aspects of hacking through to some of the more obscure attacks and the increasing challenges we have as defenders."

We will open the registration and publish the schedule/agenda/location soon, but this is an early announcement for those who are already planning their schedules that far.

Cheers,

Pekka

Abstracts of the presentations:

User Group Presentation 1: 50 Shades of AppSec
The AppSec industry is enormously diverse and it only continues to diverge as we put more software into more things with more connections. It?s an industry that?s fluctuating between the sophisticated to the absurd, the intelligent to the primitive and the scary to the outright hilarious. There?s valuable lessons to be taken away from these events and applied in our future security efforts.

In this talk, Troy is going to cover a broad spectrum of what?s happening in our industry ? an entire 50 shades of it in only 45 minutes ? and you?ll get a sense of just how challenging it?s becoming for those of us working in AppSec to keep ahead of the attacks. Troy will cover everything from the social aspects of hacking through to some of the more obscure attacks and the increasing challenges we have as defenders.

User Group Presentation 2: Hack yourself first: how go on the cyber-offence before online attackers do

The prevalence of online attacks against websites has accelerated quickly recently and the same risks continue to be exploited. However, these are often easily identified directly within the browser; it?s just a matter of understanding the vulnerable patterns to look for.

?Hack Yourself First? is all about developers building up cyber-offence skills and proactively seeking out security vulnerabilities in their own websites before an attacker does. It recognises that we have huge volumes of existing websites that haven?t gone through sufficient security review plus we continue to create new content that even when built with security in mind, still needs testing from the perspective of a cybercriminal.

In this session we?ll look at website security from the attacker?s perspective and exploit common risks in a vulnerable web application. We?ll also explore ways to easily grab credit cards, gain immediate FTP access to thousands of websites, crack password cryptography you think is secure and hijack wifi.
