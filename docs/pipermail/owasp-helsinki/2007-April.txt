Subject: [Owasp-Helsinki] OWASP Hki: Next meeting
Message-ID: <E49CA20335B32141BF21FCFE423116370351604E@esebe103.NOE.Nokia.com>

Hello,

Some details for the next meeting have been posted at:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Helsinki

The topic area will be "SOA, Web Services & XML Security" and timing
Tuesday, June 5th 2007.

If you would like to present or know someone who is knowledgeable in
this subject area, please let me know. I would like to see e.g. a
presentation on practical security issues with web services/XML. The
other slot is still available (or we can have more short ones, if
needed).

If you're interested to attend the meeting, please let me know. There is
limited space available.

Cheers,

Mikko

If you'll need more thorough presentation, FISA (Tietoturva ry) is arranging 
a full day training about this topic. Gunnar Peterson will be the instructor 
  here as well. See www.tietoturva.fi.
