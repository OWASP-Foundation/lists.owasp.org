<PRE>Hi all,

We are glad to have an international speaker Troy Hunt from Australia starring in the next OWASP Helsinki meeting.

Troy is a keynote speaker in the upcoming OWASP AppSec EU in Amsterdam, and will do his keynote &quot;50 shades of AppSec&quot; + one more topic in Helsinki.

&quot;The AppSec industry is enormously diverse and it only continues to diverge as we put more software into more things with more connections. It&#8217;s an industry that&#8217;s fluctuating between the sophisticated to the absurd, the intelligent to the primitive and the scary to the outright hilarious. There&#8217;s valuable lessons to be taken away from these events and applied in our future security efforts.

In this talk, Troy is going to cover a broad spectrum of what&#8217;s happening in our industry &#8211; an entire 50 shades of it in only 45 minutes &#8211; and you&#8217;ll get a sense of just how challenging it&#8217;s becoming for those of us working in AppSec to keep ahead of the attacks. Troy will cover everything from the social aspects of hacking through to some of the more obscure attacks and the increasing challenges we have as defenders.&quot;

We will open the registration and publish the schedule/agenda/location soon, but this is an early announcement for those who are already planning their schedules that far.

Cheers,

Pekka
