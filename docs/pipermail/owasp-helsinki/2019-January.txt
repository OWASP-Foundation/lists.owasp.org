Hello everyone!

Here are the details for the next meeting. This time we have great topics
around secure software development! And as this time our sponsor is
Veikkaus, what could be more natural than to have a live card game
tournament of OWASP Cornucopia? ;)

"OWASP Cornucopia is a mechanism in the form of a card game to assist
software development teams identify security requirements in Agile,
conventional and formal development processes." (
