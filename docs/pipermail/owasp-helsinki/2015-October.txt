Hi,

One more thing, here's the abstract of "Security and "Modern" software Deployment (Rory McCune)":

Software deployment has moved a long way from the ?walk to a shop and buy a physical disk? model that was prevalent in the 90?s. These days entire systems are deployed in the blink of an eye directly from a bewildering array of sources.

At the same time the threats posed by those who might target software developers and deployment ecosystems is increasing as the attacker community grows in size and looks for innovative ways to bypass security measures.

This talk is intended to look at the risk model inherent in the development and deployment models used in modern application development frameworks such as Node.JS and Ruby On Rails, and modern software deployment mechanisms such as Docker and examine specific potential security risks, along with discussion of how they could addressed

Regards,
Pekka
