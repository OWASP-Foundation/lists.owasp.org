Subject: [Owasp-Helsinki] Hackathon info
Message-ID: <CC50F201-BEE5-4F97-B6A5-C33FF53BB6A3@owasp.org>

Hello,

We have published more information about the hackathon. We have already a nice hackathon team, but there are still seats available for those who would like to participate! 

So register directly to me if you feel interested in joining this hackathon! If you have experience of Jenkins, Docker, scripting languages / shell scripting - or some of the security tools we have planned to bundle to the pipeline, you are more than welcome to join! But don't hesitate to contact if you are just interested to come to learn!

On this page there is still the original description:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Helsinki

We will be updating the hackathon page before and after the event, so keep following it if you are interested. We are not posting to this mailing list anymore about this event, but are keeping our twitter account @OWASPHelsinki updated.

As a side note, OWASP chapter board will be   planning the coming chapter meetings on next week, so stay tuned! 

-- Pekka
