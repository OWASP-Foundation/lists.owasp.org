Hi everybody,

I'm pleased to announce that the next OWASP chapter meeting will be held on
October 16th.

Please register at Eventbrite: http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4462882602

Location: Fujitsu offices, Valimotie 16, Helsinki.

Agenda:
18:00 Opening words /Petteri Arola, OWASP chapter leader
18:10 Word from our sponsor /Fujitsu
18:25 Hybrid mobile application security and HTML5 with a focus on
getUserMedia /Mikko Saario, Nokia

Both the mobile scene via ?hybrid? apps and the so-called traditional web
are evolving into the same direction ? are the threats doing the same?
Using mainly Windows Phone 7 (and some Qt) examples and demos, Mikko will
take a look at the security aspects in mobile hybrid apps. The HTML5 demo
will concentrate on some newly mainstreamed technologies such as
getUserMedia.
19:10 Introduction to Oauth 2.0 + demo /Teemu K??ri?inen, Nixu

Teemu gives an introduction about Oauth 2.0 and takes a closer look in:
          - Security aspects
          - Implementation guidelines
          - Comparison of Twitter, Facebook and Google implementations.

20:00 Official program ends and free debate continues (in a location shared
later).

Welcome!

Best regards,

Petteri
