<PRE>Attention all students,

Cyber 9/12 Student Challenge takes place on April 22-23 in Geneva,
Switzerland. Take a closer look below.

Merry Christmas,

Petteri


Dear Colleagues,

We would like your help to get out the word to students (and possible
funders) on the Cyber 9/12 Student Challenge.  We are also looking for
judges, coaches and others to make this year another success.

Entering its third year, the Cyber 9/12 Student Challenge remains the only
student competition devoted to national security policy recommendations for
responses during a major cyber incident. The competition is designed to
offer students, across a wide range of academic disciplines, a better
understanding of the policy challenges associated with cyber conflict.

The European competition will take place *on April 22-23 in collaboration
with the *Geneva Center for Security Policy
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.gcsp.ch/Emerging-Security-Challenges/Events/Cyber-9-12-Student-Challenge">http://www.gcsp.ch/Emerging-Security-Challenges/Events/Cyber-9-12-Student-Challenge</A>&gt;*
in
Geneva, Switzerland*.

The annual event is the &quot;must attend&quot; student event in international
cybersecurity policy. The Cyber 9/12 Student Challenge engages students
with a small group of experts representing various sectors including
government, finance, telecom, and the press. This competition promotes
awareness of cybersecurity policy issues while providing students and
experts an opportunity to network and develop new ideas on the future of
cybersecurity policy.

We would greatly appreciate if all professors could please pass this
information onto your students, post it on bulletin boards, and send to
your colleagues and email distribution lists.

In 2015, the competition will include two events. Besides the European
competition, the Atlantic Council will organize its third annual Student
Challenge in the *United States on March 13-14 at the American University
in Washington, DC*. To contact the organizers email
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-helsinki">Cyber912 at atlanticcouncil.org.</A>

If you are interested in funding the Cyber 9/12 Student Challenge, it is a
unique opportunity for companies to recruit top talent from both technical
and policy fields and a prime branding opportunity. Hosting competitions
both in the US and Europe lets our partners reach markets on both sides of
the Atlantic, position the company as a thought leader in the field of
cybersecurity, and as an important supporter of educational activities in
the field. You can find more information about funding opportunities here
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/files/cyber912/Cyber912Brochure.pdf">http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/files/cyber912/Cyber912Brochure.pdf</A>&gt;.

*What is the Cyber 9/12 Student Challenge?*

Throughout the competition, university students will confront a serious
cyber security breach by composing their ideal cyber policy recommendations
and justifying the decision-making process used to rank priorities. During
the course of the competition, the scenario will continue to evolve,
forcing advancing teams to focus on key priorities during a major
cyberattack. By participating in the competition, students get the unique
opportunity to apply their policy recommendations by briefing real global
experts in cybersecurity. Their performance is evaluated by some of the
world's leading cybersecurity policy experts who will participate.

*Who Can Participate?*

Graduate and undergraduate students from US, European, and international
universities who are interested in the disciplines of cybersecurity policy,
international relations, computer science, law, and other related fields
are invited to apply to compete in teams of three to four individuals.

*How to Participate?*

*Registration for the 2015 competition is now open and competitors, judges,
volunteers, and observes can register**here*
