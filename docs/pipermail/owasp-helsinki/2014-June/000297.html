Dear OWASPers in the north,

NordSec is an annual conference on topics within IT security, which brings together IT security researchers and encourages interaction between academia and industry, especially in the north. This year it takes place in Troms&#248;, Norway, October 15-17.

  <A HREF="http://site.uit.no/nordsec2014/">http://site.uit.no/nordsec2014/</A>

If you (or those you represent) are interested in collaborating with researchers on IT security, or in knowing what IT security researchers in the north are up to, this venue is for you.

If you have an idea or experience of interest to IT security enthusiasts, then the following poster session is a great way to discuss it, start conversation, and present yourself.

Best regards,
Dr. Willard Rafnsson
Chalmers University of Technology

NordSec 2014 - Poster Session - Call for Posters

The NordSec 2014 Poster Session aims at facilitating discussions about research and co-operation between young Nordic researchers and is co-organised by the Swedish IT Security Network for PhD students SWITS and the Norwegian Research School of Computer and Information Security COINS.

Especially PhD students from the Nordic countries are invited to submit poster abstracts describing recent research or ongoing research in progress or experiences in all areas of information security and privacy. Poster abstracts can also summarise work that [has been or] will be published in more detail as a full paper elsewhere.

Submissions should be one to two pages long and use the Springer LNCS format and should not be anonymised. They will be reviewed by the NordSec poster session programme committee and selected poster abstracts will also be published in the NordSec LNCS proceedings.

During NordSec 2014 there will be a poster session for the presentation of all posters, in which the audience can also give their votes for the best poster presentation award. NordSec is held in Troms&#248;, Norway, October 15-17, 2014.

Important dates:
   - 6th July 2014: Deadline for submission of poster abstracts
   - 21st July 2014: Notification
