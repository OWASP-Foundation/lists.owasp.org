*Privacy Seals and Marks, Hannu J?rvinen, Specialist Partner, Attorneys at
Law Borenius Ltd*

The proposed data protection regulation encourages the establishment of
data protection seals and marks in order to enhance transparency and
compliance with the regulation. On the other hand, there are already many
privacy seal schemes available. How will these schemes help organisations
to demonstrate their compliance with the privacy and data protection
obligations?

*Privacy Engineering, Antti V?h?-Sipil?, software security guy, F-Secure
Oyj*

In this talk Antti will discuss various proposals of bringing privacy into
threat modelling and system design. We?ll look at existing literature and
actual enterprise implementations of these activities.

*Privacy Use Cases, Saku Vainikainen, Lead Consultant, Nixu Oyj*

In this talk Saku will discuss about privacy use cases, their impact to
user interface and software development and testing processes.

Welcome!
