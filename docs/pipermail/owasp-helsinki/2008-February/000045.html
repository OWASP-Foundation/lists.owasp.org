<PRE>Hello Everyone,


Sorry about the delay in providing English version of information bulletin.


First some new stuff. You can download the RWUSG presentation from the Helsinki Chapter homepage, <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Helsinki.">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Helsinki.</A>


OWASP Helsinki chapter activities have been roughly planned. The general idea is to raise awareness of application security in IT-community. What we decided to do is to try to find right forums through user groups and other communities and basically give presentations about OWASP and application security.

OWASP Helsinki Chapter meetings.
We have planned to have at least two chapter meetings this spring. Prelimenary dates are 11th of March and 13th of May.
Make reservations for these dates. March 11th meeting theme is going to be web application auditing. More details are published later. On May meeting we might try something new. The idea was to organise a OWASP GetTogether meeting were participants can enjoy relaxing refreshments and and mingle in pleasant surroundings. It would also be nice to have someone do a presentation.



OWASP Goes!

This is a new idea. We are trying to organise a visit to some interesting organisations. This is something new we thought of when trying to think other activities besides chapter meetings. With visits we can make OWASP more known and also get to see some interesting organisations. We have made contact with CERT.FI. If you know any good places to visit please let me know.


Awareness raising through co-operation.

As mentioned above theme for this year is to raise software security awareness in different interest groups. We already have made a presentation in ISACA Finland meeting and RWSUG seminar. Both of these can be downloaded from our chapter homepage. We haven't agreed any further presentations. One target could be tester communities. If anybody knows any good testing forums or user groups please let me know.

Other interesting associations are  Hetky, Sytyke, Tietoturva ry and OWASP Sweden Chapter.

We also could make a presentation in different happenings. There has been talk about trying to possibly get a change to speak at Microsoft Devdays.

If you have any ideas just let me know.


AppSec Europe

OWASP is going to organise application security conference in Belgium in May. Check out the information from here <A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Europe_2008_-_Belgium.">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Europe_2008_-_Belgium.</A> Seminar is divided in two parts. There are two days of training and two days of conference. It would be great idea to held unofficial gathering in the conference. Unfortunately we do not have resources to organise group trip but I can gather contact information if that is wanted.


Other ideas

One idea is to have a round-table session in future meetings. We are trying to gather experts to talk about common subject and audience could also participate in this. If you are interested in participating please let me know.
PCI standard could be one theme for autumn meeting. We could try to get some speakers around this theme.
We also have tried to organise a Mini-seminar. This has not happened yet but we are still trying to see if that is possible in the future. We need sponsors and speakers for this to happen.

Join the fun
Helping hands are always needed. Do you want to influence what OWASP Helsinki is going to be? Let me know if you want to help organising meetings or have ideas how to improve our activities. We are an open community and everybody is welcome.

BR,
Antti
