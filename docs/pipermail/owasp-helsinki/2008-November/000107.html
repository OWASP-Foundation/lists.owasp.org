<PRE>Thank you very much for everybody who attended. Special thank goes for
our speakers, Antti &amp; Jussi. Also I would like to thank Mikko and Timo
for organising this event.

Yesterday we heard about SAFEcode <A HREF="http://www.safecode.org">http://www.safecode.org</A> and
lifecycle of one vulnerability from CERT.FI <A HREF="http://www.cert.fi/.">http://www.cert.fi/.</A>

Also  we discussed about translation of top ten to Finnish. It was
agreed that at the moment we don't aim this to get official status
from OWASP. To get official status we would need to produce a 35 page
document and this seems to be a bit overwhelming at the moment.
However, review is needed and this seems to be going on at the moment.
What was also mentioned that maybe we should try to write short
introductions for different target groups e.g. developers and business
people.

After the meeting we had a planning session in nearby pub. We
discussed about having two meetings on next spring. Exact dates are
still open but first meeting should be around February/March and
second meeting late May with some outdoor activities (Drinks &amp; Such).
Application security awareness raising was also discussed. Startup
firms could excellent audience for spreading knowledge about OWASP and
application security awareness. Another interesting target could be
annual tietoturvatapahtuma. These and other ideas are currently looked
into. If you have any comments or ideas please let me know.


Cheers,

Antti
