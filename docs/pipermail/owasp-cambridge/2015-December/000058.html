<PRE>Dear all

One of the first planned events for 2016 is a joint OWASP/BCS  Mobile and Malware Forensics Day at Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge on Friday 22nd January 2016 10-4

We have two internationally renowned speakers already

years in the Metropolitan Police Service, and 3 in the UK&#8217;s National
Crime Agency).  Most recently, 4 years investigating cybercrime at an international
level - both on the Met&#8217;s Police Central eCrime Unit and then in the
National Crime Agency as a Senior Investigating Officer. He freely
admits that cybercrime represented the steepest learning curve of his
career.

He retired from public service in July 2015 and has now joined The
Shadowserver Foundation - a not for profit, global organisation that is
committed to making the Internet safer.  Upon retirement he became a National Crime Agency Special and remains active in ongoing cybercrime investigations internationally. He has presented Masterclasses at Europol and sits on their Internet Security Advisory Board. He is also a member of the Interpol Global Cybercrime
Experts Group.
