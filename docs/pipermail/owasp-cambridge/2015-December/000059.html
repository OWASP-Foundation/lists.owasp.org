Subject: [Owasp-cambridge] Next Event - Friday 22nd January 2016 joint OWASP Cambridge &amp; BCS Cybercrime Forensics Mobile &amp; Malware Forensics Day


Dear all

One of the first planned events for 2016 is a joint OWASP/BCS  Mobile and Malware Forensics Day at Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge on Friday 22nd January 2016 10-4

We have two internationally renowned speakers already 

Stewart Garrick will be talking about the complexities of Peer to Peer (P2P) Botnet takedowns

Stewart Garrick has completed 30 years experience in Law Enforcement (27 years in the Metropolitan Police Service, and 3 in the UK&#8217;s National Crime Agency).  Most recently, 4 years investigating cybercrime at an international level - both on the Met&#8217;s Police Central eCrime Unit and then in the National Crime Agency as a Senior Investigating Officer. He freely admits that cybercrime represented the steepest learning curve of his career.

He retired from public service in July 2015 and has now joined The Shadowserver Foundation - a not for profit, global organisation that is committed to making the Internet safer.  Upon retirement he became a National Crime Agency Special and remains active in ongoing cybercrime investigations internationally. He has presented Masterclasses at Europol and sits on their Internet Security Advisory Board. He is also a member of the Interpol Global Cybercrime Experts Group.

Kevin Mansell will be talking about emmc flash memory forensics (chip on and chip off techniques) 

Kevin is a leading authority on mobile phone forensics have developed and led courses for the National Centre for High Tech Crime (now part of the College of Policing), represented the UK at Interpol on mobile phone forensics and an international leading figure at conference keynotes on mobile device forensics.

Kevin currently leads his own training and consultancy company specialising in digital forensics for mobile devices.

We will also be looking to be having additional speakers including tutorials on malware reverse engineering and presentations on mobile application security and forensics.

Please reserve a date in your diary and more details in the new year.

Have a good Xmas

Adrian
