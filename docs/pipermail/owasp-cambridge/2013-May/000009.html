*OWASP** **EUROPEAN** **TOUR** **2013 &#8211; Cambridge &#8211; 13th May  2013
Conference in Conjunction with Anglia Ruskin University &#8211; Department of
Computing &amp; Technology (Cambridge)*



The OWASP European Tour objective is to raise awareness about application
security in the European region, so that people and organizations can make i
nformed decisions about true application security risks.  Everyone is free t
o participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available under a free and
open software license.



A series of activities such as free conferences, trainings sessions and
awareness games will be provided by renowned professionals with  the sole
purpose of bringing high-quality content and a comprehensive breadth  of
security topics across the EU region .



Who Should Attend the European Tour?

&#183;         Application Developers

&#183;         Application Testers and Quality Assurance

&#183;         Application Project Management and Staff

&#183;         Chief Information Officers, Chief Information Security Officers,
Chief Technology Officers, Deputies, Associates and Staff

&#183;         Chief Financial Officers, Auditors, and Staff Responsible for IT
Security Oversight and Compliance

&#183;         Security Management and Staff

&#183;         Executives, Mangers, and Staff Responsible for IT Security
Governance

&#183;         IT Professionals Interested in Improving IT Security

&#183;         Anyone interested in learning about or promoting Web Application
Security



OWASP Europe TOUR, is an event across the European region that promotes
awareness about application security, so that people and organizations can
make informed decisions about true application security risks. Everyone is
free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available under a
free and open software license. Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most OWASP
Projects are not widely used and understood. In most cases this is not due
to lack of quality and usefulness of those Document &amp; Tool projects, but
due to a lack of understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's
security ecosystem or in the Web Application Development Life-cycle.



This event aims to change that by providing an insight into the issues of
cybercrime, its impact and detection and a selection of mature and
enterprise ready approaches together with practical examples of how to use
them.



*Background *



OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit
worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of
application software. Their mission is to make application security
visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about
true application security risks.



The Department of Computing &amp; Technology at Anglia Ruskin University is
enhancing its curricula and capabilities in information security following
its successful BSc(Hons) Information Security and Forensic Computing course.




Establishing a joint professional networking group with OWASP concentrating
on aspects of computing and application security is a key part of this
enhancement.  A key aim the department is working towards is developing a
MSc Information Security specialising in Application Security and as part
of this activity looking to develop and a local Information Security
Student Society.

Real Costs of Cybercrime

Ross Anderson (Cambridge University Computer Laboratory)

Following a systematic study of the costs of cybercrime, in response to a
request from the UK Ministry of Defence following scepticism that previous
studies had hyped the problem, each of the main categories of cybercrime we
set out what is and is not known of the direct costs, indirect costs and
defence costs {both to the UK and to the world as a whole. We distinguish
carefully between traditional crimes that are now `cyber' because they are
conducted online (such as tax and welfare fraud); transitional crimes whose
modus operandi has changed substantially as a result of the move online
(such as credit card fraud); new crimes that owe their existence to the
Internet; and what we might call platform crimes such as the provision of
botnets which facilitate other crimes rather than being used to extract
money from victims

directly.

Three Legged Cybercrime Investigation and its Implications

DI Stewart Garrick (Metropolitan Police ECrime Unit)

DI Stewart Garrick has over 27 years experience in the Metropolitan Police
Service, 22 years as a detective and 10 years as a Detective Inspector. His
career has been spent primarily on major crime units engaged on both
proactive and reactive investigations, including 5 years investigating
murders, 3 years on the Homicide Task Force (a proactive unit targeting
those who would commit murder) and 5 years managing covert operations
against organised crime. In March 2011 he joined Scotland Yard's Police
Central eCrime Unit. He has witnessed the PCeU's growth from 40 officers to
over 100 and has managed several high profile investigations. He has
recently taken charge of the unit's cadre of police and civilian forensic
examiners who are integrated into the unit's dynamic investigative model.
He has this year completed an MSc in Countering Organised Crime and
Terrorism at UCL, with a dissertation examining the emergence of
radicalising settings based on Situational Action Theory.

OWASP Top 10 &amp;  Mobile Top 10

Justin Clarke - London OWASP Chapter Leader

The OWASP Mobile Security Project is a centralized resource intended to
give developers and security teams the resources they need to build and
maintain secure mobile applications. Through the project, our goal is to
classify mobile security risks and provide developmental controls to reduce
their impact or likelihood of exploitation.



As part of the overall Mobile Project  , the Top 10 Mobile Risks include



M1: Insecure Data Storage

M2: Weak Server Side Controls

M3: Insufficient Transport Layer Protection

M4: Client Side Injection

M5: Poor Authorization and Authentication

M6: Improper Session Handling

M7: Security Decisions Via Untrusted Inputs

M8: Side Channel Data Leakage

M9: Broken Cryptography

M10: Sensitive Information Disclosure

Everything We Know is Wrong

Eoin Kelly - OWASP Board Member

The premise behind this talk is to challenge both the technical controls we
recommend to developers and also out actual approach to testing. This talk
is sure to challenge the status quo of web security today.



&quot;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different
results.&quot; - Albert Einstein



We continue to rely on a &#8220;pentest&#8221; to secure our applications.

Why do we think it is acceptable to perform a time-limited test of an
application to help ensure security when a determined attacker may spend
10-100 times longer attempting to find a suitable vulnerability?

Our testing methodologies are non-consistent and rely on the individual and
the tools they use.

Currently we treat vulnerabilities like XSS and SQLI as different issues
but the root causes it the same. &#8211; it&#8217;s all code injection theory!! Why do
we do this and make security bugs over complex?



Why are we still happy with &#8220;Testing security out&#8221; rather than the more
superior &#8220;building security in&#8221;?

Tricolour Alphanumercial Spaghetti

Colin Watson - OWASP Project Leader

Do you know your &quot;A, B, Cs&quot; from your &quot;1, 2, 3s&quot;?



Is &quot;red&quot; much worse than &quot;orange&quot;, and why is &quot;yellow&quot; used instead of
&quot;green&quot;?



Just what is a &quot;critical&quot; vulnerability? Is &quot;critical&quot; the same as &quot;very
high&quot;?



How do PCI DSS &quot;level 4 and 5&quot; security scanning vulnerabilities relate to
application weaknesses?



Does a &quot;tick&quot; mean you passed? Are you using CWE and CVSS? Is a &quot;medium&quot;
network vulnerability as dangerous as a &quot;medium&quot; application vulnerability?
Can CWSS help?



What is FIPS PUB 199? Does risk ranking equate to prioritisation? What is
&quot;one&quot; vulnerability?



Are you drowning in a mess of unrelated, classifications, terminology and
abbreviations? If you are a security verifier and want to know more about
ranking your findings more meaningfully, or receive test reports and want
to better understand the results, or are just new to ranking
weaknesses/vulnerabilities and want an overview, come along to this
presentation. It will also explain why the unranked information-only
(&quot;grey&quot; or &quot;blue&quot;?) findings might contain some of the best value
information.
