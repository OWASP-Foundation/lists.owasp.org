Deer All

Sorry for the delay but eventually I've managed to get some of the event details put up on the BCS website with a couple lots of slides.

http://www.bcs.org/content/ConWebDoc/55536

Unfortunately the slides from Stewart's Botnet takedowns is unfortunately not available for public downloading but Stewart is happy to field individual requests.  (Please let me know I'll put you in touch)

I'm chasing Pen Test partners slides as well

Kind regards

Adrian
