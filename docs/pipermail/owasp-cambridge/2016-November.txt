Dear All

Just an early reminder that our next OWASP Cambridge  Chapter Meeting is set for the Tuesday 13th December 2016 5:30 - 8:30 pm

We have 3 brilliant speakers lined up for the evening & Sonatype are kindly sponsoring the refreshments 

We have Ken Munro from Pentest Partners doing what he does best. (Ken is the guy who regularly breaks IoT devices for a living in the National Press to demonstrate just how poorly we build security into devices nowadays.

We have Chris Dye, VP Glasswall who will share how files are being manipulated and show the trends in attacks and techniques that can be deployed to eliminate document based attacks.

Rounding up the evening we have Iikka Turunen from Sonatype delivering a topical talk of Secure DevOps.

In the next few days, I?ll be posting round the official flyer and Eventbrite details.

Look forward to seeing you there 

Adrian

OWASP Cambridge Chapter ?Malevolent Devices, Documents & Development? Security Seminar

Tuesday 13th December  2016 17:30 ? 20:30, Lord Ashcroft Building (LAB002), Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.

Hosted by the Department of Computing & Technology, Anglia Ruskin University, & OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Cambridge Chapter

Refreshments kindly sponsored by Sonatype.

Title: ?Malevolent Devices, Documents & Development"

Guest speaker: Ken Munro, Partner, Pen Test Partners

Abstract: ?The Thermostat, the Hacker, and the Malware"

Following the PoC thermostat ransomware that Pen Test Partners performed at DefCon 24, this presentation digs even deeper into IoT devices and their apps. Staying with the thermostat Ken will walk through the ransomware attack and then move onto general malware - which has no easy method for detection. Even when firewalled these devices are still vulnerable to local attacks so we?ll show you how you can achieve a compromise.

Biography: Ken Munro

Ken is a regular speaker at events such as the ISSA Dragon?s Den, (ISC)2 Chapter events and CREST (Council of Registered Ethical Security Testers), where he sits on the board. He?s also an Executive Member of the ?Internet of Things Security Forum?, a body that aims to promote best security practice and the application of controls in smart device manufacturing, and spoke out on IoT security design flaws at the forum?s inaugural event. He?s also not averse to getting deeply techie, regularly participating in hacking challenges and demos at Black Hat, 44CON, DefCon and Bsides.

Ken has a wealth of experience in penetration testing but it?s the systems and objects we come into contact with on an everyday basis that really pique his interest. This has seen him hack everything from keyless cars and a range of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, from wearable tech to children?s toys and smart home control systems. This has gained him notoriety among the national press, leading to regular appearances on BBC TV and BBC News online as well as the broadsheet press. He?s also a familiar contributor to industry magazines, penning articles for the legal, security, insurance, oil and gas, and manufacturing press.

Guest Speaker: Chris Dye VP Marketing & Communications, Glasswall

Abstract: Prevention is better than cure ? don?t assume opening a business document is risk free!

The security industry?s attempt to defend organisations by classifying known bad e.g. signatures or heuristics, is not succeeding, and the industry has turned its focus from prevention to post infection detection and breach mitigation.

Today?s advanced, targeted cyber-attacks use weaponized files as an attack vector with a huge success rate. File-based threats involve hiding malware or malicious code within a common file-types, such as Word, Excel or PDF files. Conventional security controls such as firewalls, AV, and more advanced dynamic network sandboxes are ineffective in dealing with these types of threats as they only identify known threats or are unsuccessful in identifying exploits in the files. Chris will share how files are being manipulated and show the trends in attacks and techniques that can be deployed to eliminate document based attacks.

Biography: Chris Dye 

Having originally trained in electrical engineering and power generation Chris moved initially into IT recruitment and now has over 30 years? experience of working in IT software and services companies. His career has spanned almost every operational, sales and marketing disciplines including investor relations, company operations, product analysis and design, recruitment, sales and marketing. He is also an experienced training consultant delivering talent development, sales and relationship management programs to commercial and technology companies. An entrepreneur at heart Chris has been involved in Glasswall since the beginning and is now heading up the marketing of its unique and disruptive technology.

Guest Speaker: Ilkka Turunen -Solutions Architect at Sonatype

Abstract: DevSecOps - Security at Devops speed

Software development is pressed for faster and faster release cycles with acceptable quality, budget and security. As movements like CI, CD and Devops aim to cut down on release cycles, it's security's job to help control the risk. The risk landscape is complex as modern development practices increasingly consume more and more third party code. Traditional methods do not cut it anymore - it's time for DevSecOps.

This session gives an overview of how companies have implemented DevSecOps practices in their own delivery pipelines and how this can help increase developer awareness of risks affecting them. We'll walk an example CICD Pipeline and explore how security has been embedded as a part of it, how the movement is shaping up and how standards are starting to follow suite.

Biography: lkka Turunen, Sonatype

Ilkka Turunen is a Solutions Architect working at Sonatype in Europe and Asia. His background is in software and systems engineering, acting as an architect for several commercial projects. He's helped define everything from the software design to web-scale infrastructure architectures and regularly works with companies across the world to understand and improve their software supply chain and continuous delivery pipelines.

Background

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit worldwide charitable organisation focused on improving the security of application software. Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organisations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.

The Department of Computing & Technology at Anglia Ruskin University is enhancing its curricula and capabilities in information security following its successful BSc(Hons) Information Security and Forensic Computing pathway. Establishing a joint professional networking group with OWASP concentrating on aspects of computing and application security is a key part of this enhancement. A key aim the department is working towards is developing a MSc Information Security specialising in Application Security and as part of this activity looking to develop and a local Information Security Student Society.
