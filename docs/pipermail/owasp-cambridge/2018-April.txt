Hi All,

As you might have already heard, AppSec EU has been switched to London for this year.

Obviously this is a recent change, so details are still to be ironed out, but the venue (The Queen Elizabeth Center) and the dates (3rd - 6th July) have been confirmed. The website - https://2018.appsec.eu - is up with some information already.

Not sure when tickets will become available, but the CFP and CFT are up on the website - and London will be looking for volunteers to help!

If anyone is interested in helping/sponsoring/training/speaking and wants to know more drop me a note and I can put you in touch with the organisers. Alternatively you can get them on their OWASP slack channel (sign up via https://owasp.herokuapp.com/).

Thanks,
Daniel
