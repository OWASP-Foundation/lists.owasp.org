Message-ID: <9B2F62E5-A3F4-4888-8A2C-0076C968BE1F@owasp.org>

Dear All

Just to remove any confusion, there is NO chapter meeting tomorrow due to lack of speakers.

At the moment we're planning for a joint OWASP/BCS Cybercrime Forensics SIG Mobile and Malware Forensics Day for the Friday 22nd January.  More details in due course

Thanks

Adrian
