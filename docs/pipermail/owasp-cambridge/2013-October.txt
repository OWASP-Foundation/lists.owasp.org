Subject: [Owasp-cambridge] Next OWASP Cambridge Chapter Meetings
Message-ID: <4B6BE545-C864-41EB-A2F2-70A3AF4C0448@owasp.org>

Dear All

We're planning this years next OWASP Cambridge Chapter meetings and the current thinking is that we'll put on events in early November, early December, early February and early April leading up to AppSec EU Conference in late June.

We're looking provisionally at the Thursday 5th November for our first meeting.  We've Forensics 101 potentially lined up as the first speaker.

Does anyone have any more suggestions for what they would like for future events?  I've got a some possibilities on cybercrime investigation, mobile forensics and cloud security  as well.

More details as they become available.

Many thanks

Adrian

We've now started to fix the dates for out next set of Chapter Meetings with identified speakers.

Our first meeting will be on Tuesday 12th November from 5.30 - 8.30 LAB002 and LAB107 (refreshments)

(Unfortunately we've had to cancel the 5th November as one of our speakers could no longer make the date and potentially congestion due to Firework displays)

The topics and speakers for the presentations will be

Tom Forbes (from the University of Hull) will do an Introduction to Hacking
Paul Cain (from 7Safe) will do an Introduction to Forensics.

Our second meeting will be the 5th December (5.30 - 8.30 provisionally)

The speaker will be Denis Edgar-Neville, Head of Computing at Canterbury Christchurch University, ECENTRE Project Manager,  he will talk about Live Forensics and International Cybercrime Investigations

Our third meeting is likely to be a joint chapter event with KPMG on Tuesday 4th February.  Further details to be determined.

Our 4th event will be on Tuesday 1st April, speakers yet to be determined.

Not forgetting the OWASP AppSec EU 2014 Conference at Anglia Ruskin Monday 23rd June to Thursday 26th June 2014.  Any volunteers greatly received.
