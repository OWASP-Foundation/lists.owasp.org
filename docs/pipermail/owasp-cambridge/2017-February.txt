 Fpr those interested in the Cyber Security innovation side of things or
are part of a SME Cyber related business, the Cambrdge Cyber Policy Securty
cluster is running its next meeting next week.  We have a Senior Cyber
Security Policy Advisor from the UK Government Dept of Culture, Media &
Sport.

IF interested, please follow the regsitration link below

The Cambridge Cyber Security Cluster has been formed, under the umbrella of
the UK Cyber Security Forum, by a number of cyber security focused
organisations in and around the Cambridge (Silicon Fen) & Peterborough area?s
(but also including East Anglia as a whole) including Anglia Ruskin
University <http://www.anglia.ac.uk/> & its Cyber Security Research Team
<https://cyberexchange.uk.net/#/company/anglia-ruskin-university>



The aims of the Cluster are two-fold:-



   - To support the members of the cluster by communicating National and
   International initiatives and trade opportunities, providing a networking
   platform to share ideas and best practice, encouraging collaboration and
   identifying partnership opportunities so that small cyber security
   specialist businesses in the East of England can find new ways to grow.



   - To support the newly proposed devolved Greater Cambridgeshire area and
   the East of England?s commitment to Cyber Security (and UK Government's
   Cyber Security Strategy) by building cyber security knowledge, skills and
   capabilities in the Region, to make businesses more resilient to cyber
   attacks and the East of England Region, one of the most secure places in
   the world to do business.



These meetings are free to attend for any company actively working in Cyber
Security.



If you, as an individual or an organisation, are interested in exploring
what you can offer to support the UK Cyber Security Strategy in East Anglia
then please contact us <http://cams at ukcybersecurityforum.com>.

Hi all,

Firstly on behalf of the Chapter Leaders I'd like to thank all of the
sponsors, speakers and attendees of this last year's OWASP Cambridge events
- we hope you all enjoyed them!  For our two joint day events we held in
Jan this year, we had almost 200 attendees between the events

For the rest of  2017 we are planning on doing 4-6 events - the next of
which is on 7th March We're still looking for speakers and sponsors for
this and future events, so if you've had any great ideas we'd be keen to
hear from you.

As a reminder: our OWASP Chapter events mainly focus on 3 tracks:

 - Builders

As a guideline we invite talks on the following topics (not exhaustive
list):

  * Novel web/mobile vulnerabilities and countermeasures (note: no
zero-days, any vulnerabilities must be responsibly disclosed prior to
presenting at OWASP events)
  * New technologies, paradigms, frameworks, tools
  * OWASP tools or projects - new and existing, best practices and
experience of implementing them in your company
  * Agile Security and Continuous Integration
  * Secure development: frameworks, best practices, secure coding, methods,
processes, standards, SDLC, code review
  * AppSec Pipeline - Automation and Orchestration
  * Threat modelling
  * AI and Machine Learning in Application Security
  * Browser security
  * IoT security and AppSec
  * JavaScript/Node.JS security
  * Mobile security and security for the mobile web
  * Threat Intelligence & AppSec
  * Cloud security, Container security
  * REST/SOAP and API security
  * Security of frameworks
  * Payment Security, PCI impact on AppSec, tools, frameworks, best
practices
  * Blockchain & AppSecurity
  * Cryptography and its use (and abuse) in Mobile and Web Apps
  * Data Privacy, Governance, Data Protection (GDPR)
  * Management topics: Managing Secure Software Development LifeCycle
(SDLC), Managing Application Security initiatives, Developer Training
Incident Response
Digital Forensics, Mobile Forensics
Social Engineering / OSINT
Malware Analysis

Amongst many others

Recommended talk durations up to 45 minutes with additional 15 minutes for
any live demos and Q&A.

If you would like to present a talk at future OWASP Cambridge Chapter
meetings please review and agree with the OWASP Speaker Agreement here:
