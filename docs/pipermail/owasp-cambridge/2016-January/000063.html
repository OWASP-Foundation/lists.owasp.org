Securing the Virtual Organisation
5 April 2016 &#8211; Cambridge, United Kingdom 
  
We are pleased to announce that (ISC)&#178; is bringing its acclaimed Secure Events Series to Cambridge for the first time!
 
Conference Synopsis 
This conference explores the impact of the rise of the virtual organisation on security practice, the solutions that are emerging to tackle this environment, and the lessons being learned within professional practice. Acknowledging the need to step away from the technology-driven approach that often dominates traditional systems security management, delegates will explore the foundational concepts that drive security and still apply in a world that is designed to be much less defined than in the past.

Conference Highlights:
Cybersecurity Technology Showcase 
We're offering a unique opportunity for delegates to participate in this new initiative and learn about the latest technologies, products, discoveries, and inventions with a cybersecurity theme.
