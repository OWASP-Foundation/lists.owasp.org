Spring Presentations

Guest speaker: Andrew Tillman, 8ARC Ltd

Abstract: &#8220;Introduction to Open Source Intelligence&quot;

This talk will provide an introduction to Open Source Intelligence and give an insight into what is needed to conduct an Open Source Intelligence Investigation. The subject matter is designed for persons who are interested in the information discovery phase of an investigation and/or research activity, and will provide theoretical and practical advice and guidance.  The learning points gained from the &#8216;Introduction to Open Source Intelligence&#8217; are intended to be transferable for numerous uses and are adaptable for both public and private sector organisations.

Abstract - 1 Kit, 8 Steps, 30 Days. How we Raised Application Security Awareness

 

We created an application security awareness kit for organisations to run a month long secure coding awareness enhancement program with their developers. We shipped 362 physical kits including an interactive quiz, giveaways and other incentives. During this session you will learn how to effectively educate developers on secure coding best practices, play an interactive gamified session and demonstrate your knowledge and win your very own secure development kits.

 

Learn how to engage developers with Application Security

 

View a case study about Application Security education, how it can be gamified and made interactive and appealing to any audience

 

Request your own education kit to try it out within your organization     

 

Understand why developers are a core function in the cyber security world and why it is critical that they become more security aware

 

Guest Speaker: John Haine, Chairman, IoT Security Foundation (TBC)

Background

 

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit worldwide charitable organisation focused on improving the security of application software. Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organisations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.

The Department of Computing &amp; Technology at Anglia Ruskin University is enhancing its curricula and capabilities in information security following its successful BSc(Hons) Information Security and Forensic Computing pathway. Establishing a joint professional networking group with OWASP concentrating on aspects of computing and application security is a key part of this enhancement. A key aim the department is working towards is developing a MSc Information Security specialising in Application Security and as part of this activity looking to develop and a local Information Security Student Society.
