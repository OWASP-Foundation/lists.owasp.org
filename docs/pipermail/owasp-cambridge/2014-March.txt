Subject: [Owasp-cambridge] OWASP Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
Message-ID: <0EBEA1E7-F17B-4CE3-B6BF-03EA0DD78E28@owasp.org>

Dear All
 
I?d like to promote again the OWASP Mentoring for the  Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
 
This gives students stipends ($5000) to write code for open source projects  (in this particular case security based open source projects).  Students are mentored by a project leader from OWASP or other community champion and gain exposure to real world software development and industrial experience.  Essentially this is another way of gaining experience on a student?s CV and is effectively a way of gaining a paid internship over the summer months.
 
Further details on the program can be found here
 
http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014
 
Here?s the list of idea?s for student projects where OWASP Project leaders need help
 
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSoC2014_Ideas
It would be good to really push involvement with GSoC this year especially as we will be hosting the AppSec Europe Conference in June
 
Applications open on 10th March
 
Many thanks
 
Adrian
