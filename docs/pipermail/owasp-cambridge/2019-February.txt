?     Security of frameworks

?     Payment Security, PCI impact on AppSec, tools, frameworks, best
practices

?     Blockchain & AppSecurity

?     Cryptography and its use (and abuse) in Mobile and Web Apps

Recommended talk duration is 45 minutes with additional 10-15 minutes for
any live demos and Q&A.

We also encourage short ?lightning? talks: 5-10 minutes in duration.
