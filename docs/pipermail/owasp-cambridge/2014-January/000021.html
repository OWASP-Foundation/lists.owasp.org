Joint OWASP Cambridge Chapter&amp; KPMG LLP &#8211; Security Seminar

 
Tuesday 4th February 2013 17:30 &#8211; 20:30, Lord Ashcroft Building (LAB003), Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.
 
Hosted by the Department of Computing &amp; Technology, Anglia Ruskin University, OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Cambridge Chapter &amp; KPMG LLP

Guest speakers: Yiannis Chrysanthou (KPMG)
 
Yiannis has been in the information security field for about 6 years now. Prior to joining KPMG, he was an Ethical Hacking Instructor and a Project Manager for various infrastructure projects.
 
He is an active member of Team Hashcat. Winner of Crackmeifyoucan competition at Defcon (2nd place in 2013,1st place in 2012, 2nd place in 2011 and 1st place in 2010), Winner of Positive Hackdays / Hashrunner (1st place 2012,2nd place 2013).
 
Interviewed by BBC <A HREF="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24519306">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24519306</A> and ArsTechnica <A HREF="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/how-the-bible-and-youtube-are-fueling-the-next-frontier-of-password-cracking/2/">http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/how-the-bible-and-youtube-are-fueling-the-next-frontier-of-password-cracking/2/</A>  about password cracking.
 
Title : Modern Password Cracking
 
This presentation briefly describes the most popular password cracking techniques. It then suggests an optimized attack that combines several techniques with best performance in mind. The presentation suggests the use of Markov Chains for password recovery, in combination with a range of other modified versions of common attacks.
 
All attacks work together and make use of common resources such as Dictionaries, and Rulesets to achieve the most optimal output possible. The result is a dynamic, highly flexible and robust attack that can be used by anyone with average computer literacy and limited resources within reasonable time.
 
Guest speakers: Damien King (KPMG)
 
Damien has 1st class BSc Applied Computer Science; Distinction &amp;  MSc Information Security; Dissertation in Mobile Device Exploitation. 
 
He is currently a Penetration Tester at KPMG and likes to hack &#8220;stuff&#8221;.
 
He also has an interest in automation/scripting in python - hence the exploitation tool he will present. 
 
Title: Filename Enumeration with TildeTool
 
In certain versions of Microsoft IIS, it is possible to detect the short names of files and directories which have an 8.3 file naming scheme (e.g. FILENA~1.TXT) equivalent in Windows.
 
This issue particularly affects .Net websites that are vulnerable to direct URL access, as an attacker can find important files and folders that they are not normally visible.
 
We will first talk through the steps of how to test for this vulnerability manually, then demonstrate 'TildeTool' which automates the process.
 
 
Background
 
OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of application software. Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.  
The Department of Computing &amp; Technology at Anglia Ruskin University is enhancing its curricula and capabilities in information security following its successful BSc(Hons) Information Security and Forensic Computing pathway.  Establishing a joint professional networking group with OWASP concentrating on aspects of computing and application security is a key part of this enhancement.  A key aim the department is working towards is developing a MSc Information Security specialising in Application Security and as part of this activity looking to develop and a local Information Security Student Society
