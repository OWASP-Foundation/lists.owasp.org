<PRE> *OWASP Cambridge Chapter Meeting -Tuesday 13th March 2018*

Tuesday 13th March 2018 17:30 &#8211; 20:30, Lord Ashcroft Building
(LAB002/LAB006), Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.

Hosted by the Cyber Security &amp; Networking Research Group, Anglia Ruskin
University, and OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Cambridge
Chapter

This evening is part of a series of evening events on raising awareness for
local  businesses &amp; organisations on the issues of cyber security and
cybercrime, what regulations and legislation do organisations need to be
aware to protect themselves and what is considered best practice in these
challenging times.

*Background *

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit
worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of
application software. Their mission is to make application security
visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about
true application security risks.

The *Cyber Security and Networking *(*CSN*) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin
University has close working strategic relationships with industry,
professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in
the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application
security research.  We have strong international links with professional
organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP &amp; the UK Cyber Security Forum
amongst others.  The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner
nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and
educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business
environment.  These will be achieved through the investigation of threats
posed to information systems and understanding the impact of attacks and
creation of cyber-based warning systems which gathering threat
intelligence, automate threat detection, alert users and neutralising
attacks.  For network security we are researching securing the next
generation of software defined infrastructures from the application API and
control/data plane attacks. Other key work includes Computer forensic
analysis, digital evidence crime scenes and evidence visualisation as well
as Cyber educational approaches such as developing Capture the Flag (CTF)
resources and application security programs.



*Speaker Biographies &amp; Abstracts*
David Johansson &#8211; Principal Consultant Synopsys Software Integrity Group
(formerly Cigital). Bio:

David Johansson has over 10 years of experience in software security,
working as a consultant for several different companies. A large part of
his work has been focused on secure software development in general and web
security in particular. He has trained hundreds of developers and testers
in various security courses, and presented talks at conferences such as
OWASP AppSec USA and AppSec EU. David lives in London where he works as a

*Abstract: &#8220;OWASP Top 10 2017&#8221;*

After much anticipation, and some passionate criticism along the way, the
new OWASP Top 10 2017 was finally released end of last year. This talk will
discuss some of the criticism and concern raised with the first release
candidate, the changes in project ownership and approach that followed, and
of course the actual Top 10 items that made the final list. We will
conclude the talk with discussing what the new Top 10 list means for
developers and testers, and how we can use it to improve our software
security initiatives.

Response Consultant, 3B Data Security LLP*
