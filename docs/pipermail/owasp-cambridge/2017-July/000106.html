<PRE>Dear All

A quick heads up for our next event.

We're looking to arrnage our first chapter meeting of the academic year for
2017 consisting of a Securiing Coding Presenttion and Tournament hosted by
Secure Code Wariior on Tuesday 12th September at Anglia Ruskin University
in Cambridge (5:00 -  9:00)

*Secure Coding tournament &#8211; what is it all about?*


Join this live interactive tournament which is sure to be a fun,
challenging learning experience for all.  Whether you are eager to *prove
your web application AppSec knowledge of the OWASP Top 10 and more*&#8230;.and
watch as you climb to the top of the Leaderboard or simply want to learn
more about how to code more securely &#8211; everyone is welcome and there will
be prizes / SWAG for the winner(s).

Participants are presented with any of three kinds of vulnerable code
challenges - *identify the problem, locate the insecure code, and fix the
vulnerability*. Gamification helps to make the exercise a fun, engaging and
interactive experience. Participants can select from various software
languages to complete the tournament, including:

Java EE, Java Spring, C# MVC, C# WebForms, Ruby on Rails, Python Django &amp;
Node.Js.

*Who should take part?*

Any developer with an interest in secure coding!


In past tournaments, developers from varying levels of experience, skill
levels and various job roles have competed, but all have a common interest
in security and the future of security.


The aim of this event is to connect the OWASP Cambridge Chapter in a more
open and engaging setting. Security experts will be on-hand to chat and
help people during the event.


Guaranteed to be a fun and insightful evening!

*Why should I take part?*


Becoming the first ever *OWASP Cambridge Secure Code Champion* should be
enough to whet the appetite. However, there will also be prizes, pizza and
beer on hand. It is a great opportunity to test your skill levels and have
fun on the Secure Code Warrior platform, connect with like-minded folks
interested in secure coding and get industry insight from Matias Madou&#8217;s
keynote speech &#8211; all free of charge.


More details in a few wewks (including the eventbrite booking page)


Many thanks


Adrian
