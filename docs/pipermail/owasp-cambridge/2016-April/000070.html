<PRE>OWASP Cambridge Chapter Security Seminar

Tuesday 12th April 2016 17:30 &#8211; 19:30, Lord Ashcroft Building (LAB002), Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.

Hosted by the Department of Computing &amp; Technology, Anglia Ruskin University, and OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Cambridge Chapter

Guest speakers: Fraser Kyne, Bromium

Title: Replacing the signature, Micro virtualisation as a tool for end point
protection

Abstract:

The software on modern PCs and mobile devices has become too large and complex to secure via conventional means, making it an easy target for malware.
!This session will look at the uncomfortable truths behind why the bad guys are winning, and propose what we can realistically do about it by taking advantage of hardware-assisted virtualisation.

What attendees will learn:

&#8226; Current malware trends and likely risk areas in the coming months &#8226; The problem with Defence in Depth and blacklisting/whitelisting
&#8226; A new architectural approach to solving the malware problem

Biography:

Fraser Kyne leads Systems Engineering for Bromium in EMEA, and is a member of the Office of the CTO. He previously acted as Director of Products &#8211; reporting to the CEO and co-founder Dr. Ian Pratt. Fraser&#8217;s role has encompassed a wide range of both engineering and customer-facing activity. Prior to joining Bromium Fraser was a Technical Specialist and Business Development Manager at Citrix Systems. He has been a speaker at various industry events on topics such as virtualisation, security, desktop transformation and cloud computing.

Background

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of application software. Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.

The Department of Computing &amp; Technology at Anglia Ruskin University is enhancing its curricula and capabilities in information security following its successful BSc(Hons) Information Security and Forensic Computing pathway.
Establishing a joint professional networking group with OWASP concentrating on aspects of computing and application security is a key part of this enhancement. A key aim the department is working towards is developing a MSc Information Security specialising in Application Security and as part of this activity looking to develop and a local Information Security Student Society.
