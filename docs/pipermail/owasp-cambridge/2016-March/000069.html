<PRE>Just a reminder for this weeks meet up 


OWASP Cambridge Chapter Security Seminar

Tuesday 8th March 2016 17:30 &#8211; 19:30, Lord Ashcroft Building (LAB002), Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.

Hosted by the Department of Computing &amp; Technology, Anglia Ruskin University, and OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Cambridge Chapter

Guest speakers:  Andrew Lee-Thorp, Cigital

Title: So you want to use a WebView? Android WebView: Attack and Defence

Abstract: 

The (Android) WebView is an embeddable component that powers the majority of internet-enabled apps. In Android, WebViews are currently a hot topic but for all the wrong reasons. WebViews make connections, render HTML and run JavaScript and so can be attacked using traditional web attacks like connection hijacking and XSS. Secondly, WebView-enabled apps combine local resources with web-based content that are rendered in the same container. This makes a Same Origin Policy bypass far more dangerous: it can mean access to the local device file-system and juicy local user data that you thought was sandboxed. Malicious code can even target other applications remotely by using the WebView as a proxy. Finally WebViews create residual risks that simply cannot be mitigated through any in-app technical control. This talk is aimed at both testers and developers. They learn some fundamental WebView mistakes, how to attack them, how to fix them and which vulnerabilities simply must be accepted in this design.

Biography:

Andrew Lee-Thorp is a security consultant with over 10 years of experience cutting his teeth in development from smart cards through to high-end servers systems.  He currently works as a Consultant with Cigital Ltd where he performs code reviews, architectural risk analysis, and Android testing.

Background

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of application software. Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.

The Department of Computing &amp; Technology at Anglia Ruskin University is enhancing its curricula and capabilities in information security following its successful BSc(Hons) Information Security and Forensic Computing pathway. Establishing a joint professional networking group with OWASP concentrating on aspects of computing and application security is a key part of this enhancement. A key aim the department is working towards is developing a MSc Information Security specialising in Application Security and as part of this activity looking to develop and a local Information Security Student Society.
