Fellow OWASPer's,

It's that time! The Call For Volunteers (CFV) for AppSec EU is now live!
For just 8 hours of your time and effort, we'll provide you with a full
conference pass (?500.00). We need folks to work registration desk as well
as room proctors, speaker liaisons, ticket takers for the conference
dinner, and more! Shifts start on Monday for the Trainings and run through
Thursday, so there's plenty of opportunity for you to get in your required
time and still see the talks you want to attend.

Sign up today!

We hope to see you in Cambridge at AppSec EU 2014. Cheers!

All,

Just following this up - if you?re interested in getting into the AppSec Europe conference in Cambridge next week for free, volunteer!  Better still - volunteer for Monday/Tuesday (training days) and attend the conference days you?ll have free.

The deal is - you need to volunteer for 8 hours of helping out, and you get free entry. Details below!

Cheers

Justin Clarke
Conference Committee
