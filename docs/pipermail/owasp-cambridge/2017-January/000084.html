Joint OWASP &amp; BCS Cybercrime Forensics SIG &#8220;Incident Response Day&#8221; 2017
Thursday 19th January 2017 9:30&#8211; 17:00, Lord Ashcroft Building (LAB026), Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.
Hosted by the Department of Computing &amp; Technology, Anglia Ruskin University, British Computer Society (BCS) Cybercrime Forensics Special Internet Group and OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Cambridge Chapter
It looks increasingly likely that 2016 is going to be &#8220;Year of the Data Breach&#8221; with more and more organisation&#8217;s than ever before becoming part of the self-fulfilling prophecy, &#8220;there are two types of organization, those who know they&#8217;ve been breached and those who don&#8217;t&#8221;&#8230;.
So what happens if despite your best efforts your defenses are ineffective and you suffer a data breach.  Your organization needs to know how to handle the breach either internally and externally, who to inform and who to call.
What is needed is &#8220;incident response&#8221;, an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or attack (also known as an incident). The goal is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs.
Background
OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of application software. Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.
The British Computer Society (BCS) Cybercrime Forensics Special Interest Group (SIG) promotes Cybercrime Forensics and the use of Cybercrime Forensics; of relevance to computing professionals, lawyers, law enforcement officers, academics and those interested in the use of Cybercrime Forensics and the need to address cybercrime for the benefit of those groups and of the wider public.
The Department of Computing &amp; Technology at Anglia Ruskin University is enhancing its curricula and capabilities in information security following its successful BSc(Hons) Information Security and Forensic Computing pathway. Establishing a joint professional networking group with OWASP concentrating on aspects of computing and application security is a key part of this enhancement.
Speaker Biographies

Presentation Abstracts
&#8220;Malware Red Alert: the first 24 hours&#8221;  - Steve Shepherd MBE, 7Safe/PA Consulting
It&#8217;s Friday at 19:30. You are the acting manager of your organisation&#8217;s Security Operations Centre. You are working the graveyard shift with a colleague when &#8230;
Your SIEM alerts you to what may be the presence of a Trojan in your system. But before you have a chance to respond, you receive an email from a hacker making demands.
The threat is that highly-confidential information has been stolen from your financial database. If the hacker does not receive &#163;2 million by midnight on Sunday, they will put this data on the web just before your firm&#8217;s annual financial report, due for release on Monday, is published. Their motive: to cause panic among investors by undermining the credibility of your growth and profit forecasts with data that the hacker claims they have found in emails and report documents.
What do you do next to thwart the attack, contain the incident and prevent, or at least minimise, damage to your brand name and reputation in the markets?

Security incidents, both potential and actual, occur on a frequent basis. It is therefore important to accurately categorize incidents and prioritise the most severe. Evaluation is based on the impact that the data breach may have on business operations, the potential reputational risk and the time and cost of resources engaged in recovery.
Of critical importance is the effective gathering of key information about the attack in real time. Focusing on quick fixes should be avoided. It is important to clearly document all information collected/actions performed for subsequent analysis in a post incident review/lessons learned session. A clear plan must be established, including timeframes and ownership, to implement any required changes that will mitigate future risk.
Steve Shepherd MBE describes for the business audience a series of real life scenarios that will serve as a warning to Board members and SOC managers alike, as he shares his thoughts on how to apply the CREST Three-Phase CSIR model and invites the audience to role play with him in responding to this incident.
If you think that you understand incident response procedures from a &#8216;people, process and technology&#8217; standpoint, be prepared to challenge what you deem to be fact during Steve&#8217;s practical talk and demonstration. The emphasis will be on knowledge transfer - and why software tools are never the whole answer.
&#8220;Cyber resilience and Incident Response&#8221; Tony Drewitt, Head of Consultancy, IT Governance
Tony will introduce today&#8217;s cyber threat environment and what it means in terms of security incidents.  Cyber assurance techniques will be examined from 4 different perspectives, the conventional theme&#8217;s:-

&#8226;      People,

&#8226;      Processes and

&#8226;      Technology
but also examining Digital versus Physical security dimensions.
The talk will conclude with a discussion on cyber resilience versus incident response and if incident response is a necessity, what structure should it take.
