Subject: [Owasp-cambridge] Planning for our next Chapter Meetings
Message-ID: <83C851E3-2939-4B87-A07D-03057A65EBCF@owasp.org>

Dear All

Steven and myself are starting to plan for our next set of chapter meetings (which follow) the academic year and was wondering if there is anything specific you'd like to see covered?

A few ideas/thoughts

Secure Programming Techniques. 
Application Pen Testing Tools (Beef maybe)
Other OWASP Projects 
Research projects and latest vulnerabilities 
Malware investigation 

Would anyone be interested in a UK OWASP Security Research Day, which would concentrate on leading UK academic and industry security researchers presenting their latest security research (not just AppSec).  Combined with this we're thinking about running both a cyber security startup initiative earlier to provide a seed funding opportunity for selected research projects.

Look forward to hearing from you

Adrian 

Any thoughts or views welcome

Thanks
