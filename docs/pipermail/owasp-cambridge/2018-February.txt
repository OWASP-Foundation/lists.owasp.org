Subject: [Owasp-cambridge] OWASP AppSec Europe 3rd - 6th July 2018
Message-ID: <CA+VM_Tp02mF8-1-RTdBCmOdCq7tkq8CYvR2xTvTi0YYLX1Zq2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

As you might have already heard, AppSec EU has been switched to London for
this year.

Obviously this is a recent change, so details are still to be ironed out,
but the venue (The Queen Elizabeth Center) and the dates (3rd - 6th July)
have been confirmed. The website - https://2018.appsec.eu - is up with some
information already.

Not sure when tickets will become available, but the CFP and CFT are up on
the website until 28th Feb - and London will be looking for volunteers to
help!

If anyone is interested in helping/sponsoring/training/speaking and wants
to know more drop me a note and I can put you in touch with the organisers.
Alternatively you can get them on their OWASP slack channel (sign up via
https://owasp.herokuapp.com/).

Thanks,

Adrian
