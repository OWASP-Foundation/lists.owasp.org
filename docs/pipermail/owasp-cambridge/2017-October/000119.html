<PRE> &#8220;An Evening with GDPR&#8221; Tuesday 7th November 2017

Tuesday 7th November 2017 18:15 &#8211; 20:45, Lord Ashcroft Building
(LAB003/LAB006), Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.

Hosted by the Cyber Security &amp; Networking Research Group, Anglia Ruskin
University, British Computer Society (BCS) East Anglia Region, UK Cyber
Security Forum Cambridge Cluster and OWASP (Open Web Application Security
Project) Cambridge Chapter

This evening is part of a series of 1 Day Workshops and evening events on
raising awareness for local  businesses &amp; organisations on the issues of
cyber security and cybercrime, what regulations and legislation do
organisations need to be aware to protect themselves and what is considered
best practice in these challenging times.

In 6 months Europe's data protection rules will undergo their biggest
changes in almost 2 decades. Since they were conceived in the 90s, the
amount of digital information we create, capture, and store has
exponentially increased.  In simple terms, the old regime was no longer fit
for purpose.

The solution is the mutually agreed European General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR), which will come into force on May 25 2018. It will
change how businesses and public sector organisations can handle the
information of customers.

The regulation has spawned a raft of &#8220;GDPR expertise&#8221; and scaremongers who
predict the &#8220;end of the world as know it&#8221; .  In our evening, we have two
expert opinions of what GDPR should mean to you and your business both from
an IT Security and a Legal Point of View.

*Background *

The British Computer Society (BCS) East Anglia Region represents the
computing profession in the Eastern region providing networking
opportunities for professionals and companies, a forum for continuing
professional development and encouraging young people to enter and stay in
technology based business.

The Cambridge Cyber Security Cluster is an affiliate UK Cyber Security
Forum, a government and industry led partnership which will look at how the
region can develop the skills and infrastructure to combat cyber security
threats.

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit
worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of
application software. Their mission is to make application security
visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about
true application security risks.

The *Cyber Security and Networking *(*CSN*) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin
University has close working strategic relationships with industry,
professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in
the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application
security research.  We have strong international links with professional
organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP &amp; the UK Cyber Security Forum
amongst others.  The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner
nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and
educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business
environment.  These will be achieved through the investigation of threats
posed to information systems and understanding the impact of attacks and
creation of cyber-based warning systems which gathering threat
intelligence, automate threat detection, alert users and neutralising
attacks.  For network security we are researching securing the next
generation of software defined infrastructures from the application API and
control/data plane attacks. Other key work includes Computer forensic
analysis, digital evidence crime scenes and evidence visualisation as well
as Cyber educational approaches such as developing Capture the Flag (CTF)
resources and application security programs.

*Abstract: GDPR Security &#8211; &#8220;how to do it&quot;*

The new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the biggest
shake-up in privacy legislation and data management approach for many
years. It will impact any organisation throughout the world that processes
personal data relating to EU citizens. Organisations which breach the
regulation can be fined up to 4% of their annual global turnover or 20
million Euros, whichever is greater.  Breaches will apply to firms which do
not have adequate customer consent for processing their personal data or
violate the principle of the privacy by design concepts and model. It is
crucial to note that both data controllers and processors are subject to
the rules, such as failing to carry out a privacy impact assessment or not
notifying the authority (ICO, the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office, in the
UK) about a breach. This talk will look at GDPR from the IT security
perspective.&quot;

*Abstract: GDPR Data Protection &#8211; A Lawyers View*

Data Protection has recently undergone a fundamental reappraisal with the
enactment of the new European Union General Data Protection Regulation
(&#8220;GDPR&#8221;). GDPR is not due to come fully into force until 25 May 2018; yet
businesses which do not plan for it now will be severely disadvantaged. And
whatever the final timetable for Brexit, or the nature of the agreement
under which the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, businesses will
need to comply with GDPR.

The new legislation is radically different from what is currently in place.
Instead of a notional transparency through registration and consent under
the existing legislation; real transparency under the GDPR is achieved
through a series of rights given to individuals. Examples of such
individual rights are: the right to object to data collection and the right
to be forgotten. This is backed up by much more extensive obligations on
data controllers to provide information on request and sometimes even
before a request is made.

Many lawyers focus on greater penalties under the GDPR: a maximum fine of
&#8364;20,000,000 can be imposed for breaches (up from &#163;500,000). In addition to
clarifying such penalties Dai will spend as much time on the *substantial
commercial benefits* that can be derived from the new legislation.

The talk includes mention of the following topics:

&#183;      The obligation to consider privacy when designing an electronic
system

&#183;      The obligation to consider privacy by default

&#183;      The obligation to notify breaches to the information commissioner

&#183;      The obligation to notify breaches to an individual affected

&#183;      Right to object to data collection

&#183;      Right to object to data profiling

&#183;      Right to be forgotten

&#183;      Right to data portability

&#183;      The effect of Brexit on UK data protection law
