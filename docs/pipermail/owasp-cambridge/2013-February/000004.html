<PRE>Application Security Seminar &#8211;  OWASP Cambridge Chapter

Wednesday 5th March  2013 17:30 &#8211; 20:00, Lord Ashcroft Building (LAB002), Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.

Hosted by the Department of Computing &amp; Technology, Anglia Ruskin University, OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Cambridge Chapter and IEEE Industrial Electronics Chapter

Guest speakers: 

Sarantis Makoudis is a professional Penetration Tester working for 7Safe, part of the PA Consulting Group. He received his BSc Degree on Digital Systems during 2010 and decided to continue his academic career on the subject of IT Security. He was awarded with an MSc degree on Information Security from Royal Holloway, University of London after completing his thesis on &#8220;Two-Factor authentication protocols for Secure Transactions using Mobile Phones and NFC Tags&#8221;. Sarantis joined 7Safe shortly afterwards as a Penetration Tester and security researcher, specialised in Web application security testing.

Android (in)Security: The goal of this presentation is to show typical exploitation scenarios of Android applications and how they can be used or manipulated to steal credentials and information from a user. The scenarios include installation of malicious programs, e.g. malicious keyboards, manipulations on the application to bypass security authentications, code injections inside an apk and phishing attacks targeting specific applications.

Nikhil Sreekumar is a penetration tester working for UK based organisation - 7Safe, part of PA Consulting Group. He spends a majority of his free time either rock climbing, dreaming about cars or researching new vulnerabilities and attack techniques. And, when we gets time he spends time assessing web applications and network infrastructure for security vulnerabilities and business logic flaws.

Power On, Powershell: The heart starts pounding, the brain goes into overdrive with adrenaline and a smile starts appearing. You just got access into a Windows box using a user account. Then you realise there is an AV running on the system, and the user account using which you got in is
actually a restricted account.

Time to fold up the sleeves and escalate your privs. Its time to Power on,  Powershell. The talk will try and cover various ways to escalate your privileges, and do many other cool stuff withh nothing but a powershell.

Background 

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of application software. Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.   

The Department of Computing &amp; Technology at Anglia Ruskin University is enhancing its curricula and capabilities in information security following its successful BSc(Hons) Information Security and Forensic Computing pathway.  Establishing a joint professional networking group with OWASP concentrating on aspects of computing and application security is a key part of this enhancement.  A key aim the department is working towards is developing a MSc Information Security specialising in Application Security and as part of this activity looking to develop and a local Information Security Student Society.
