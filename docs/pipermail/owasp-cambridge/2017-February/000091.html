<PRE> Fpr those interested in the Cyber Security innovation side of things or
are part of a SME Cyber related business, the Cambrdge Cyber Policy Securty
cluster is running its next meeting next week.  We have a Senior Cyber
Security Policy Advisor from the UK Government Dept of Culture, Media &amp;
Sport.

IF interested, please follow the regsitration link below

The Cambridge Cyber Security Cluster has been formed, under the umbrella of
the UK Cyber Security Forum, by a number of cyber security focused
organisations in and around the Cambridge (Silicon Fen) &amp; Peterborough area&#8217;s
(but also including East Anglia as a whole) including Anglia Ruskin
University &lt;<A HREF="http://www.anglia.ac.uk/">http://www.anglia.ac.uk/</A>&gt; &amp; its Cyber Security Research Team
&lt;<A HREF="https://cyberexchange.uk.net/#/company/anglia-ruskin-university">https://cyberexchange.uk.net/#/company/anglia-ruskin-university</A>&gt;



The aims of the Cluster are two-fold:-



   - To support the members of the cluster by communicating National and
   International initiatives and trade opportunities, providing a networking
   platform to share ideas and best practice, encouraging collaboration and
   identifying partnership opportunities so that small cyber security
   specialist businesses in the East of England can find new ways to grow.



   - To support the newly proposed devolved Greater Cambridgeshire area and
   the East of England&#8217;s commitment to Cyber Security (and UK Government's
   Cyber Security Strategy) by building cyber security knowledge, skills and
   capabilities in the Region, to make businesses more resilient to cyber
   attacks and the East of England Region, one of the most secure places in
   the world to do business.



These meetings are free to attend for any company actively working in Cyber
Security.



If you, as an individual or an organisation, are interested in exploring
what you can offer to support the UK Cyber Security Strategy in East Anglia
then please contact us &lt;<A HREF="http://cams@ukcybersecurityforum.com">http://cams@ukcybersecurityforum.com</A>&gt;.
