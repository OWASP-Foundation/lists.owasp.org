We would like to invite potential speakers to present talks at our upcoming
OWASP Cambridge Chapter (@OwaspCambs) events. We typically hold events 8-10
times a year, often a Tuesday evening once a month and sometimes a themed
day event January, May/June and September.

The events we have schedule for the next few months are:

   - Tuesday 26th February 5 &#8211; 9pm (unlikley)
   - Mid March - Tuesday 12th March 5pm - 9pm
   - Early April - Tuesday 9th April 5pm - 9pm
   - Mid May - Tuesday 14th May 5pm - 9pm

Most of our events are hosted at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge with
the School of Computing &amp; Information Science&#8217;s Cyber Security &amp; Networking
Research Group (@ARUCyberRes)

We often hold joint events with BCS East Anglia Region, BCS Cybercrime
Forensics (@BCSForensics), BCS DevSecOps, IISP East Region, ISC2 East,
ISACA and others. We would love to put joint events on with other groups as
well.

   - Builders
   - Breakers
   - Defenders

As a guideline we invite talks on the following topics (not an exhaustive
list):
