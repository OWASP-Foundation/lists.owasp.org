<PRE>OWASP AppSec Europe 2017 Belfast - 8th-12th of May
Join us for the annual conference in Europe

Call for Papers

The OWASP AppSec conference in Europe is an established and premier venue for web applications leaders, software engineers, researchers and visionaries from all over the world. OWASP AppSec Europe gathers the application security community in a 5-days event to share and discuss novel ideas, initiatives and advancements. The 2017 conference will take place in Belfast from May 8th to 12th 2017, with papers/talks presented on 11th and 12th May.

Topics
For our event, we are looking for &#8220;the next&#8221;, cutting edge research in the context of web applications, secure development, security management and privacy. Our goal is to give both academic researchers and industry practitioners the possibility to share their latest findings with the rest of the community, including coverage via our media channels. It won&#8217;t be a knockout criteria if your talk has been presented before but we would appreciate if you would let us know.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:

Novel web vulnerabilities and countermeasures
New technologies, paradigms, tools
OWASP tools or projects in practice
Secure development: frameworks, best practices, secure coding, methods, processes, SDLC
Browser security
Mobile security and security for the mobile web
Cloud security
REST/SOAP security
Security of frameworks
Large-scale security assessments of web applications and services
Privacy risks in the web and the cloud
Management topics in Application Security: Business Risks, Awareness Programs, Project Management, Managing SDLC
To ensure the best talks available are presented at AppSec Europe we are incorporating blind reading as part of our process. This means that names and job titles will be removed when the paper abstract is being reviewed. All speakers will be given access to speaker mentorship, we especially encourage first time speakers to take advantage of this service.

Submission
To submit a proposal use <A HREF="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=appseceu2017">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=appseceu2017</A>

The program committee will review your submission based on a descriptive abstract of your intended presentation. Feel free to attach a preliminary version of your presentation if available, or any other supporting materials. Keep in mind: the better your description is, the better our review will be. Please review your proposal thoroughly as accepted abstract and bio submitted will be published 1:1 on our site. If your presentation is accepted for inclusion in the conference program, you are free to submit a white paper describing your work, which will be added to the website.

Important dates
Submission deadline: January 9th, 2017
Notification of acceptance: February 6th, 2017
Conference days: May 11th &#8211; 12th 2017
Program committee

OWASP values vendor neutrality. You need to use the OWASP presentation template and you&#8217;re not allowed to place marketing pitches in your slides. All presentation slides will be published on the conference website after the conference. Please make sure that any pictures and other materials in your slides don&#8217;t violate any copyrights. You are solely liable for copyright violations. You may choose any CC license for your slides, including CC0. OWASP does suggest open licenses.
