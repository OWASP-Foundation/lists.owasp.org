Joint OWASP &amp; BCS Cybercrime Forensics SIG &#8220;Incident Response Day&#8221; 2017

Thursday 19th January 2017 9:30&#8211; 17:00, Lord Ashcroft Building (LAB026),
Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.

Hosted by the Department of Computing &amp; Technology, Anglia Ruskin
University, British Computer Society (BCS) Cybercrime Forensics Special
Internet Group and OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Cambridge
Chapter

It looks increasingly likely that 2016 is going to be &#8220;Year of the Data
Breach&#8221; with more and more organisation&#8217;s than ever before becoming part of
the self-fulfilling prophecy, &#8220;there are two types of organization, those
who know they&#8217;ve been breached and those who don&#8217;t&#8221;&#8230;.

So what happens if despite your best efforts your defenses are ineffective
and you suffer a data breach.  Your organization needs to know how to
handle the breach either internally and externally, who to inform and who
to call.

What is needed is &#8220;*incident response*&#8221;, an organized approach to
addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or attack (also
known as an *incident*). The goal is to handle the situation in a way that
limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs.

*Background *

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit
worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of
application software. Their mission is to make application security
visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about
true application security risks.

The British Computer Society (BCS) Cybercrime Forensics Special Interest
Group (SIG) promotes Cybercrime Forensics and the use of Cybercrime
Forensics; of relevance to computing professionals, lawyers, law
enforcement officers, academics and those interested in the use of
Cybercrime Forensics and the need to address cybercrime for the benefit of
those groups and of the wider public.

The Department of Computing &amp; Technology at Anglia Ruskin University is
enhancing its curricula and capabilities in information security following
its successful BSc(Hons) Information Security and Forensic Computing
pathway. Establishing a joint professional networking group with OWASP
concentrating on aspects of computing and application security is a key
part of this enhancement.

Security Centre (NCSC).*

Before joining the NCSC, Peter was Deputy Director Operations for CERT-UK.
Prior to CERT-UK, Peter was the Information Security Advisor for Brecon

*Presentation Abstracts*

*&#8220;Malware Red Alert: the first 24 hours&#8221;  - Steve Shepherd MBE, 7Safe/PA
Consulting *

It&#8217;s Friday at 19:30. You are the acting manager of your organisation&#8217;s
Security Operations Centre. You are working the graveyard shift with a
colleague when &#8230;

Your SIEM alerts you to what may be the presence of a Trojan in your
system. But before you have a chance to respond, you receive an email from
a hacker making demands.

The threat is that highly-confidential information has been stolen from
your financial database. If the hacker does not receive &#163;2 million by
midnight on Sunday, they will put this data on the web just before your
firm&#8217;s annual financial report, due for release on Monday, is published.
Their motive: to cause panic among investors by undermining the credibility
of your growth and profit forecasts with data that the hacker claims they
have found in emails and report documents.

What do you do next to thwart the attack, contain the incident and prevent,
or at least minimise, damage to your brand name and reputation in the
markets?



Security incidents, both potential and actual, occur on a frequent basis.
It is therefore important to accurately categorize incidents and prioritise
the most severe. Evaluation is based on the impact that the data breach may
have on business operations, the potential reputational risk and the time
and cost of resources engaged in recovery.

Of critical importance is the effective gathering of key information about
the attack in real time. Focusing on quick fixes should be avoided. It is
important to clearly document all information collected/actions performed
for subsequent analysis in a post incident review/lessons learned session.
A clear plan must be established, including timeframes and ownership, to
implement any required changes that will mitigate future risk.

Steve Shepherd MBE describes for the business audience a series of real
life scenarios that will serve as a warning to Board members and SOC
managers alike, as he shares his thoughts on how to apply the CREST
Three-Phase CSIR model and invites the audience to role play with him in
responding to this incident.

If you think that you understand incident response procedures from a
&#8216;people, process and technology&#8217; standpoint, be prepared to challenge what
you deem to be fact during Steve&#8217;s practical talk and demonstration. The
emphasis will be on knowledge transfer - and why software tools are never
the whole answer.

*&#8220;Cyber resilience and Incident Response&#8221; **Tony Drewitt, Head of
Consultancy, IT Governance*

Tony will introduce today&#8217;s cyber threat environment and what it means in
terms of security incidents.  Cyber assurance techniques will be examined
from 4 different perspectives, the conventional theme&#8217;s:-

&#183;      People,

&#183;      Processes and

&#183;      Technology

but also examining Digital versus Physical security dimensions.

The talk will conclude with a discussion on cyber resilience versus
incident response and if incident response is a necessity, what structure
should it take.
