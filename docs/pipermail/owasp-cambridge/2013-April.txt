Dear All

We are proposing our next OWASP Cambridge Roadshow on the 16th April, initial speaker biography and details below.  Additional speakers, room details and times to follow.

Another heads up for a proposed event on the 13/14 May when the OWASP EU Roadshow is hopefully coming to town for two days of speakers and training activities.  Please put the dates in your diary.

More details to follow.

Many thanks

Adrian

Topic: "Everything we know is Wrong" Cambridge OWASP Chapter Meeting 16th April

Eoin has recently devliered this at RSA (Feb 2013) in San Fransisco and Semafor (March 2013) in Poland to great effect.

The premise behind this talk is to challenge both the technical controls we recommend to developers and also out actual approach to testing. This talk is sure to challenge the status quo of web security today.

"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results." - Albert Einstein

We continue to rely on a ?pentest? to secure our applications.

Why do we think it is acceptable to perform a time-limited test of an application to help ensure security when a determined attacker may spend 10-100 times longer attempting to find a suitable vulnerability?

Our testing methodologies are non-consistent and rely on the individual and the tools they use.
Some carpenters use glue and some use nails when building a wooden house. Which is best and why do we accept poor inconsistent quality.

Fire and forget scanners won?t solve security issues. Attackers take time and skill but our industry accepts the output of a software programme to help ensure security?
How can we expect developers to listen to security consultants when the consultant has never written a line of code? Why don?t we ask ?How much code development have you done, seen as you are assessing my code for security bugs?"

Currently we treat vulnerabilities like XSS and SQLI as different issues but the root causes it the same. ? it?s all code injection theory!! Why do we do this and make security bugs over complex?

Why are we still happy with ?Testing security out? rather than the more superior ?building security in??

Dear All

The proposed Cambridge Chapter meeting on the16th April has had to be cancelled as the speakers have been called overseas on work placements at short notice.  Consequently we've had to a cancel the chapter meeting.

Our next event is he s OWASP EU Roadshow will on the 13th/14th May which is still going ahead

Anyone wishing to do a speakers slot or recommend a speaker (we can pay travel expenses), plea let us know.  I've 2-3 speakers lined up and ideally would like 6-7 for the day.

Many thanks

Adrian
