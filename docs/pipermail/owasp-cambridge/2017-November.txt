OWASP Cambridge Chapter Meeting -Tuesday 5th December 2017 

Tuesday 5th December 2017 17:15 ? 20:30, Lord Ashcroft Building (LAB003/LAB006), Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.

Hosted by the Cyber Security & Networking Research Group, Anglia Ruskin University, and OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Cambridge Chapter

This evening is part of a series of evening events on raising awareness for local  businesses & organisations on the issues of cyber security and cybercrime, what regulations and legislation do organisations need to be aware to protect themselves and what is considered best practice in these challenging times.

Background

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of application software. Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.

The Cyber Security and Networking (CSN) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research.  We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP & the UK Cyber Security Forum amongst others.  The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment.  These will be achieved through the investigation of threats posed to information systems and understanding the impact of attacks and creation of cyber-based warning systems which gathering threat intelligence, automate threat detection, alert users and neutralising attacks.  For network security we are researching securing the next generation of software defined infrastructures from the application API and control/data plane attacks. Other key work includes Computer forensic analysis, digital evidence crime scenes and evidence visualisation as well as Cyber educational approaches such as developing Capture the Flag (CTF) resources and application security programs.
