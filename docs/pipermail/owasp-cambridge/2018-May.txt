Dear All

I've had a couple of requests for where volunteers can register to help for
the upcoming conference.

Individuals who complete 8 hours of volunteering for the conference will
receive a free ticket to attend conference sessions on Thursday and Friday.

Travel and lodging are still the responsibility of the individual;
unfortunately the conference cannot cover these costs

To sign up

Thanks

Adrian
