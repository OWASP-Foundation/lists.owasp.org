To anybody who has been working recently on the official YouTube OWASP
channel.

Please refrain for making any changes, including uploads, to the
official OWASP Channel without first consulting the project group by
using this mailing list.

I noticed two main changes that will actually make harder our process of
getting the channel recognized by Google:
- The change of the OWASP Channel name
- Uploading of matching third party content

Google/YouTube is unforgiving about copyright strikes and the channel
name change is usually a one time thing.

I remind you that I'll be working more on the project this October and
advance it more and I hope that our connections with Google will
compensate for this "strike".

Thanks for your patience and comprehension,

- Jonathan

Sure,

we uploaded a video from a screen capture of a TV announcement about OWASP.

This make us do a copyright strike automatically since the content was
automatically recognized by the system:

"""
Your video may include clips that are owned by a third party.

To watch the matched clips please play the video on the right. The video
will play from the point where the matched content was identified.

Your video is available and playable.

Here are the details:

"Joy News @ 8 6 9 13)", audiovisual content administered by: 0:01
Multimedia Group
"""

This is one strike. Three strikes and our account is banned. And
actually I think we automatically lost some features of our partnership.

More infos:

In order to get youtube.com/owasp I wanted to show professionalism from
us, but now this has been jeopardized quite much... so I'm kind of
disappointed on myself that I didn't think that people would upload
other things than what we discussed (Google Hangouts). But we are in a
learning process and I learned that in my documentation and presentation
at OWASP projects summit I'll have to talk about copyright issues.

I'm not a lawyer so I can't tell.

One thing I know, is that everything that was previously aired somewhere
from people with copyright infringement system are automatically counted
as infringement on YouTube. The scan is made just after you upload.

Even if we are legally right, YouTube won't care and will make a strike
anyways. And it's almost impossible or too much expensive (in time) to
contest.

We cannot even have a content we own with a song that is playing in the
background that is copyrighted.

If you want to make it up, we will need to see what contact we have with
YouTube in order to get /owasp. I fear that our "strike" will be in the
system for 6 months if we don't use any Google contacts.

If we don't have anyone, the plan will be to wait 6 months and get 30k+
views in the last 3 months of that waiting time (or maybe after) in
order to get some recognition from YouTube.

In the mean time, you can complete (as OWASP?) this
https://www.youtube.com/copyright_school

I don't think disputing the strike will help, mostly because doing so
will be like a big process and we will lose precious time doing it.

AppSec USA <http://appsecusa.org/2013/activities/owasp-project-summit/> is
just a month away and there is so much more going on than just the
conference. From November 18-21 the Project
Summit<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects_Summit_2013/Home>will
be held in tandem with AppSec USA. For those unfamiliar with the
Project Summit, it is a smaller version of the much larger OWASP Summits.
The Project Summit gives project leaders a chance to showcase their project
process, as well as allow attendees to contribute to the project.

Featured at this year?s Project Summit are nine sessions, two of which will
be held over the course of the four days. You can sign up for each session
below:
