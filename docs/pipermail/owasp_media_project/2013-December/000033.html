<PRE>TLDR; 11k views and 450 subscribers!


Hi Media Project list,

as you all know, we did a lot of work at last AppSecUSA in order to get
43 videos online for 32 hours for the talks, and also 6 videos from the
Project Summit for 2.5 hours of content. All of that was online live for
the summit and 24h after for the first talks, then the rest was
published in one week the week just after the conference.

I managed to get the Project Summit recording by myself, but for the
talks, it wouldn't have been possible without the support from AppSecUSA
who used their resources to help us with that. To make it clear, we had
a professional firm that recorded and uploaded the videos into YouTube.
The only work I did on my side was to organize them into a playlist and
publish them periodically.

On the fail part, we missed some of the important talks, such as the
keynote because it was at the very beginning and also Jeremia's talk
that was a hit, but we achieved 77% publishing within one week. One
thing that actually wasn't real good in the short run was that the title
didn't contains &quot;OWASP&quot; nor &quot;AppSecUSA&quot;. That will probably hurt us in
the long run and I might decide to change titles if we don't come out
first in search results (as for now we don't
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=appsecusa">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=appsecusa</A>).

We actually plan to do the same thing for AppSecUSA 2014 and I'll be in
touch with the team in order to prepare in advance. They want to have
live streaming and be as fast.

One thing that is sure, is that we need more people in OWASP Media
project. The good news is, unlike most other OWASP projects, you don't
need to be an application security specialist to be really useful, you
just need to be motivated to share knowledge with the world. I think that

Now for some stats, covering from Nov 17 2013 to Dec 19 2013.

We are at 11,289 views and 79,874 of estimated watched minutes.

Let me remind you that before that, we where at 245 views for 1,312
minutes, mainly from the OWASP Global Meetings live hangouts.

We are at 438 subscribers and we gained 442 of them with AppSecUSA
efforts. We lost 4 hence the numbers.

The average view duration is 7:04 minutes, so 16% of the total times of
videos. Since we have mostly one hour long videos, this is normal and in
fact is probably a great number.

Notables popular videos are

&gt;<i>From what I saw, Simon's used his network to publish his videos and I
</I>helped him by putting it as the trailer for the channel for a while.
Same with Jim but with less engagement from his network (less comments).
Timothy's was published from an external news website and got some views
trough that.

Finally, the following countries were the top viewership :
United States 37%
Canada 12%
India 4.5%
United Kingdom 4.0%

I must point out that we were watched in 114 countries. That's amazing
and shows the power of OWASP worldwide.

With that big first step done, we will continue with our roadmap
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Roadmap">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Roadmap</A>
and the next thing on the table is to present a Webinar on how to use
Google Hangout and try to setup the next webinars within our YouTube
channel. I also want to shake things with the Chapters by incite them to
use Hangout and YouTube in order to get more into the Global Chapter
Meetings Project. This has great potential but is not really used right
now for helping smaller chapters to get contents.

And and last, but not least, we are officially on the www.owasp.org home
page and we can control what is shown trough that small playlist:

Thanks to all who contributed and helped with OWASP Media Project,

See you next year!
