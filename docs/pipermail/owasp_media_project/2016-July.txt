@Maik Thank you very much for your detailed report! Sorry you had troubles
and congratulation on overcoming them.

For the video description part, are you planning to enter the full
description from sched or it's done as it is now?

I'll forward your comments to AppSecEU point of contact that I have (
Tiffany.long).

@all
Actually, buying equipment is an option!

Because we're a non for profit and the goal of the volunteering is to be
well, low cost, we'll need to figure out a really cost-effective way of
doing it while accounting the quality of the recordings. I'm looking for a
solution that mixes slides capture + speaker in order to achieve best of
both world. I've seen some conference recording like that; we just need to
figure out how to package it (with training being part of the package) so
it can be shipped world-wide when needed.

That all said, I must do the OWASP thing and reminds you that we are trying
to consolidate the efforts into the OWASP Media Project
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project - budget and equipment
can come from this project. I'm CC:ing this email to the list and I will
welcome anyone who wants to help, especially in Europe! So Tom, if you wish
to join in you are more than welcome!

Thanks all for your implications, we're at 362k views and it is really
because of all of you guys!

- Jonathan

Hi Sunil,

The demo was in another screen and what you see is the main screen. We
don't have any other videos related to it sorry.

Aside from doing a Google search on the demo, I don't know how to find more
information. Maybe try finding and asking the speakers directly. I know
jason is on twitter @Jhaddix

That's all we got, sorry!
