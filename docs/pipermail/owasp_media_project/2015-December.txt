Hi Martin,

yes we have capture cards (4-5) and even some laptops (3) since last
AppSecUSA.

We will have to ship like any other conference equipment. Right now the
equipment is scattered around San Francisco, Denver, Montreal, and OWASP
Global Storage but we could easily ship them.

By the way, using the cards is rather different than your usual setup. More
preparation is required and you'll need one laptop with USB 3.0 per card
(we can provide 3 for now). We have documentation here
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#Hardware_and_other_software
and we plan to write a more complete guide as soon as we are finish with
AppSecUSA 2015 uploads (yes we still have some editing to do).

Thanks,

- Jonathan
