Hi list,

I just added Neil Matatall as a new manager in order to let him uploads
AppSec California 2014 recordings.

Neil, just do a playlist and upload the vids unlisted and you are good
to go. I would suggest to release them in batch through the week. I can
help you with @owasp on twitter in order to promote them.

If you wish to stay with us afterwards and do other stuff you are
welcome to.

Just a simple rule not to upload or make any other front facing action
that is not asked first through this list. Also, we have to take very
seriously Copyright issues so no content uploaded should be copyrighted
including background music.

For more information see
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Help

Thanks for all the content!

OK, I've uploaded all of the videos, unlisted, and added them to the
AppSec California Playlist.

I have received the following approvals to post the videos:

That seems like a good first batch. But I'll wait until tomorrow to
start making them public.

I did a little trick with tags and added "Latest AppSec California 2014
talks" section into the front page of the channel
https://www.youtube.com/user/OWASPGLOBAL

Neil, I'm not sure about adding the videos directly to the playlist
while unlisted, go check
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG9lbJhvAOJrUaGXpZns7O0g
in a private browing window and you'll see a lot of gray [Private Video].

If you share the video one by one it's OK, but if you want to share the
whole playlist it could be rather annoying for viewers.

Thanks,

- Jonathan

I'm certainly not going to share them 1 by 1 :) I took the path of
least resistance, uploading at once and releasing once approved.

The recording of me talking about OWASP Media Project during the Webinar
is now online :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xDgPmPPn_I

I had some discussion with Kate beforehand, and we figured out that the
best way to consolidate the Webinars and OWASP Media Project is to
upload them to our YouTube channel.

Kate will send me a dropbox link with the videos and I'll check if they
are easily uploadable on YouTube. If so, I think Kate should have access
and upload to our channel after each Webinar. I can do the initial
uploads and I'll make instructions for Kate and everyone that wants to
participates in OWASP Media Project.

Thanks you Kate and OWASP Global Webinar, I think this will be a great
add into our content and it will be the first recurring content that we
got. I'm also pretty sure it will help boost the viewership of the Webinars.

- Jonathan

Hi Kate and Ahmed,

OWASP Media project is glad to welcome any help.

I think that now we should focus on the future Webinars and uploading
the past ones.

We need to check if the Webinar default format is working when uploaded
on YouTube so that Kate (or someone in charge of the Webinar) can do it
by herself instead of the old process that was sending it to Matt and
then put it on the wiki. The YouTube way should be easier.

Ahmed, would you like to help with that and gather past Webinars and
then upload them into our YouTube?

Also, let me know if you have prior experience on YouTube, if not I'd
prefer to brief you first before giving you full access to the channel
so we can be on the same page.

Last but not least, please subscribe to
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp_media_project in order to
keep everyone up to date.

Thanks,

Just to keep the list updated with progress.

See bellow for exchanges with https://www.youtube.com/user/ChRiStIaAn008

That made me thinks that we need to watch for monetization. In the
current case Christian doesn't have it enabled, but we should watch for
other channel if they do - OWASP content should be freely accessible AND
people shouldn't make money out of it.

That said, since we are recognized as a non-profit on Google, we can
have our publicity that are promoting our organization. I'll add that to
the roadmap.

Next thing is synchronization with conferences, I have exchanged with
AppSecEU and will keep this list updated on what we are gonna do. I
think that this can lead OWASP Media Project to be more than just a
YouTube channel - in the long run we might provide help on recording and
streaming of content for conference, hardware included.

Hi Jonathan,

Thanks for your e-mail.
Great that OWASP has created a YouTube channel and is starting to put
the created content on YouTube.

Regarding monetization, I don't monetize the content on my channel.
The idea behind the channel is that videos can be found in one YouTube
channel and it's for educational purposes. Sort of like a central hub
via collaboration with other YouTubers, security enthousiasts and
organizers of security conferences.

The only time videos are monetized is when they match with content in
the YouTube copyright system, I get a copyright notice and most of the
time try to respond with fair-use policy so the copyright claim is
dropped. When the claim isn't dropped the original copyright holder will
get the revenue from the ads.

I've read the OWASP project, seems like great initiative and would
gladly help. How can I help?
I've added the OWASP channel to the collaborations module on my YouTube
channel page.

Best regards,
Christiaan Colen

Hi OWASP Media Project list,

I'm here to welcome Ahmed M Neil to our team as a project contributor.

Ahmed is motivated to help OWASP Media Project grows and be more visible
within OWASP.

His first target will be the Webinar that we will integrate within the
YouTube channel with some help from Nirmal.

In the future he's also interested on expanding the Global Chapter
Meetups and introducing Media Project to chapter leaders.

His help is a great timing because we are getting close to the 30k views
global on YouTube with 25k and this is our next expand step.

Thanks,
