Hi Fabio,

it is later in my roapmap and it will probably be something like call for
actions to get members rather than publicity.

The YouTube model is made for a large amount of views and it actually shows
random publicity.. this doesn't work with the OWASP model of having
sponsors and can cause actual troubles with conference.

Thanks,

- Jonathan
