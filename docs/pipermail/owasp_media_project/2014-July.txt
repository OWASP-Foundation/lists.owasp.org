Subject: [OWASP Media Project] Hey guys
Message-ID: <CAE+ehu7ywn_KpQrOMgpH+5niiCUHCgYC9LwqVNvEqjyjMRee3A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there

After seeing the last livecast, I was wondering if you guys could use some
help.

OWASP is my favorite infosec-related organization and, imho, the only one
actually doing anything worthwhile in giving back to the community.

Because of this, I see the media that is presented by OWASP as being
incredibly important in forwarding the cause of competance in our
professional community which I see as sorely lacking in general.

I'd like to assist with making better media materials for sharing on the
internet.  I'm seeing the following basic needs after reviewing what has
already been posted:
- better speaker video capture
- better presentation materials capture
- better post-processing to ad polish, additional resources, and notes

Let me know if I can help.

-i

PS: if this has been discussed already at length, please reply directly to
me with an archive link as I don't want to waste the lists time.

Hi Ian,

we will gladly accept any help!

Can you be specific on how you could help with video capture and
presentation material. Also, can you describe what you think of current
contents, and that will all conference content not just the latest one.

Note that each conference as it's own way of capturing content and we
are starting to get geared for more options globally.

And last, from which geographical region are you?

We currently have a team in Europe and we are looking for people in the USA.

Thanks,

- Jonathan

Well.  With zero additional resources or budget than just myself showing
up, I'd approach things in this way:
- Use my Canon 7D to capture HD video of the presenter
- Usually capture of presentation materials is super bad.  I find that
decks are better captured in post-production and the recorded content
integrated into the video easily.
- Capture of audio for the web can use any format or input

Yes this is absolutely the way it has been done previously and generally
everyone creates a very poor work product that our peers and constituents
won't enjoy viewing, so they don't.

Streams are always clearly an afterthought because everyone should have
unlimited time and resources to attend the 500 cons that happen a year.
 The content that the CCC people make is pretty good, posted quickly and
for free in HD, and has been for years.  Everyone else does an amazingly
poor job considering we're all supposed to be world class technocrats and
some cons even employ professional production companies who do bad work.
 Why is the work product so bad under these circumstances?  I wish I knew.

Non-perfect examples: http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2013/  Keep in
mind that most of these were produced in real time from the stream content
with minimal post-production effort, I suspect.

My take on the subject is that if it's worth the time and effort for people
to come and present at the conferences that we put together, we might as
well put forth the small effort of creating worthwhile content for people
who are unable to attend or want to share the content provided to enrich
others.

I'm not saying that we can go straight to flawless streaming (as that's
pretty hard and things happen), but having some polished work afterward at
some point would be a lot better than present and easily achievable.  DSLR
rentals (should our volunteer resources fall short) are also quite cheap,
ubiquitous, and just about everything can capture 1080p nowadays.  Plug a
laptop into the sound board output (for normal speaking venues) or straight
into the mic, and you have speaker video and good-enough audio.

Is there a demo?  Add HD capture from the device.

Combine with a deck playthrough with the speaker in a window and a couple
of title panes.  Throw some names under panelists.  Suddenly it's better
than just about anyone has done before outside of Deutschland.

It's all super easy now.  I learned this stuff for the first time when it
was hard and required specialty equipment.  Now most of the process is free
and the software is grandma-accessible.  I don't see any excuses for not
doing it.


> And last, from which geographical region are you?

I'm in Seattle presently.  Happy to go wherever though I usually don't
attend many cons anymore because they tend to be a waste of time unless
you're a salesman or are speaking.  I've heard many peers echo this lately.
 It's a bad trend and we should find a better way to foster discussion with
our educational institutions crumbling or teaching bad/old/weak content.
 Who else will step up if not groups like OWASP?

You're in luck!

Best,

Hi Ian,

thanks for your comments it's greatly appreciated.

I haven't have the time to do a "report" on what we did at last AppSecEU
but we had pretty good camera hardware (Panasonic AGHMC41; Panasonic
AGHMC151).

If you want to backtrack what we've done there's some email post in the
archive for this, notably:
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp_media_project/2013-December/000033.html
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp_media_project/2014-May/000051.html

That said, I'm agreeing with you on the quality parts, but we have
limitations we should consider (and you named some):
- Every setup for every conference will be different as we change venue
each year in OWASP (in other conference they often stay at the same place)
- Quality of audio will ALWAYS depend on the room and local staff except
if we have a dedicated wireless mic for streaming and that can be more
problematic
- Everyone will have their view on what a stream should be.
- Costs and budget. We will never have a big budget for streaming,
however we can have a decent one.

For the capture part, I'm fairly sure that "tapping" the video stream is
one good option. We have bought 3 X-CAPTURE-1
http://solarisjapan.com/products/xcapture-1-usb-3-0-hd-capture-unit to
stream the cameras at AppSecEU and it worked fine. Only limitation is
that it is Windows (DirectX) compatible only but they capture the
greatest range of outputs on earth for that price (around 350$USD).

The only problem I have with this is the position of the laptop that is
connected to the capture card. At AppSecEU, the filming was done from
the back of the room.

I'm really a prototype trying kind of guy and you can see the different
output we got:

direct capture of the screen with google hangout + Zoom H1
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG80aEXBZV9lk5nkEf3q-jaz

proprietary software with provided laptops and post audio mixing from
room pro audio (worked pretty badly as we missed many talks)
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG8ODR2zWs06JkMmlRiLyBXU

open broadcaster software + x-capture-1 hd input + panasonic pro camera
+ xlr input from room pro audio
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG_KHsxepT9o6trkqDELhr3_

At the point we are now, I think the solution is to use the X-CAPTURE-1
to have a "tap" on VGA and RCA audio from the room audio. Then, we use a
webcam for the presenter.

The reason I'm going towards that is that it is the most cost efficient
setup and we don't need the presenter face in HD. People are here for
the slides and demo outputs. I also want a setup that works for live
event or recording. So doing offline post is out of option. The webcam
is just because it will serve as a capture device over the X-CAPTURE-1.

I'll be beta testing this in OWASP Montreal's talks (often in French):
https://www.youtube.com/user/owaspmontreal/videos


If you are motivated to contribute I think we could use someone like you
who seems to have experience with all this and most importantly wants to
have great content online.

Our roadmap is here
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Road_Map_and_Getting_Involved
but I think that with time we will actually shape the way streaming is
made within all OWASP. In my opinion OWASP is not a big corporation and
neither just a local conference, so we could be one of the great source
of free video content regarding appsec on the net (I think we already
are, but could be better).

The next big thing is AppSecUSA in Denver, but they will manage
themselves their own recording and streaming options. I'll be
"consulting" them to make sure it is as best as we could but I just plan
managing the upload of content on YouTube after the conference (will be
easier that way). I'll try to make contents from the Project Summit but
this will be way easier as I will just use a hangout setup.

By the way, consider yourself "in" the OWASP Media Project already. If
we need someone in Denver I'll contact you since you are somewhat close.

Thanks for jumping in,

- Jonathan
