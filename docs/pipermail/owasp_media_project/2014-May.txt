Hi OWASP Media Project list,

this is to keep a trace in the project in order to understand what I'm
doing in the behalf of the project.

I'm still pursuing the road map
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Road_Map_and_Getting_Involved)
and now working on preparing the collection of video contents from
AppSecEU 2014 and assimilating the Webinar. All that is going pretty well.

Aside from following the road map I'm also responding to emails that are
mainly random comments on multimedia content on OWASP Leaders list that
seems to ignore the existence of our project.

I'm pretty sure it's a communication problem, as one person cannot not
everything about OWASP, but I sometime get ignored when replying directly.

I put much respect on board members are everyone that is involved with
OWASP, but at some point I had to answer directly to them. I just hope
it's not interpreted as personal criticism since I'm very passionate
about OWASP Media Project and addressing them directly. In each
communication I try to be direct to the point while keeping respect.

I'll copy at the end of this email my two last communications and will
keep you posted with updates.

Thanks,

 - Jonathan Marcil

Hi Michael and whoever who might be interested,

I was wondering, did you knew that OWASPGLOBAL channel had nearly one
thousand subscribers and close to 40k views?

Did you also knew that these subscribers would have received notice of
the live event when they go to YouTube, thus giving you more view? Same
goes for the recorded version.

Did you know that we can easily feature it on owasp.org front page using
the channel?

And more importantly, did you knew that using OWASP official channel is
the same as having your own channel, only that you have to switch
account to page in Google? The only difference it would make is the name
next to the video, it would be "OWASP".

Perhaps I should be selling better the OWASP Media Project, but it
baffle me each time someone make their own content on a personal channel
when it's clearly fitting with an official channel.

Thanks,

OWASP Leaders,

For the past 2.5 years, the OWASP Austin Chapter has been experimenting
with live broadcasting and recording our meetings.  With the creation of
the OWASP Vimeo account, we have set up a new permanent home for these
videos at https://vimeo.com/channels/owaspaustin.  Everything, including
our meeting from yesterday, is available for you to review.  Our setup
has evolved over the years so you'll notice a marked improvement in the
audio quality from when we first started to today.  Unfortunately, our
current setup is not something that is easily replicated because we use
the phone and audio integration provided in the meeting room by our
host.  That said, I documented our old configuration for webinars up
(attached) and for about $350, your chapter can have a pretty decent
setup for recording your meetings as well.  Just imagine how cool it
would be if OWASP had thousands of videos in our archive captured from
chapter meetings around the world.  Talk about exposure!  If you have
any questions, please let me know.

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol

Hi Josh,

unfortunately what you are telling there is kind of outdated on some
points and goes not in the same direction as OWASP Media Project. On
other points, you are spot on with the project, but just don't point to
it when it's clearly in it's goals.

First, we were supposed to drop the payment to the official OWASP Vimeo
channel to have HD content and other whatnot since all the videos for
the conferences are now uploaded to YouTube trough OWASP Media Project.
I spoke with Kate or Sarah or Samantha (can't remember who) quite a
while ago about this.

Next, we are looking to replace GotoMeeting with Google Hangout+YouTube
since GotoMeeting doesn't work on Linux and publishing is way easier
that way. This is in Kate's hands and I exchanged emails with her and
Samantha in the past weeks about it.

I don't understand why you didn't think of contacting OWASP Media
Project because I think everyone at OWASP Global are working with that
in mind and knows about our plan. I think it's a miscommunication
problem and I should address it better, but I don't know how to get the
attention from OWASP Leaders more than I already do with reports and
replies from time to time. Maybe having help from a board member can do it?

That said, I know I can't force chapters or anyone to use a specific
technology, but you somewhat proposed to go to Vimeo when all the
efforts are elsewhere since quite a while. We are at 96 videos since
only 8-9 months and more than 40,000 views on YouTube. I'm not asking to
merge or copy old stuff to YouTube, but just to be consistent with what
we do for something that large and central.

I'm really sorry for all that misunderstanding and I hope we can manage
something to get our (as the OWASP community) stuff together.

Hi everyone,

I'm glad to announce that Josh joined this mailing list and will
possibly contribute to Media Project.

Following what I've put in my last "State of affair" thread, we
discussed more and it has been very constructive. You can view our
exchange on owasp-leaders list here:
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2014-May/011628.html
http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2014-May/011630.html

Josh is involved on Vimeo with the Austin chapter:
http://vimeo.com/channels/owaspaustin/videos

He is also interested in encouraging multimedia content for chapters and
doing a "video in a box" that could fit with Media Project goals as well.

So welcome aboard Josh!

Thanks for the intro Jonathan!  I've been involved with the creation and
delivery of live and recorded content for the OWASP Austin Chapter and
LASCON since 2010.  We've been through multiple different setups and I can
definitely provide advice on what works and what does not.  My personal
goal is to expand this project to include chapter content, in addition to
the conference content you already maintain.  And as Jonathan mentioned, I
have some thoughts on a video in a box setup to get chapters up and running
with their own content in no time.  In any case, I thank Jonathan for the
invite to join and will do my best to contribute to the team.

Hi Michael,

this is great news for Media Project as we continue to spread awareness
with the project. I'm sure the community call will also get more
exposure from this.

I added you as a related project on Media Project wiki page, but really
the promotion of the Community Updates will be with the YouTube channel
once you are integrated with it.

I've made a playlist where you'll be able to put future recording easily
in OWASP Global channel :
http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG-Ju2GQva18XVK85n-E-ZPA

To broadcast onto our official channel, it's the same steps except that
you did with previous Hangouts with the exception of having to switch
account to OWASP Media Project. See "YouTube + Hangout streaming
procedure" on our wiki page:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Help
I just added you as a manager so you are good to go and you'll want to
join our mailing list since with that access you have access to
everything (that's a limitation with have at the moment).


I think every "global reaching" multimedia contributions such as yours
with "OWASP Community Call" should be published directly from Media
Project in order to join our efforts and get more views. But for less
globally related content, let's say the local chapters meetings, they
can use our methods to do their own channel and then we will link to
them like we do on that page:
https://www.youtube.com/user/OWASPGLOBAL/channels
They can also chose to be on any platform they want as we are looking to
support Vimeo as well with Josh's help: http://vimeo.com/owasp

Note that Media Project is still a big work in progress and right now we
are focusing on getting the conferences content right and integrating
compatible concepts such as the OWASP Community Call and the Webinars.


Thanks,

Message-ID: <CAFwvDewY6766ga+yBtuaBiEoSbYorJgGV7c1x4ihEnfYpNDo0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I've been playing around a bit with the new Ning 3.0 platform.  One of the
cool new features that I found is the ability to import and view RSS feeds
as part of the application.  The cool thing is that both YouTube and Vimeo
offer RSS feeds so this may be something that provides the ability to
combine all of these different feeds into a single location.  Check it out:

http://myowasp2.ning.com/videos

The "Videos" link at the second to last link is what I'm talking about.  I
told it to just display the titles, but it can do images and text as well.
Pretty neat and it automatically updates when new stuff is posted to the
channel.

On a related note, I tried to do this with:

OWASP Omaha = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPw8qTCFmWC2D0nGEi3MeXg
OWASP Poznan = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmQdgdrKZtfypJgHEop4fZg
OWASP Penang = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHBQqpuM5gcZdfcCOt9Pmsw

But note that the channel is just a reference and no name has been
assigned?  I wasn't able to figure out the RSS syntax for this instead of a
username.  Think we can get the usernames updated for those channels?

Let me know what you guys think of this.

Even better.  The Ning 3.0 has the ability to create "social channels" for
both YouTube and Vimeo providing a cohesive look and feel and allowing you
to effectively play the videos within the website itself.  Check out
http://myowasp2.ning.com/videos/ and let me know what you think!

Hi Josh,

currently I see a 404 error for the link you provided.

To answer your question, using:

https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/base/users/OWASPGLOBAL/uploads?alt=rss&v=2&orderby=published

https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/base/users/UCPw8qTCFmWC2D0nGEi3MeXg/uploads?alt=rss&v=2&orderby=published

give me the right feeds.

Thanks,

- Jonathan

Wow, it looks nice and it just show how good we can integrate Vimeo and
YouTube easily!

Yeah, it definitely does a good job of making the two technologies work
together rather seamlessly.  If you'd like, I think I can add you as an
administrator to help create more content pages.

FYI, I did discover one bug in that if you select a tab other than the
default (like "Austin" under the Chapters) and click on a video, it doesn't
play like it should.  You have to go back to the default ("Atlanta" in this
case) and then it will display.  I've submitted a bug report to Ning about
that.

Hi everyone,

I updated the documentation on OWASP Media Project to reflect what we
covered the other day with the staff "training":
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects/OWASP_Media_Project/Help#YouTube_.2B_Hangout_streaming_procedure

I've put some linked screenshots as well.

Also, you'll now be able to clearly see that you are on the YouTube
Google+ Page :
