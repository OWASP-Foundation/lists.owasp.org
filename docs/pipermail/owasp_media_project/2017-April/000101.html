<PRE>Hello there,

I'd like to initiate the official transition from OWASP Media Project to
OWASP staff in order to manage the global channel.

By doing so, I'd like also to close down the OWASP Media Project. This also
concerns Amelia as she's a co-leader. I know she's aligned with me on this
but I'll let her state her position.

I had a talk with Matt at last AppSecCali and it really does make sense to
get rid of it as a project. Of course the YouTube channel will stay.

Here's the final steps of what I want to achieve with the project:

   - Close down the Media Project page as inactive or retired (don't delete
   the page)
   - Upload the remaining keynotes of AppSecUSA 2016 into YouTube
   - Give ownership to Claudia of the YouTube Channel (invitation sent)
   - Give access to Kate (done) &amp; Matt too (invitation sent)


Provides the following last words guidelines:

   - Due to the nature of YouTube, management access to the global channel
   should be treated in the same fashion as write access to the
   www.owasp.org page.
   - Chapters should be encouraged to have their own channels as one
   YouTube channel doesn't scale that well globally.
   - Listen to people ideas if they get what YouTube is (real users) and
   follow the principles of OWASP (no commercial promotion, make appsec
   visible)
   - Conferences are now invited to pay for professional recording as the
   prices have now become more affordable than when we first started this.
   - Celebrate when we'll hit 1,000,000 views :-)


I'd like to take this email opportunity to thank everyone of you that
helped us in the project in order to achive the half millions views we
hitted:

   - OWASP Global Chapter Meetings Project: Yvan Boily
   - Nirmal Lama Titung &amp; Ahmed Neil
   - AppSec California Team: Kristian Erik Hermansen, Neil Matatall,
   Alexander Braehler
   - EU Students Team: Christian Dresen, Julian Held, Rene Boeing, Maik
   Dankel
   - USA Denver Team: Amelia Graycen, Tom Joy, Niko, Zach Lummis, Kyle
   Archer
   - USA San Francisco Team: Amelia Graycen, Katherine Carpenter, Neal
   Mueller

A big thanks also to Kate, Claudia and Kelly for their supports during
those years.

Oh and shootout to Martin, Michael &amp; Jim who also helped me with the
project at some points.

That all said, I won't be leaving OWASP as a leader, as now my time will be
focused on regular projects!

Thanks,

- Jonathan Marcil
