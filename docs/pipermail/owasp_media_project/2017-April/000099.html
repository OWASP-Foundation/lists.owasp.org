<PRE>Hello all,

apparently I should have checked my OWASP emails last week, but I was busy
with other things!

To clarify the roles in the Media Project, I'm the one mostly in charge of
accounts, and Amelia is editor/on site help.

Just to let you know that the YouTube channel doesn't have a password that
we can share.

You should also note that not just me and Amelia have access, but a few key
people from the board, the staff and regular volunteers from AppSec EU and
AppSec Cali.


I think it's a good idea to think about what we do with access management.
Should we give access to OWASP staff? Yes, it's already like that as Kate
has access! Should we give access to anyone who ask? No!.

The No is there for obvious security reason, but also, YouTube can be
really unforgiving with mistake made in upload. It can goes up to the
cancellation of the account or copyright laws strikes that put the channel
in a bad state.

In the current case Richard is totally legit and a good guy, but how do you
know?

I have also one question about what should be the response speed rate. For
now, it took me 8 days to receive Richard's request. Do we all think that
that's too long? I can tell you that problem like that never happens in EU,
because Martin's guys have permanent access. Also, the point of contact
from last year in AppSec Cali had already access, had my phone number and
I've contacted him in February without any response. I was actually waiting
on AppSec Cali and thinking of contacting Richard directly since a while
now, but that's like the first time I open my OWASP emails since it's email
last week. Bad timing!

If OWASP wants to change the model to be quicker, I'm all in for it, but
I'll advise to be careful still, by adding some rules such as that the
global channel is for &quot;global content only&quot; (yeah AppSecCali is so good
it's global quality :-).

Personally I'm at a point that I have to reconsider my implications as I'm
not a good candidate anymore to provide support for access control that are
quicker.


That all said, in any cases, all OWASP employees should have access and I
just added Claudia.

I think Claudia and me already had that discussion about how to manage the
YouTube channel at last BlackHat USA and it makes a lot of sense to change
it now like this: Basically the channel would be employee driven and OWASP
Media Project (an odd beast) would be a thing of the past.  Of course I'm
willing to provide some coaching with any OWASP employee that needs it too
in order to ensure proper transition.


Thanks all for all your implications as we have now reached the half a
million views milestone! :-)

  OWASP Media Project Co-Leader


PS: I'm dealing with Richard request on a separate thread, we'll give the
access ASAP
