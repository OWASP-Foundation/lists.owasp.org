<PRE>Hello,

turns out I forgot who's probably one of the most important person to thank
at this point: Ian Gorrie.

He expressed his desire to help with our YouTube channel in the future and
assist the OWASP staff for video captures during conferences as well. He's
also currently the one in charge of uploading AppSecCali videos. Big thanks
Ian!

After exchanging a few emails with him I can say he has the correct mindset
and determination it takes to continue what the Media Project started.

I have one question for Matt and the staff; can we still make sure that
someone that is helping the OWASP staff be considered as a leader still? Do
we have to keep the Media Project wiki structure? I'll let you decide at
that point. My plan was to archive the wiki project page, but if for any
reasons it's easier to keep it up, let me know. One thing that is for sure
is that we'll need a wiki page for listing the point of contacts and other
information.

Thanks all,

- Jonathan

&gt;<i> Hello there,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to initiate the official transition from OWASP Media Project to
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP staff in order to manage the global channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By doing so, I'd like also to close down the OWASP Media Project. This
</I>&gt;<i> also concerns Amelia as she's a co-leader. I know she's aligned with me on
</I>&gt;<i> this but I'll let her state her position.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had a talk with Matt at last AppSecCali and it really does make sense to
</I>&gt;<i> get rid of it as a project. Of course the YouTube channel will stay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the final steps of what I want to achieve with the project:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Close down the Media Project page as inactive or retired (don't
</I>&gt;<i>    delete the page)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Upload the remaining keynotes of AppSecUSA 2016 into YouTube
</I>&gt;<i>    - Give ownership to Claudia of the YouTube Channel (invitation sent)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Give access to Kate (done) &amp; Matt too (invitation sent)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Provides the following last words guidelines:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Due to the nature of YouTube, management access to the global
</I>&gt;<i>    channel should be treated in the same fashion as write access to the
</I>&gt;<i>    www.owasp.org page.
</I>&gt;<i>    - Chapters should be encouraged to have their own channels as one
</I>&gt;<i>    YouTube channel doesn't scale that well globally.
</I>&gt;<i>    - Listen to people ideas if they get what YouTube is (real users) and
</I>&gt;<i>    follow the principles of OWASP (no commercial promotion, make appsec
</I>&gt;<i>    visible)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Conferences are now invited to pay for professional recording as the
</I>&gt;<i>    prices have now become more affordable than when we first started this.
</I>&gt;<i>    - Celebrate when we'll hit 1,000,000 views :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to take this email opportunity to thank everyone of you that
</I>&gt;<i> helped us in the project in order to achive the half millions views we
</I>&gt;<i> hitted:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - OWASP Global Chapter Meetings Project: Yvan Boily
</I>&gt;<i>    - Nirmal Lama Titung &amp; Ahmed Neil
</I>&gt;<i>    - AppSec California Team: Kristian Erik Hermansen, Neil Matatall,
</I>&gt;<i>    Alexander Braehler
</I>&gt;<i>    - EU Students Team: Christian Dresen, Julian Held, Rene Boeing, Maik
</I>&gt;<i>    Dankel
</I>&gt;<i>    - USA Denver Team: Amelia Graycen, Tom Joy, Niko, Zach Lummis, Kyle
</I>&gt;<i>    Archer
</I>&gt;<i>    - USA San Francisco Team: Amelia Graycen, Katherine Carpenter, Neal
</I>&gt;<i>    Mueller
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A big thanks also to Kate, Claudia and Kelly for their supports during
</I>&gt;<i> those years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh and shootout to Martin, Michael &amp; Jim who also helped me with the
</I>&gt;<i> project at some points.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That all said, I won't be leaving OWASP as a leader, as now my time will
</I>&gt;<i> be focused on regular projects!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
