Subject: [OWASP Media Project] Let's not forget about the wiki...
Message-ID: <529BA7B0.8060600@owasp.org>

Hi everyone,

I was using the wiki to prepare a talk and I noticed that we didn't
really put out content, especially the AppSecUSA talks, on the wiki.

So I added them into:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Video

One thing we could do, but I don't know who to ask to have the
"approval" is to link OWASP Media Project with the front page using the
iframe that is already there, replacing the old video.

We just need this HTML code to replace the other one:
<iframe width="560" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG9g8l21uzfgyx4xAJ9aY7e7"
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I think it's probably only Matt that can do it.

Samantha, can you check for approval and then ask Matt to make the changes?

After we do this, changing what is shown on the front page will be as
easy to edit this playlist:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG9g8l21uzfgyx4xAJ9aY7e7

Thanks,

To be clear I just added one ugly link to the bunch of others that where
on the page that was already existing.

I'll put a note into Media Project in order to make that more appealing,
maybe when we will change the "front facing" system of owasp.org we
could have a pretty media page as well.

Thanks a lot for your clarifications,

- Jonathan

Jonathan,

I've actually never made changes to OWASP's wiki front page.  I've been
spending my time with the underlying software running the wiki rather then
the wiki itself if that makes sense.  I just updated the EmbedVideo
extension to use https for Youtube so we don't have mixed content on the
wiki.

There's only a hand full of people who are wiki admins and therefore can
update the front page.  If I recall correctly, Kate and Sarah are both
admins and can (and have) updated the front page.  There may be more admins
- I haven't looked at who has access to what on the wiki since the AppSec
LATAM conference in Montevideo.

BTW, the idea of a playlist is a brilliant way to integrate the wiki + the
media project.  I also agree that its sad that so much of our content isn't
presented directly or even just linked in the wiki.  Thanks for creating
the video page.  That represents some significant effort and a great win
for OWASP and our wiki.

So Jonathan,

Just to be clear... you want to replace the AppSec tutorial series video on
the home page with one of the new ones, and you need one of the admins to
do it?

Let me know.

TLDR; 11k views and 450 subscribers!


Hi Media Project list,

as you all know, we did a lot of work at last AppSecUSA in order to get
43 videos online for 32 hours for the talks, and also 6 videos from the
Project Summit for 2.5 hours of content. All of that was online live for
the summit and 24h after for the first talks, then the rest was
published in one week the week just after the conference.

I managed to get the Project Summit recording by myself, but for the
talks, it wouldn't have been possible without the support from AppSecUSA
who used their resources to help us with that. To make it clear, we had
a professional firm that recorded and uploaded the videos into YouTube.
The only work I did on my side was to organize them into a playlist and
publish them periodically.

AppSecUSA 2013 playlist
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG8ODR2zWs06JkMmlRiLyBXU

OWASP Projects Summit 2013 playlist
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG80aEXBZV9lk5nkEf3q-jaz

On the fail part, we missed some of the important talks, such as the
keynote because it was at the very beginning and also Jeremia's talk
that was a hit, but we achieved 77% publishing within one week. One
thing that actually wasn't real good in the short run was that the title
didn't contains "OWASP" nor "AppSecUSA". That will probably hurt us in
the long run and I might decide to change titles if we don't come out
first in search results (as for now we don't
https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=appsecusa).

We actually plan to do the same thing for AppSecUSA 2014 and I'll be in
touch with the team in order to prepare in advance. They want to have
live streaming and be as fast.

One thing that is sure, is that we need more people in OWASP Media
project. The good news is, unlike most other OWASP projects, you don't
need to be an application security specialist to be really useful, you
just need to be motivated to share knowledge with the world. I think that

Now for some stats, covering from Nov 17 2013 to Dec 19 2013.

We are at 11,289 views and 79,874 of estimated watched minutes.

Let me remind you that before that, we where at 245 views for 1,312
minutes, mainly from the OWASP Global Meetings live hangouts.

We are at 438 subscribers and we gained 442 of them with AppSecUSA
efforts. We lost 4 hence the numbers.

The average view duration is 7:04 minutes, so 16% of the total times of
videos. Since we have mostly one hour long videos, this is normal and in
fact is probably a great number.

Notables popular videos are
OWASP Zed Attack Proxy - Simon Bennetts
2,126 views 17,712 minutes watched 8:19 avg
http://youtu.be/pYFtLA2yTR8

Top Ten Proactive Controls - Jim Manico
845 views 8,293 minutes watched 9:48 avg
http://youtu.be/Cg5dN8Pyn_c

What You Didn't Know About XML External Entities Attacks - Timothy Morgan
790 views 5,857 minutes wathced 7:24 avg
http://youtu.be/eHSNT8vWLfc

>From what I saw, Simon's used his network to publish his videos and I
helped him by putting it as the trailer for the channel for a while.
Same with Jim but with less engagement from his network (less comments).
Timothy's was published from an external news website and got some views
trough that.

Finally, the following countries were the top viewership :
United States 37%
Canada 12%
India 4.5%
United Kingdom 4.0%

I must point out that we were watched in 114 countries. That's amazing
and shows the power of OWASP worldwide.

With that big first step done, we will continue with our roadmap
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Roadmap
and the next thing on the table is to present a Webinar on how to use
Google Hangout and try to setup the next webinars within our YouTube
channel. I also want to shake things with the Chapters by incite them to
use Hangout and YouTube in order to get more into the Global Chapter
Meetings Project. This has great potential but is not really used right
now for helping smaller chapters to get contents.

And and last, but not least, we are officially on the www.owasp.org home
page and we can control what is shown trough that small playlist:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG9g8l21uzfgyx4xAJ9aY7e7

Thanks to all who contributed and helped with OWASP Media Project,

See you next year!
