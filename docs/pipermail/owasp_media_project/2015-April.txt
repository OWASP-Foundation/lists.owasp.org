Subject: [OWASP Media Project] AppSec Cali - Great job on YouTube!
Message-ID: <553EE007.8000704@owasp.org>

Hi AppSec Cali guys,

great uploading jobs on YouTube! Descriptions and tags are very well done!

I see the vids are just two steps from publishing:
- Adding to AppSec Cali 2015 playlist
- Removing unlisted status

Do you have any plans to release?

I would suggest doing so by small bunches over a week.

Also, AppSecEU is coming in less than one month so you might want to do
that sooner than later.

Let me know what you'll do, I'll try to tweet them on @owasp as well so
we get max views.

Thanks,

--

Hi Jonathan,

Thanks! Everyone pitched in to help with the event descriptions and videos.

Yes, we were just discussing when to release them onto the public playlist.
I had sent the links out privately first to collect feedback. All the
feedback has been positive so far, so nothing is queued to be changed. At
this point, they are ready for release.

Sounds like a good idea. I can enable them for public release over the next
week or so starting today. If you think releasing / tweeting them out at
930am pacific time is preferable, let us know (this is what google does for
their public posts). I was looking on the OWASP Media Project wiki and
didn't see these details but let me know if this is standard and if I have
access to that wiki I will update it to reflect your recommendations...

Hi Kristian,

we currently don't have guidelines for "Publishing" but it sure can be a
section we need (that and "Basic quality requirements for recording").
Feel free to edit the wiki page if you like/can.

Do you want to use @AppSecCali for primary publishing and I'll retweet
on my side (I'm eastern time) with @owasp? It's better to retweet than
duplicate.

BTW I think I'll add you and Neil as project contributors since
AppSecCali is as involved as AppSecUSA/EU in a recurring fashion and you
are doing a stellar job at it.

Thanks,

- Jonathan

One links that is dynamic and great for generic spamming is the YouTube
playlist:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG-xWNB98Q2uLN7O8E91xJzK

That said, one vid per tweet is a good thing as well, and if you tag the
presenter it's an added bonus.

I'll also feature the whole thing on the YouTube channel and OWASP.org
tonight.

Hopefully we'll get a buzz out of this!

Thanks,

- Jonathan

Great stuff!

Only problem I have right now, is that when I retweet from @owasp, it
doesn't show as much as it used to in people's feeds. They changed the
retweet system not long ago.

It seems to help to quote the RT or maybe to fav as well.. I'll try
stuff to see what helps.

Thanks!

- Jonathan

I tweeted a link from @appseccali to the YouTube playlist yesterday. Within
one hour I will have also tweeted links to each individual video on that
playlist up to Amol Sarwate. Lots of retweets, favorites, and follows since
I started!
