Hello all,

apparently I should have checked my OWASP emails last week, but I was busy
with other things!

To clarify the roles in the Media Project, I'm the one mostly in charge of
accounts, and Amelia is editor/on site help.

Just to let you know that the YouTube channel doesn't have a password that
we can share.

You should also note that not just me and Amelia have access, but a few key
people from the board, the staff and regular volunteers from AppSec EU and
AppSec Cali.


I think it's a good idea to think about what we do with access management.
Should we give access to OWASP staff? Yes, it's already like that as Kate
has access! Should we give access to anyone who ask? No!.

The No is there for obvious security reason, but also, YouTube can be
really unforgiving with mistake made in upload. It can goes up to the
cancellation of the account or copyright laws strikes that put the channel
in a bad state.

In the current case Richard is totally legit and a good guy, but how do you
know?

I have also one question about what should be the response speed rate. For
now, it took me 8 days to receive Richard's request. Do we all think that
that's too long? I can tell you that problem like that never happens in EU,
because Martin's guys have permanent access. Also, the point of contact
from last year in AppSec Cali had already access, had my phone number and
I've contacted him in February without any response. I was actually waiting
on AppSec Cali and thinking of contacting Richard directly since a while
now, but that's like the first time I open my OWASP emails since it's email
last week. Bad timing!

If OWASP wants to change the model to be quicker, I'm all in for it, but
I'll advise to be careful still, by adding some rules such as that the
global channel is for "global content only" (yeah AppSecCali is so good
it's global quality :-).

Personally I'm at a point that I have to reconsider my implications as I'm
not a good candidate anymore to provide support for access control that are
quicker.


That all said, in any cases, all OWASP employees should have access and I
just added Claudia.

I think Claudia and me already had that discussion about how to manage the
YouTube channel at last BlackHat USA and it makes a lot of sense to change
it now like this: Basically the channel would be employee driven and OWASP
Media Project (an odd beast) would be a thing of the past.  Of course I'm
willing to provide some coaching with any OWASP employee that needs it too
in order to ensure proper transition.


Thanks all for all your implications as we have now reached the half a
million views milestone! :-)

- Jonathan Marcil
  OWASP Media Project Co-Leader


PS: I'm dealing with Richard request on a separate thread, we'll give the
access ASAP

Hello Amelia,

Just wanted to send you a friendly reminder to Richard's request below for
the APPSec videos.

If you would also share the credentials for the OWASP YouTube channel with
us to help you with future requests.

Thank you in advance for your time.

Subject: [OWASP Media Project] YouTube Channel Transition
Message-ID: <CAGzV9fwzc1nHtSFAsheWvjLKOi_EF6JmDq0Sv05GqSOEEgH0bQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello there,

I'd like to initiate the official transition from OWASP Media Project to
OWASP staff in order to manage the global channel.

By doing so, I'd like also to close down the OWASP Media Project. This also
concerns Amelia as she's a co-leader. I know she's aligned with me on this
but I'll let her state her position.

I had a talk with Matt at last AppSecCali and it really does make sense to
get rid of it as a project. Of course the YouTube channel will stay.

Here's the final steps of what I want to achieve with the project:

   - Close down the Media Project page as inactive or retired (don't delete
   the page)
   - Upload the remaining keynotes of AppSecUSA 2016 into YouTube
   - Give ownership to Claudia of the YouTube Channel (invitation sent)
   - Give access to Kate (done) & Matt too (invitation sent)


Provides the following last words guidelines:

   - Due to the nature of YouTube, management access to the global channel
   should be treated in the same fashion as write access to the
   www.owasp.org page.
   - Chapters should be encouraged to have their own channels as one
   YouTube channel doesn't scale that well globally.
   - Listen to people ideas if they get what YouTube is (real users) and
   follow the principles of OWASP (no commercial promotion, make appsec
   visible)
   - Conferences are now invited to pay for professional recording as the
   prices have now become more affordable than when we first started this.
   - Celebrate when we'll hit 1,000,000 views :-)


I'd like to take this email opportunity to thank everyone of you that
helped us in the project in order to achive the half millions views we
hitted:

   - OWASP Global Chapter Meetings Project: Yvan Boily
   - Nirmal Lama Titung & Ahmed Neil
   - AppSec California Team: Kristian Erik Hermansen, Neil Matatall,
   Alexander Braehler
   - EU Students Team: Christian Dresen, Julian Held, Rene Boeing, Maik
   Dankel
   - USA Denver Team: Amelia Graycen, Tom Joy, Niko, Zach Lummis, Kyle
   Archer
   - USA San Francisco Team: Amelia Graycen, Katherine Carpenter, Neal
   Mueller

A big thanks also to Kate, Claudia and Kelly for their supports during
those years.

Oh and shootout to Martin, Michael & Jim who also helped me with the
project at some points.

That all said, I won't be leaving OWASP as a leader, as now my time will be
focused on regular projects!

Thanks,

- Jonathan Marcil

Hi Jonathan,

There is one last open item that requires your attention. Would you mind please transitioning the AppSec Cali channel into the Global Channel? I had sent you a request yesterday. We need this to publish our videos. I built the channel, but Ian will be uploading them. I cannot currently give him rights to do so, without your assistance.

Thanks.

Hi Richard,

sorry but I think there's some confusions / missing updates in your last
message.

Ian has accepted his access 5 days ago to the OWASP Global Channel and can
publish on it since then:

[image: Inline image 1]




For the AppSec Cali channel, if you have created it, you are the sole
administrator of it. You are the one who can give manager access for
upload. There's is nothing such as transitioning channel in YouTube (we
cannot move the videos either). All I can do is to add links and embed
playlist from the global channel to the conference channel and that's what
I plan to do once your content goes public.


I just tried to give you a call, don't hesitate to call me if anything is
still unclear to you.

Thanks,

- Jonathan

Hello,

turns out I forgot who's probably one of the most important person to thank
at this point: Ian Gorrie.

He expressed his desire to help with our YouTube channel in the future and
assist the OWASP staff for video captures during conferences as well. He's
also currently the one in charge of uploading AppSecCali videos. Big thanks
Ian!

After exchanging a few emails with him I can say he has the correct mindset
and determination it takes to continue what the Media Project started.

I have one question for Matt and the staff; can we still make sure that
someone that is helping the OWASP staff be considered as a leader still? Do
we have to keep the Media Project wiki structure? I'll let you decide at
that point. My plan was to archive the wiki project page, but if for any
reasons it's easier to keep it up, let me know. One thing that is for sure
is that we'll need a wiki page for listing the point of contacts and other
information.

Thanks all,

- Jonathan
