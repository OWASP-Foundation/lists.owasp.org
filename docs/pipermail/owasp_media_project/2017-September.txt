Hello everyone,

the following changes have been made on the YouTube channel access:

- Tom Brennan, invited to upload (new livestream initiative)
- Andrew Van Der Stock, added as owner (board member)
- Ian Gorrie, moved back to communication manager (not upload) since the
upload for AppSecCali 2017 are done

Note that it's not usual to announce details about uploaders changes.
During a year, we pull people in and out of upload access in order to keep
the project manageable in the long run. Most of them are contractor or
people not involved more than one time.

I'd like to apologize if it caused any issues and state that we'll try to
do better in the future by notifying on this list as it caused confusion
multiple times in the past; I blame Google sending non-youtube-branded
emails notifications to people.

As a reminder, the OWASP Staff is now the base owner of the channel, but
that doesn't need that volunteers won't help with access management.
Amelia, Andrew and myself have access to change roles and often need to do
it on the stop during an event. YouTube is quite a mess to manage and we
have to do our best to keep it clean.

If you think you should have access or your access have been removed,
please provide us (by using the current mailing list) with a clear roadmap
with dates about your implication and we'll gladly add you back. It might
take up to 10 days so please be aware of that and don't request access last
minute.

Last but not least, please tell people to register to this mailing list for
any communication regarding the YouTube channel. Normally a single time
uploader is not required to register, but it's a must if you're going to be
involved long term.

Thank you all,

- Jonathan


PS1: Officially, I'm still Media Project Co-Lead with Amelia, but soon
we're going to transition into being an OWASP Resource and be just "OWASP
Leaders" based on our volunteering rather than a project structure.

PS2: brace yourself we're going to have some cool content related to the
Top 10 on top (ah!) of the awesome professional recordings from AppSecUSA
2017.

Can you please contact me by email or hangout chat jonathan.marcil at owasp.org
?

Right now you changed the privacy status of the AppSecUSA 2017 playlist,
and that's should have not been done.

This playlist was made Unlisted for a good reason as we need to review the
talks before they are being uploaded. Fortunately, we haven't started right
now, but I'll have to delete the current and recreated a new one since the
URL has leaked.

Thank you,

- Jonathan

My bad. I uploaded the leaders recorded session to youtube into the empty channel to allow all leaders to actually see and listen to the important discussion that took place for over 2hrs.  If there was special instructions I missed that guidance.

Hey Tom,

no problem for the video itself. The only problem was that the playlist was
used for other upload and needed not to be public yet.

We're not used to work at the same time as the different volunteers are
normally spread throughout the year, so this was a special case.

The good news is that your video can still be online and shown on the
channel without the need for a playlist. I've deleted the old playlist and
I will suggest you use the video link to distribute/advertise it over other
channels such as Twitter and mailing lists:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcM3hxmiMxg


For our YouTube only audience, they will receive the video in their
watch-list (called subscription), and the result will be on the YouTube
page like this:

I'll take care myself of adding it to the official AppSecUSA 2017 playlist
once it will be ready to be published.

Thanks,

- Jonathan
