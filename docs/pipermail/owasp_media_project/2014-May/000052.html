&gt;<i> Hi OWASP Media Project list,

</I>&gt;<i> this is to keep a trace in the project in order to understand what I'm

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still pursuing the road map

</I>&gt;<i> and now working on preparing the collection of video contents from
</I>&gt;<i> AppSecEU 2014 and assimilating the Webinar. All that is going pretty well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aside from following the road map I'm also responding to emails that are
</I>&gt;<i> mainly random comments on multimedia content on OWASP Leaders list that
</I>&gt;<i> seems to ignore the existence of our project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm pretty sure it's a communication problem, as one person cannot not
</I>&gt;<i> everything about OWASP, but I sometime get ignored when replying directly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I put much respect on board members are everyone that is involved with

</I>&gt;<i> it's not interpreted as personal criticism since I'm very passionate
</I>&gt;<i> about OWASP Media Project and addressing them directly. In each
</I>&gt;<i> communication I try to be direct to the point while keeping respect.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Michael and whoever who might be interested,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was wondering, did you knew that OWASPGLOBAL channel had nearly one
</I>&gt;<i> thousand subscribers and close to 40k views?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did you also knew that these subscribers would have received notice of
</I>&gt;<i> the live event when they go to YouTube, thus giving you more view? Same
</I>&gt;<i> goes for the recorded version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did you know that we can easily feature it on owasp.org front page using
</I>&gt;<i> the channel?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And more importantly, did you knew that using OWASP official channel is
</I>&gt;<i> the same as having your own channel, only that you have to switch
</I>&gt;<i> account to page in Google? The only difference it would make is the name
</I>&gt;<i> next to the video, it would be &quot;OWASP&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps I should be selling better the OWASP Media Project, but it
</I>&gt;<i> baffle me each time someone make their own content on a personal channel
</I>&gt;<i> when it's clearly fitting with an official channel.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> For the past 2.5 years, the OWASP Austin Chapter has been experimenting

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Josh,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately what you are telling there is kind of outdated on some
</I>&gt;<i> points and goes not in the same direction as OWASP Media Project. On
</I>&gt;<i> other points, you are spot on with the project, but just don't point to
</I>&gt;<i> it when it's clearly in it's goals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, we were supposed to drop the payment to the official OWASP Vimeo
</I>&gt;<i> channel to have HD content and other whatnot since all the videos for
</I>&gt;<i> the conferences are now uploaded to YouTube trough OWASP Media Project.
</I>&gt;<i> I spoke with Kate or Sarah or Samantha (can't remember who) quite a
</I>&gt;<i> while ago about this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Next, we are looking to replace GotoMeeting with Google Hangout+YouTube
</I>&gt;<i> since GotoMeeting doesn't work on Linux and publishing is way easier
</I>&gt;<i> that way. This is in Kate's hands and I exchanged emails with her and
</I>&gt;<i> Samantha in the past weeks about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand why you didn't think of contacting OWASP Media
</I>&gt;<i> Project because I think everyone at OWASP Global are working with that
</I>&gt;<i> in mind and knows about our plan. I think it's a miscommunication
</I>&gt;<i> problem and I should address it better, but I don't know how to get the
</I>&gt;<i> attention from OWASP Leaders more than I already do with reports and
</I>&gt;<i> replies from time to time. Maybe having help from a board member can do it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I know I can't force chapters or anyone to use a specific
</I>&gt;<i> technology, but you somewhat proposed to go to Vimeo when all the
</I>&gt;<i> efforts are elsewhere since quite a while. We are at 96 videos since
</I>&gt;<i> only 8-9 months and more than 40,000 views on YouTube. I'm not asking to
</I>&gt;<i> merge or copy old stuff to YouTube, but just to be consistent with what
</I>&gt;<i> we do for something that large and central.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm really sorry for all that misunderstanding and I hope we can manage
</I>&gt;<i> something to get our (as the OWASP community) stuff together.
</I>&gt;<i>
