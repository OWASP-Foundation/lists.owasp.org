<PRE>Hi OWASP Media Project list,

this is to keep a trace in the project in order to understand what I'm
doing in the behalf of the project.

I'm still pursuing the road map
(<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Road_Map_and_Getting_Involved">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Road_Map_and_Getting_Involved</A>)
and now working on preparing the collection of video contents from
AppSecEU 2014 and assimilating the Webinar. All that is going pretty well.

Aside from following the road map I'm also responding to emails that are
mainly random comments on multimedia content on OWASP Leaders list that
seems to ignore the existence of our project.

I'm pretty sure it's a communication problem, as one person cannot not
everything about OWASP, but I sometime get ignored when replying directly.

I put much respect on board members are everyone that is involved with
OWASP, but at some point I had to answer directly to them. I just hope
it's not interpreted as personal criticism since I'm very passionate
about OWASP Media Project and addressing them directly. In each
communication I try to be direct to the point while keeping respect.

I'll copy at the end of this email my two last communications and will
keep you posted with updates.

Thanks,

Hi Michael and whoever who might be interested,

I was wondering, did you knew that OWASPGLOBAL channel had nearly one
thousand subscribers and close to 40k views?

Did you also knew that these subscribers would have received notice of
the live event when they go to YouTube, thus giving you more view? Same
goes for the recorded version.

Did you know that we can easily feature it on owasp.org front page using
the channel?

And more importantly, did you knew that using OWASP official channel is
the same as having your own channel, only that you have to switch
account to page in Google? The only difference it would make is the name
next to the video, it would be &quot;OWASP&quot;.

Perhaps I should be selling better the OWASP Media Project, but it
baffle me each time someone make their own content on a personal channel
when it's clearly fitting with an official channel.

Thanks,

OWASP Leaders,

For the past 2.5 years, the OWASP Austin Chapter has been experimenting
with live broadcasting and recording our meetings.  With the creation of
the OWASP Vimeo account, we have set up a new permanent home for these
videos at <A HREF="https://vimeo.com/channels/owaspaustin.">https://vimeo.com/channels/owaspaustin.</A>  Everything, including
our meeting from yesterday, is available for you to review.  Our setup
has evolved over the years so you'll notice a marked improvement in the
audio quality from when we first started to today.  Unfortunately, our
current setup is not something that is easily replicated because we use
the phone and audio integration provided in the meeting room by our
host.  That said, I documented our old configuration for webinars up
(attached) and for about $350, your chapter can have a pretty decent
setup for recording your meetings as well.  Just imagine how cool it
would be if OWASP had thousands of videos in our archive captured from
chapter meetings around the world.  Talk about exposure!  If you have
any questions, please let me know.

Sincerely,

Josh Sokol

OWASP Global Board of Directors

Hi Josh,

unfortunately what you are telling there is kind of outdated on some
points and goes not in the same direction as OWASP Media Project. On
other points, you are spot on with the project, but just don't point to
it when it's clearly in it's goals.

First, we were supposed to drop the payment to the official OWASP Vimeo
channel to have HD content and other whatnot since all the videos for
the conferences are now uploaded to YouTube trough OWASP Media Project.
I spoke with Kate or Sarah or Samantha (can't remember who) quite a
while ago about this.

Next, we are looking to replace GotoMeeting with Google Hangout+YouTube
since GotoMeeting doesn't work on Linux and publishing is way easier
that way. This is in Kate's hands and I exchanged emails with her and
Samantha in the past weeks about it.

I don't understand why you didn't think of contacting OWASP Media
Project because I think everyone at OWASP Global are working with that
in mind and knows about our plan. I think it's a miscommunication
problem and I should address it better, but I don't know how to get the
attention from OWASP Leaders more than I already do with reports and
replies from time to time. Maybe having help from a board member can do it?

That said, I know I can't force chapters or anyone to use a specific
technology, but you somewhat proposed to go to Vimeo when all the
efforts are elsewhere since quite a while. We are at 96 videos since
only 8-9 months and more than 40,000 views on YouTube. I'm not asking to
merge or copy old stuff to YouTube, but just to be consistent with what
we do for something that large and central.

I'm really sorry for all that misunderstanding and I hope we can manage
something to get our (as the OWASP community) stuff together.

Thanks,
