Added (pending) Pauline as manager to help Victor with the uploads of
AppSecCali 2018 recordings.

Cleaned 2 pending invites we had since more than 1 year (those people are
not involved anymore).

Switched to Communication Manager (no editing rights) 5 retired board
members that doesn't use the site anyways (so far Andrew is the only active
board member I know that has access).
