Hey list,

I've had a few out of band conversations about what media should be
produced by high profile owasp conferences and they've all been pretty
disjointed.

It's my goal to try to refine something akin to a ccc talk video out of the
process, but there seems to be a lot of fairly intractable opinions in
place and, perhaps, ruffled jimmies at calling someones baby ugly.

Has this group produced any generic recommendations at polished video
production for owasp events?  I've seen a lot of things flying around but
no standard.

I would like to help develop one so that it's not a mess on the next
occasion so that the past doesn't repeat itself.

Please feel free to email me directly, use owasp gchat, or find me on the
owasp slack to discuss as I'd rather pick up where someone left off instead
of starting from scratch.

Best,

-i
