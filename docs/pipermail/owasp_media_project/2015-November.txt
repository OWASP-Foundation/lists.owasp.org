I've been meaning to write/update a wiki page about a conference capture
howto and looking to evangelize making videos well for all conferences and
putting the materials on the internet that I talk to people about. The
condition that I use when people want to use my help for free is that it me
posted on the owasp youtube channel when it's done.

I've mentioned to a couple of people, like the people who were putting on
owasp appsec in LA, that they should do some things differently but I
didn't have a place to point them, so I requested a wiki credential and
then completely forgot about it until now.

Also it doesn't look like there was a project channel in the owasp slack
instance, so I made #owasp-media just now.

Have there been any updates?  Should we chats in slack or have a call?

Best,
