<PRE>Hello everyone,

the following changes have been made on the YouTube channel access:

- Tom Brennan, invited to upload (new livestream initiative)
- Andrew Van Der Stock, added as owner (board member)
- Ian Gorrie, moved back to communication manager (not upload) since the
upload for AppSecCali 2017 are done

Note that it's not usual to announce details about uploaders changes.
During a year, we pull people in and out of upload access in order to keep
the project manageable in the long run. Most of them are contractor or
people not involved more than one time.

I'd like to apologize if it caused any issues and state that we'll try to
do better in the future by notifying on this list as it caused confusion
multiple times in the past; I blame Google sending non-youtube-branded
emails notifications to people.

As a reminder, the OWASP Staff is now the base owner of the channel, but
that doesn't need that volunteers won't help with access management.
Amelia, Andrew and myself have access to change roles and often need to do
it on the stop during an event. YouTube is quite a mess to manage and we
have to do our best to keep it clean.

If you think you should have access or your access have been removed,
please provide us (by using the current mailing list) with a clear roadmap
with dates about your implication and we'll gladly add you back. It might
take up to 10 days so please be aware of that and don't request access last
minute.

Last but not least, please tell people to register to this mailing list for
any communication regarding the YouTube channel. Normally a single time
uploader is not required to register, but it's a must if you're going to be
involved long term.

Thank you all,

PS1: Officially, I'm still Media Project Co-Lead with Amelia, but soon
we're going to transition into being an OWASP Resource and be just &quot;OWASP
Leaders&quot; based on our volunteering rather than a project structure.

PS2: brace yourself we're going to have some cool content related to the
Top 10 on top (ah!) of the awesome professional recordings from AppSecUSA
2017.
