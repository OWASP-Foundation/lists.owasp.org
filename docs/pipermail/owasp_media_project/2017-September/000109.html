<PRE>Hey Tom,

no problem for the video itself. The only problem was that the playlist was
used for other upload and needed not to be public yet.

We're not used to work at the same time as the different volunteers are
normally spread throughout the year, so this was a special case.

The good news is that your video can still be online and shown on the
channel without the need for a playlist. I've deleted the old playlist and
I will suggest you use the video link to distribute/advertise it over other
channels such as Twitter and mailing lists:
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcM3hxmiMxg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcM3hxmiMxg</A>


For our YouTube only audience, they will receive the video in their
watch-list (called subscription), and the result will be on the YouTube
page like this:

I'll take care myself of adding it to the official AppSecUSA 2017 playlist
once it will be ready to be published.

Thanks,

- Jonathan
