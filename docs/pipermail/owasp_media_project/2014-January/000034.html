</I>&gt;<i> Hi Media Project list,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> as you all know, we did a lot of work at last AppSecUSA in order to get
</I>&gt;<i> 43 videos online for 32 hours for the talks, and also 6 videos from the
</I>&gt;<i> Project Summit for 2.5 hours of content. All of that was online live for
</I>&gt;<i> the summit and 24h after for the first talks, then the rest was
</I>&gt;<i> published in one week the week just after the conference.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I managed to get the Project Summit recording by myself, but for the
</I>&gt;<i> talks, it wouldn't have been possible without the support from AppSecUSA
</I>&gt;<i> who used their resources to help us with that. To make it clear, we had
</I>&gt;<i> a professional firm that recorded and uploaded the videos into YouTube.
</I>&gt;<i> The only work I did on my side was to organize them into a playlist and
</I>&gt;<i> publish them periodically.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> AppSecUSA 2013 playlist

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the fail part, we missed some of the important talks, such as the
</I>&gt;<i> keynote because it was at the very beginning and also Jeremia's talk
</I>&gt;<i> that was a hit, but we achieved 77% publishing within one week. One
</I>&gt;<i> thing that actually wasn't real good in the short run was that the title
</I>&gt;<i> didn't contains &quot;OWASP&quot; nor &quot;AppSecUSA&quot;. That will probably hurt us in
</I>&gt;<i> the long run and I might decide to change titles if we don't come out
</I>&gt;<i> first in search results (as for now we don't
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=appsecusa">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=appsecusa</A>).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We actually plan to do the same thing for AppSecUSA 2014 and I'll be in
</I>&gt;<i> touch with the team in order to prepare in advance. They want to have
</I>&gt;<i> live streaming and be as fast.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One thing that is sure, is that we need more people in OWASP Media
</I>&gt;<i> project. The good news is, unlike most other OWASP projects, you don't
</I>&gt;<i> need to be an application security specialist to be really useful, you
</I>&gt;<i> just need to be motivated to share knowledge with the world. I think that
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now for some stats, covering from Nov 17 2013 to Dec 19 2013.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are at 11,289 views and 79,874 of estimated watched minutes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me remind you that before that, we where at 245 views for 1,312
</I>&gt;<i> minutes, mainly from the OWASP Global Meetings live hangouts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are at 438 subscribers and we gained 442 of them with AppSecUSA
</I>&gt;<i> efforts. We lost 4 hence the numbers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The average view duration is 7:04 minutes, so 16% of the total times of
</I>&gt;<i> videos. Since we have mostly one hour long videos, this is normal and in
</I>&gt;<i> fact is probably a great number.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Notables popular videos are
</I>&gt;<i> OWASP Zed Attack Proxy - Simon Bennetts
</I>&gt;<i> 2,126 views 17,712 minutes watched 8:19 avg
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://youtu.be/pYFtLA2yTR8">http://youtu.be/pYFtLA2yTR8</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Top Ten Proactive Controls - Jim Manico
</I>&gt;<i> 845 views 8,293 minutes watched 9:48 avg
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://youtu.be/Cg5dN8Pyn_c">http://youtu.be/Cg5dN8Pyn_c</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What You Didn't Know About XML External Entities Attacks - Timothy Morgan
</I>&gt;<i> 790 views 5,857 minutes wathced 7:24 avg
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://youtu.be/eHSNT8vWLfc">http://youtu.be/eHSNT8vWLfc</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>From what I saw, Simon's used his network to publish his videos and I
</I>&gt;<i> helped him by putting it as the trailer for the channel for a while.
</I>&gt;<i> Same with Jim but with less engagement from his network (less comments).
</I>&gt;<i> Timothy's was published from an external news website and got some views
</I>&gt;<i> trough that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, the following countries were the top viewership :
</I>&gt;<i> United States 37%
</I>&gt;<i> Canada 12%
</I>&gt;<i> India 4.5%
</I>&gt;<i> United Kingdom 4.0%
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I must point out that we were watched in 114 countries. That's amazing
</I>&gt;<i> and shows the power of OWASP worldwide.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With that big first step done, we will continue with our roadmap
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Roadmap">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Roadmap</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and the next thing on the table is to present a Webinar on how to use
</I>&gt;<i> Google Hangout and try to setup the next webinars within our YouTube
</I>&gt;<i> channel. I also want to shake things with the Chapters by incite them to
</I>&gt;<i> use Hangout and YouTube in order to get more into the Global Chapter
</I>&gt;<i> Meetings Project. This has great potential but is not really used right
</I>&gt;<i> now for helping smaller chapters to get contents.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And and last, but not least, we are officially on the www.owasp.org home
</I>&gt;<i> page and we can control what is shown trough that small playlist:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG9g8l21uzfgyx4xAJ9aY7e7">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG9g8l21uzfgyx4xAJ9aY7e7</A>

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to all who contributed and helped with OWASP Media Project,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See you next year!
