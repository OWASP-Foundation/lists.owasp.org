<PRE>Hi OWASP Media Project list,

since we are an official meaning of communication for OWASP, I think we
should read, understand and apply OWASP policy on social media:
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Governance/Social_Media_Policy">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Governance/Social_Media_Policy</A>

I have personally signed it and I'll enforce it as my &quot;overseer&quot; role in
Media Project. I have also access to OWASP blog and OWASP Twitter
account. Plans are that we will use Twitter for promoting videos or
playlist.

For all new comers into the project, I'll let you read the complete
policy from above, but I'll put emphasis on these parts:

&quot;&quot;
Respect your audience. Don't use ethnic slurs, personal insults,
obscenity, or engage in any conduct that would not be acceptable under
OWASP&#8217;s Code of ethics and principles. You should also show proper
consideration for others privacy and for topics that may be considered
objectionable or inflammatory (like religion or politics).  We all
appreciate respect.

Vendor Neutrality - Please respect OWASP&#8217;s vendor neutrality policy.
While thanking OWASP supporters and sponsors is an acceptable use of
OWASP social media accounts, using these accounts to sell or advertise
for company products or services is not acceptable.

Administration and Ownership of OWASP Social Media Accounts: Any person
with access to an OWASP social media account must sign a document
agreeing to the terms of this policy, acknowledging that OWASP owns the
account and may at any time transition usage and control of the account.
&quot;&quot;

On that last paragraph, I think that in our case, for the access to the
YouTube channel, we have it covered since we have a rule that is to make
me review any content before submitting, so technically I will be the
one who submits. It is a little rule bending, and we will automatically
complies if someone from OWASP Global ask, but I think it's fair enough
since we are not generating content, just publishing others. Also, I
don't plan to share any access to twitter and blogger, maybe someday we
could automate something but we are not there yet.

Thanks,

--
