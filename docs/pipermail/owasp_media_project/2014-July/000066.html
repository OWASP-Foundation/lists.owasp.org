<PRE>Hi Ian,

thanks for your comments it's greatly appreciated.

I haven't have the time to do a &quot;report&quot; on what we did at last AppSecEU
but we had pretty good camera hardware (Panasonic AGHMC41; Panasonic
AGHMC151).

If you want to backtrack what we've done there's some email post in the
archive for this, notably:
<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp_media_project/2013-December/000033.html">http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp_media_project/2013-December/000033.html</A>
<A HREF="http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp_media_project/2014-May/000051.html">http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp_media_project/2014-May/000051.html</A>

That said, I'm agreeing with you on the quality parts, but we have
limitations we should consider (and you named some):
- Every setup for every conference will be different as we change venue
each year in OWASP (in other conference they often stay at the same place)
- Quality of audio will ALWAYS depend on the room and local staff except
if we have a dedicated wireless mic for streaming and that can be more
problematic
- Everyone will have their view on what a stream should be.
- Costs and budget. We will never have a big budget for streaming,
however we can have a decent one.

For the capture part, I'm fairly sure that &quot;tapping&quot; the video stream is
one good option. We have bought 3 X-CAPTURE-1
<A HREF="http://solarisjapan.com/products/xcapture-1-usb-3-0-hd-capture-unit">http://solarisjapan.com/products/xcapture-1-usb-3-0-hd-capture-unit</A> to
stream the cameras at AppSecEU and it worked fine. Only limitation is
that it is Windows (DirectX) compatible only but they capture the
greatest range of outputs on earth for that price (around 350$USD).

The only problem I have with this is the position of the laptop that is
connected to the capture card. At AppSecEU, the filming was done from
the back of the room.

I'm really a prototype trying kind of guy and you can see the different
output we got:

direct capture of the screen with google hangout + Zoom H1
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG80aEXBZV9lk5nkEf3q-jaz">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG80aEXBZV9lk5nkEf3q-jaz</A>

proprietary software with provided laptops and post audio mixing from
room pro audio (worked pretty badly as we missed many talks)
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG8ODR2zWs06JkMmlRiLyBXU">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG8ODR2zWs06JkMmlRiLyBXU</A>

open broadcaster software + x-capture-1 hd input + panasonic pro camera
+ xlr input from room pro audio
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG_KHsxepT9o6trkqDELhr3">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG_KHsxepT9o6trkqDELhr3</A>_

At the point we are now, I think the solution is to use the X-CAPTURE-1
to have a &quot;tap&quot; on VGA and RCA audio from the room audio. Then, we use a
webcam for the presenter.

The reason I'm going towards that is that it is the most cost efficient
setup and we don't need the presenter face in HD. People are here for
the slides and demo outputs. I also want a setup that works for live
event or recording. So doing offline post is out of option. The webcam
is just because it will serve as a capture device over the X-CAPTURE-1.

I'll be beta testing this in OWASP Montreal's talks (often in French):
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/user/owaspmontreal/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/owaspmontreal/videos</A>


If you are motivated to contribute I think we could use someone like you
who seems to have experience with all this and most importantly wants to
have great content online.

Our roadmap is here
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Road_Map_and_Getting_Involved">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Road_Map_and_Getting_Involved</A>
but I think that with time we will actually shape the way streaming is
made within all OWASP. In my opinion OWASP is not a big corporation and
neither just a local conference, so we could be one of the great source
of free video content regarding appsec on the net (I think we already
are, but could be better).

The next big thing is AppSecUSA in Denver, but they will manage
themselves their own recording and streaming options. I'll be
&quot;consulting&quot; them to make sure it is as best as we could but I just plan
managing the upload of content on YouTube after the conference (will be
easier that way). I'll try to make contents from the Project Summit but
this will be way easier as I will just use a hangout setup.

By the way, consider yourself &quot;in&quot; the OWASP Media Project already. If
we need someone in Denver I'll contact you since you are somewhat close.

Thanks for jumping in,

- Jonathan

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     we will gladly accept any help!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Can you be specific on how you could help with video capture and
</I>&gt;<i>     presentation material. Also, can you describe what you think of current
</I>&gt;<i>     contents, and that will all conference content not just the latest one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well.  With zero additional resources or budget than just myself showing
</I>&gt;<i> up, I'd approach things in this way:
</I>&gt;<i> - Use my Canon 7D to capture HD video of the presenter
</I>&gt;<i> - Usually capture of presentation materials is super bad.  I find that
</I>&gt;<i> decks are better captured in post-production and the recorded content
</I>&gt;<i> integrated into the video easily.
</I>&gt;<i> - Capture of audio for the web can use any format or input
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Note that each conference as it's own way of capturing content and we
</I>&gt;<i>     are starting to get geared for more options globally.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes this is absolutely the way it has been done previously and generally
</I>&gt;<i> everyone creates a very poor work product that our peers and
</I>&gt;<i> constituents won't enjoy viewing, so they don't.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Streams are always clearly an afterthought because everyone should have
</I>&gt;<i> unlimited time and resources to attend the 500 cons that happen a year.
</I>&gt;<i>  The content that the CCC people make is pretty good, posted quickly and
</I>&gt;<i> for free in HD, and has been for years.  Everyone else does an amazingly
</I>&gt;<i> poor job considering we're all supposed to be world class technocrats
</I>&gt;<i> and some cons even employ professional production companies who do bad
</I>&gt;<i> work.  Why is the work product so bad under these circumstances?  I wish
</I>&gt;<i> I knew.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Non-perfect examples: <A HREF="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2013/">http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2013/</A>  Keep in
</I>&gt;<i> mind that most of these were produced in real time from the stream
</I>&gt;<i> content with minimal post-production effort, I suspect.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My take on the subject is that if it's worth the time and effort for
</I>&gt;<i> people to come and present at the conferences that we put together, we
</I>&gt;<i> might as well put forth the small effort of creating worthwhile content
</I>&gt;<i> for people who are unable to attend or want to share the content
</I>&gt;<i> provided to enrich others.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not saying that we can go straight to flawless streaming (as that's
</I>&gt;<i> pretty hard and things happen), but having some polished work afterward
</I>&gt;<i> at some point would be a lot better than present and easily achievable.
</I>&gt;<i>  DSLR rentals (should our volunteer resources fall short) are also quite
</I>&gt;<i> cheap, ubiquitous, and just about everything can capture 1080p nowadays.
</I>&gt;<i>  Plug a laptop into the sound board output (for normal speaking venues)
</I>&gt;<i> or straight into the mic, and you have speaker video and good-enough audio.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a demo?  Add HD capture from the device.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Combine with a deck playthrough with the speaker in a window and a
</I>&gt;<i> couple of title panes.  Throw some names under panelists.  Suddenly it's
</I>&gt;<i> better than just about anyone has done before outside of Deutschland.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's all super easy now.  I learned this stuff for the first time when
</I>&gt;<i> it was hard and required specialty equipment.  Now most of the process
</I>&gt;<i> is free and the software is grandma-accessible.  I don't see any excuses
</I>&gt;<i> for not doing it.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     And last, from which geographical region are you?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm in Seattle presently.  Happy to go wherever though I usually don't
</I>&gt;<i> attend many cons anymore because they tend to be a waste of time unless
</I>&gt;<i> you're a salesman or are speaking.  I've heard many peers echo this
</I>&gt;<i> lately.  It's a bad trend and we should find a better way to foster
</I>&gt;<i> discussion with our educational institutions crumbling or teaching
</I>&gt;<i> bad/old/weak content.  Who else will step up if not groups like OWASP?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     We currently have a team in Europe and we are looking for people in
</I>&gt;<i>     the USA.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're in luck!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i>
