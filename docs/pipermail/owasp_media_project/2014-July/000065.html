</I>&gt;<i> Can you be specific on how you could help with video capture and

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well.  With zero additional resources or budget than just myself showing
up, I'd approach things in this way:
- Use my Canon 7D to capture HD video of the presenter
- Usually capture of presentation materials is super bad.  I find that
decks are better captured in post-production and the recorded content
integrated into the video easily.
- Capture of audio for the web can use any format or input


&gt;<i> Note that each conference as it's own way of capturing content and we
</I>&gt;<i> are starting to get geared for more options globally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes this is absolutely the way it has been done previously and generally
everyone creates a very poor work product that our peers and constituents
won't enjoy viewing, so they don't.

Streams are always clearly an afterthought because everyone should have
unlimited time and resources to attend the 500 cons that happen a year.
 The content that the CCC people make is pretty good, posted quickly and
for free in HD, and has been for years.  Everyone else does an amazingly
poor job considering we're all supposed to be world class technocrats and
some cons even employ professional production companies who do bad work.
 Why is the work product so bad under these circumstances?  I wish I knew.

Non-perfect examples: <A HREF="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2013/">http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2013/</A>  Keep in
mind that most of these were produced in real time from the stream content
with minimal post-production effort, I suspect.

My take on the subject is that if it's worth the time and effort for people
to come and present at the conferences that we put together, we might as
well put forth the small effort of creating worthwhile content for people
who are unable to attend or want to share the content provided to enrich
others.

I'm not saying that we can go straight to flawless streaming (as that's
pretty hard and things happen), but having some polished work afterward at
some point would be a lot better than present and easily achievable.  DSLR
rentals (should our volunteer resources fall short) are also quite cheap,
ubiquitous, and just about everything can capture 1080p nowadays.  Plug a
laptop into the sound board output (for normal speaking venues) or straight
into the mic, and you have speaker video and good-enough audio.

Is there a demo?  Add HD capture from the device.

Combine with a deck playthrough with the speaker in a window and a couple
of title panes.  Throw some names under panelists.  Suddenly it's better
than just about anyone has done before outside of Deutschland.

It's all super easy now.  I learned this stuff for the first time when it
was hard and required specialty equipment.  Now most of the process is free
and the software is grandma-accessible.  I don't see any excuses for not
doing it.


&gt;<i> And last, from which geographical region are you?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm in Seattle presently.  Happy to go wherever though I usually don't
attend many cons anymore because they tend to be a waste of time unless
you're a salesman or are speaking.  I've heard many peers echo this lately.
 It's a bad trend and we should find a better way to foster discussion with
our educational institutions crumbling or teaching bad/old/weak content.
 Who else will step up if not groups like OWASP?


&gt;<i> We currently have a team in Europe and we are looking for people in the
</I>&gt;<i> USA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You're in luck!

Best,
