Hi Neil,

I hope everything went well with the YouTube channel and your contribution.

I suppose you are finished with work related to appsec cali 2014.

I think you hard linked the tags on the front page of appsec cali, but
you should really link the playlist since it's the only perma link:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG9lbJhvAOJrUaGXpZns7O0g

You were the first conference that independently used OWASP Media
Project and I want to know if there's any comments on your parts, and
what we can do better.

On my side, I have noted some things that I'll document and try to
explain to future managers/conferences:
- If you need them, you should have agreement before recording and not
after the conference in order to be quick about releasing videos.
- Promotion of the videos should be as important as uploading them. I
saw your view count where a little low for the quality of your
recordings. I'll try to map YouTube with @owasp twitter account for
automated publication but for now we need to do some things manually.
Maybe have project contributor help in real time for that.
- Link to playlist and embedding examples

BTW there's one thing still left to do: meta datatagging of videos in
order to link to appseccali website. This will help with SEO and traffic
towards your website in long term.

Thanks again for your contribution and get in touch with us for your
2015 edition!

Hi Neil,

thanks for your feedback! We will use that experience to help other
conferences in the future.

For the thing that wasn't clear, just make sure that
https://appseccalifornia.org/ points to
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG9lbJhvAOJrUaGXpZns7O0g
for the "View Screenscasts From the Event" button. Right now it's kind
of bugged due to usage of a temporary URL.

Thanks,
