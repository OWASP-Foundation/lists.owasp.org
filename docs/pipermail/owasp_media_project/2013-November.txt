Hi everyone,

I would like to welcome Nirmal Lama Titung from London in the OWASP
Media Project.

Nirmal actually has some experience with YouTube channel management, as
well as some video editing, and is motivated to get involved with OWASP.

I spoke with him for one hour in a Google Hangout and got him up to
speed with OWASP Media Project and OWASP Global Chapter Meetings.

I also gave him access to the YouTube channel and we are in the process
of getting him a @owasp.org email.

Since the next planned Global Meetings will be in London, he will check
with London chapter what's going on. He can already run the Hangout
himself if needed.

The next task that we are going to do is to parse AppSecEU2013 videos,
enhance and upload them with meta information. Nirmal is also taking
care of that and I'll oversee the stuff.

So welcome aboard Nirmal and thank you very for your help!

- Jonathan

Hello leaders,

at AppSecUSA Next week, I'll be conducting interviews and getting other
recordings in order to add content to OWASP Media Project
(http://www.youtube.com/OWASPGLOBAL).

I've been warned that network bandwidth might be an issue at the hotel,
so I'm wondering if someone can help me with that around the hotel
(let's say you have an office nearby or something). I'll need it all
around the week and especially Tuesday.

If you want to know more about Media Project and how to participate,
meet me on Monday morning: http://sched.co/GG2eih

I'm also welcoming any help I can get on the spot by helping me with
recordings or by giving me content.

Thanks,

--

Sarah, yes.

Josh, yes.

Tom, yes.

All, thanks for your support :-)

Everything you guys mentioned is planned and you can see it here :
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Roadmap

For the next 2 weeks the emphasis will be on appsecusa and after that we
will continue our "Internet leech" but we will promote other contents and
publish only what is not easily indexable and viewable instead of duplicate
everything we can find.

My goal for appsecusa is to have the talks and interviews online by the end
of the day. If people could just look around and help me getting content on
the spot it would be much appreciated.

Thanks again,

- Jonathan

Jonathan,

We've got videos from almost every OWASP Austin chapter meeting from the
past 3 years and each of our LASCON conferences if you'd like to include
them in your Media Project.

It's probably also worth mentioning that you can use my.owasp.org as a
place to link all of these videos together once they are uploaded.

Hi Sarah,

my plan with OWASP Media Project is to promote what I call "2013 best
practices". Having the videos 2 weeks is really not going well with that
since my objective is to have stuff online by a window of 12 hours.

It's not a big deal but I'll work in the long run so that we are more
agile with medias management. Everything really depends on what
technology Confex uses for recording.

BTW having only the slides and audio is only a minor concern. Content is
still valuable for online publication even if we don't see the speaker.

Still I'll gladly take the recording two weeks after and publish it onto
our official YouTube channel.

Thanks,

- Jonathan


PS: I'm looking for a lavalier mic with 1/8 jack, if by any chances you
have that nearby please send me an email.

Dear all,


Next week the Media Project Introduction will be happening at the
Project Summit in New York.


Details and agenda are available: http://sched.co/GG2eih.


Timing: Monday, November 19 9:00am - 10:00am


Location: Sky Lounge (16th Floor) (NY Marriott Marquis)


The OWASP Media Project is an infrastructure project that gathers,
consolidates, and promotes OWASP content in video format on a central
appealing hub. The first and main instance of the project will be a
YouTube channel.

The session will be used in order bring project leaders up to speed on
how video sharing and live streaming can help promote your project and
reach people. We will do that by presenting Google Hangout, and the
official OWASP YouTube channel.

Then, we will gather potential sources and existing videos in order to
populate the OWASP channel. This summit experience will not just be
about promoting the Media Project itself, but also about the exposure of
any other projects with video content.


If you plan to attend the Media Project session, add it to your
schedule: http://sched.co/GG2eih.

See you in New York!

Hi leaders,

if you want to see live stuff happening at AppSecUSA's Projects Summit in
NYC, just tune in to:
https://www.youtube.com/owaspglobal
and refresh from time to time. Stuff I can record will be immediately
available online and for viewing after.

It will also be on https://twitter.com/appsecusa so you can retweet it.

Thanks

- Jonathan

Hi Jerry,

as discussed I can give you access to the OWASP official YouTube channel
anytime now.
http://www.youtube.com/owaspglobal

The only thing I need is the email you use for your Google+ account. I
would suggest that you use your @owasp.org and create a Google+ account
based on that. If it's already registered to G+, tell me which it is
because now I can't find any.

Once this is solved, feel free to manage the playlist of
AppSecTutorialSeries and/or upload videos at your convenience:
http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG-13MFcAk-RxZkS2ty_oIKe

If you want to upload stuff, just put it into a playlist or ask us.

There's no need to re-upload content that has been uploaded elsewhere, but
future content would be good, especially now that we now that we can make a
playlist from many different channels.

I know it seems that you'll be pushing down previous efforts on your
channel, but in the long it will pay since many people are gonna join in
the official channel and promote it from everywhere.

You can also register to our mailing list (low volume) at
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp_media_project

If you need any help regarding playlists and cross-promotion stuff between
YouTube channels, do not hesitate to ask on the mailing list.

Thanks,

- Jonathan

Hi Kate,

if you want to add the AppSecUSA talks (they will be all there by
today/tomorrow) to the Connector here's the links:


https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG8ODR2zWs06JkMmlRiLyBXU

This is the playlist, all the recorded talks will be available on this page.


If you want a cleaner URL, people will be able to see AppSecUSA contents on:

https://www.youtube.com/owaspglobal

Note that this link will autoplay one video for non-subscriber.


Lastly, if you want to link directly to the whole playlist beginning
with the first talk :

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYFtLA2yTR8&list=PLpr-xdpM8wG8ODR2zWs06JkMmlRiLyBXU&index=1

and use the image provided as attachment in this email (you can resize
it if needed).

This link will also autoplay the first video.

Thanks,

Hi leaders,

I'm glad to announce that we have 43 online talks for 32 hours of
content from AppSecUSA 2013. Some have been available since the day
after the first day of the conference and we've been added them
gradually in the past week.


And now the links:

Playlist, all the recorded talks are available on this page:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG8ODR2zWs06JkMmlRiLyBXU
Short URL: http://sl.owasp.org/usa13_videos

YouTube, people will be able to see AppSecUSA featured contents on:
https://www.youtube.com/owaspglobal

Link directly to the whole playlist beginning with the first talk:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYFtLA2yTR8&list=PLpr-xdpM8wG8ODR2zWs06JkMmlRiLyBXU&index=1


If you want to help, go watch and "Like" the ones you prefer, share them
and subscribe to the channel.

Thanks,

Thanks Jonathan,

It is an amazing effort, and a real benefit to the community! Thank you 
for all the hard work to capture the spirit of OWASP in so much footage 
and make it available to a wider audience.

Cheers,

Dennis
