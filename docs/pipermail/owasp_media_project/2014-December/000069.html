<PRE>Hi Media Project List,

I'm a little late on the news telling, but we officially reached the
100,000 views on the YouTube channel on November 21st 2014.

The live streaming event of AppSecUSA 2014 in Denver helped us reach
that goal:

The project is going well as conferences now want to be part of it and
people involved know their way around it. On that, we also learned that
keynotes are what is worth filming and live casting as the rest of the
content is better recorded on computer feed and uploaded if you account
needed resources vs. online actual views. On the same note, we also
learned that doing that on a volunteering basis is saving the conference
a rather large mount of money.

OWASP Board is also involved as Michael do the OWASP Community Updates
on the channel and Jim did host a board meeting on it as well.

We also made the transition of OWASP Global Webinars to the main channel
but the staff changes of 2014 made us struggle with Webinars production.

Although the webinars are sparse a part of it is now in Spanish with
Fabio's OWASP en Espanol webinars that got a good traction on Google+:
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG_UuUG5GU9Nm-k7tRPbdry6">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG_UuUG5GU9Nm-k7tRPbdry6</A>

and the other part is Yvan's Global Meetings Project that haven't
rebooted yet, but I'll make OWASP Montreal just in in content for 2015:
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG92CUJZeqs7bsjZzDMwMnFB">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG92CUJZeqs7bsjZzDMwMnFB</A>

Resources-wise, we have students based in Denver and M&#252;nster (Germany)
who know their way around our solution. The German team is already in
contact for next AppSecEU and we'll plug who ever in Denver wants to go
to AppSecUSA as well.

We also have video capture cards (4 at Konik's, 1 in Montreal) available
for conferences, an investment that will cut down the cost of future
initiatives. I'm also using one in Montreal for recording the meetings,
and I can tell it's much more easier than using Google Hangout as you
don't need internet connection and a software on the speaker's laptop.

The OWASP Media Project will be kept as a platform with resources and
documentation to connect people for video content, but I'll be
distancing myself for on site work as we used to do with AppSecUSA/EU.
That doesn't mean we won't be involved, just that the people
participating in the effort will be managed by the conference and not
the leadership of Media Project (myself for now).

In conclusion, 2014 has been productive and thanks to everyone that has
contributed one way or another!
