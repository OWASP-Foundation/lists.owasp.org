PROGRAM WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING 2 PRESENTATIONS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEISAL NANJI (Ernst & Young) will speak on the Value of the SDLC within
Application Security

Understanding security vulnerabilities within the context of the SDLC
involves a variety of assessment techniques including threat models,
design reviews, security tests, and code reviews. Since enterprise
software development is a complicated undertaking, tools that help in
automating the discovery, analysis, reporting, and remediation of security
vulnerabilities are central to security process development and security
assessment. The presentation provides a description of processes and the
necessary tools to significantly improve security while applications are
being developed.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

PETER GIEN (Secure Software) will speak on Bringing Developers to the
Water and Making them Drink

Regulatory and legal forces are driving coding standards and practices in
large enterprises, particularly financial institutions. Some
financial institutions are meeting this challenge by developing Control
Standards that govern the development of critical software. In addition,
security has become an important activity through all phases of the SDLC.
Finally, compliance with Control Standards is now being forced by policy
driven, automated analysis of source code. Many institutions are adopting
frameworks for authentication, authorization and role-based access
control. In these cases, we are finding that significant levels of
vulnerability exist in the frameworks themselves, no matter if they are
internally developed or based on Open Source. In this talk we will give
examples of Control Standards that can be enforced through
automated analysis, as well as some examples that still have to be done
the old-fashioned way in a code review. We will also present a summary of
the automated analysis of some popular Open Source frameworks (Java and C)

Subject: [Owasp-new-york] [Owasp-world] Securing file upload
Message-ID: <08F4D210068DF34CB60F46AC80E0147614CBBA@crpex04.icicibankltd.com>

I am using a .NET application, in which there is a feature
to upload files (.doc .xls) onto the server. How do I ensure
that the end user is uploading only permitted file type(s) &
not files containing any malicious code which can lead to
the compromise of the server? Please suggest security
measures that should be taken to avoid any such unwanted
upload.
