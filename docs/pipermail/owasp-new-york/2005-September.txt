Hi Chapter Leads!

Below is a note from Dave Wichers about the OWASP AppSec Conference. 
Could you remind your chapters that the early-bird registration ends 
this Friday?

Also, as chapter leads, you're official members of OWASP and can 
register for the member price of $250.

--Jeff

-----------------------------

I just wanted to remind everyone that early registration for the OWASP
conference ends on Sept 9th (this Friday). On Sept 10. the registration 
fee
will increase by $50 for both Standard and Government registrants. Full
details on the conference are available at:
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005dc.html

Also, I have been informed by the staff at NIST that there will be NO 
ONSITE
REGISTRATION. Thus, you must register for the conference by Oct 10th via 
the
website. We then have to provide a list of registrants to the Guards at
NIST. You will be required to provide them with picture ID. If you are 
on
the registration list, they will then let you enter the facility to the
conference building where you can pick up your conference badge.

Also, the training class on Oct 10, the day before the conference, is 
almost
full so I encourage anyone interested in signing up to do so soon. If 
there
are enough registrants over the course max, we might open up a second
offering of the class at the same date and location. However, we need to
decide this soon so we can reserve the room. So please register for the
course as soon as possible if you are interested to ensure you get a 
spot.

Registration info from previous announcements repeated below:

REGISTRATION DETAILS: As a non-profit charitable organization, and with
NIST's sponsorship, OWASP has been able to keep the cost to $300 per 
seat if
you are able to register prior to Sept. 10, 2005. The cost to government
employees is only $250 prior to Sept. 10th.

Registration information is available at:
http://www.owasp.org/docroot/owasp/Registration/index.jsp

PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL TICKETS ARE NON REFUNDABLE TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATION
COSTS

FOUNDATIONS OF APPLICATION SECURITY COURSE - Oct 10: OWASP has arranged 
to
have a one-day hands on Web Application Security training course the day
prior to the conference. This one day class will be held at the nearby
Holiday Inn and is only $600 for conference attendees. Registration for 
this
course can be done via the conference registration page.

More details on this training course is available at:
http://www.owasp.org/conferences/appsec2005dc/training.html

EVENING SOCIAL EVENT - Oct 11: An optional dinner event is being held at 
the
Holiday Inn Gaithersburg, which is the same location where the training 
is
to be held on the 10th, and where discounted rooms are being made 
available
to all conference attendees (see Accommodations below).

This event involves a dinner at the hotel from 7-9 PM, followed by 
drinks at
O'Malley's Irish Pub right in the hotel or out by the hotel's indoor 
pool
adjacent to the pub. We hope to see all of you there as this is a great
chance to mingle and meet many members of the OWASP community.

Please contact me with any questions. Looking forward to seeing you all
there!

Thanks, Dave

PROGRAM WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING 2 PRESENTATIONS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEISAL NANJI (Ernst & Young) will speak on the Value of the SDLC within
Application Security

Understanding security vulnerabilities within the context of the SDLC
involves a variety of assessment techniques including threat models,
design reviews, security tests, and code reviews. Since enterprise
software development is a complicated undertaking, tools that help in
automating the discovery, analysis, reporting, and remediation of security
vulnerabilities are central to security process development and security
assessment. The presentation provides a description of processes and the
necessary tools to significantly improve security while applications are
being developed.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

PETER GIEN (Secure Software) will speak on Bringing Developers to the
Water and Making them Drink

Regulatory and legal forces are driving coding standards and practices in
large enterprises, particularly financial institutions. Some
financial institutions are meeting this challenge by developing Control
Standards that govern the development of critical software. In addition,
security has become an important activity through all phases of the SDLC.
Finally, compliance with Control Standards is now being forced by policy
driven, automated analysis of source code. Many institutions are adopting
frameworks for authentication, authorization and role-based access
control. In these cases, we are finding that significant levels of
vulnerability exist in the frameworks themselves, no matter if they are
internally developed or based on Open Source. In this talk we will give
examples of Control Standards that can be enforced through
automated analysis, as well as some examples that still have to be done
the old-fashioned way in a code review. We will also present a summary of
the automated analysis of some popular Open Source frameworks (Java and C)
