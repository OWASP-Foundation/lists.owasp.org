<PRE>Folks,
   Pegasystems, the industry leading Business Process Management software vendor, is seeking to hire someone into a unique role exclusively focused on application security architecture. Ideally, we would like this person to work at our Cambridge, MA headquarters, but we are willing to have someone unable to relocate to Boston to work remotely anywhere in the US.

   This will be a highly visible position in which you will design and develop  (no white board warriors who think coding is beneath  them) the security architecture inside our flagship product, an application platform that is still generating multi-million dollar deals within industries that are coping with historic financial losses. The ROI on our product is that strong, and it may make us one of the safest software companies at which to work given this climate.

   Our customers, which include some of the world's largest firms, use Pega Rules Process Commander to design and deploy BPM applications that automate their standard business processes through the deployment of a rules-driven web application. Your goal would be to make sure the platform addresses the many vulnerabilities to application security - cross-browser scripting, SQL Injection, session hijacking, etc. There is less emphasis on authentication and authorization, although those to facets have their place.

   Here is the complete job description, and sorry but we are not able to use agencies:

   We started a business unit focused entirely on BPM 6 years ago and ran it as a stand-alone business, branching out from our original product that handled payment exception handling. The BPM unit struggled to make $2M that year, but it was clear we could have a much wider impact. As we shaped our technology, the entire company focus shifted to BPM and rapidly became the industry leader. Our revenue target for 2012 is $1 Billion.

      PRPC has taken us from new entrant in an emerging field to the industry leader redefining how the world's largest firms run their enterprises. These articles will give you a better understanding of how we are perceived in the market place:
