  &quot;COMPUTER EVIDENCE, CONTROL AND PRIVACY&quot;.  
   
  ABSTRACT*: Corporations are increasing their monitoring activities to remain vigilant and stay ahead of potential risk and adversity.  However, as they monitor the premises and personnel what should a CSO / CISO be cognizant of and what are the legal guidelines and ramifications associated with these practices.

Prior to joining the firm, John served as Deputy General Counsel for National Security Affairs at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  In that role, he provided counsel to the FBI Director and other senior FBI executives regarding its counterterrorism, counterintelligence and counterespionage missions, especially concerning sophisticated electronic surveillance matters.  He also represented the FBI in dealings with the Department of Justice, the Intelligence Community and Congressional staff.  For more than 12 years, John served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York; most recently, as a National Security Coordinator and Senior Litigation Counsel.

  &quot;GETTING TOUGH ON SECURITY BREACHES&quot;

  BIO*: Mr. Behnam Dayanim possesses extensive experience in advising the financial services industry with respect to issues relating to electronic commerce.
