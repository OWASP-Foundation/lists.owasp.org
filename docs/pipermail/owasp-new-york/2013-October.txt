Exploiting SQL Injection. From SQLi 101 to mind bending 2nd order
injection, file read/write access, remote code execution; we have got it
all covered. Whether you are a student who is just starting a career in
field of IT security or a professional who wants to become a Ninja, we have
something for everyone!


You can access a wide variety of challenges on-line and master the Art of
Exploiting SQL Injection. We currently have 20 challenges with 70 objects
covering 4 databases (MS-SQL, Oracle, Mysql and Postgres).
