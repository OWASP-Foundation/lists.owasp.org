     Luke Guerrero

(Discussion Details Below)

*WHEN: Wednesday, January 25, 2006 from 6PM - 9PM

*COCKTAILS: Following the presentation, we look forward to networking at

peter.stern at owasp.org


*Price Waterhouse Coopers Discussion:

Web Services are the new growth vehicle behind the Participation Age;
allowing organizations to share, combine, use, and reuse their computing
resources under the platform agnostic wrappings of the internet. We will
discuss case studies of the companies, present lessons learned, and
expound current security issues. The presentation will introduce web
services, and then advance into the detailed matters of security
implementation.

*Speakers:

Vilaiporn Taweelappontong is a Manager within the Security Practice of
PricewaterhouseCoopers New York.  She has extensive experience with
assessing, implementing, and penetration testing network security.   Over
the years she has led a number of security projects for organizations and
financial institutions in the US, Singapore, Thailand and Hong Kong.   She
is an experienced hands-on penetration tester and has performed  Numerous
black-box penetration tests for various organizations.  She has developed
information security frameworks, security standards, baseline security
requirements and technical standards for various organizations. Throughout
her career she performed security assessments for various organization
applications including the following systems:
deal-capturing, reconciliation, fund transfer, back-end processing, and
trade finance.

Sachin Rajpal has been with PricewaterhouseCoopers for over 5 years and 
is currently a Manager in the Identity Management practice. He has led 
large scale design and implementations of identity management solutions
for the past 3 years covering various aspects including Access Control,
Role
engineering, Web services security, User repositories and User
lifecycle management.

Sachin has a software development background, and has architected large
scale enterprise middleware and integration solutions. He has significant
experience in project management, design, deployment and software quality
assurance methodologies. Before joining PwC Sachin worked for Tata
Consultancy Services (TCS).

Luke Guerrero is an associate in the Identity Management practice at
PricewaterhouseCoopers. He has working experience in computer security,
Human Computer Interaction (HCI), and software and web development.


*Cenzic Discussion:

While there are a lot of solid guidelines for application security
including the ones from OWASP, implementation details for the types of
applications are not clearly articulated.  Most companies with a mammoth
task of securing hundreds of web applications have not made a significant
move toward securing these apps focused on web services.

Are web services important to secure?
Should companies be focusing on web services compared to other critical
issues relating to web applications?

This talk will explore the history of web service security, why it's
important, how to prioritize web services vis-a-vis other vulnerabilities,
and other issues relating to web services security.


*Speaker:

Tom Stracener is Cenzic's Senior Vulnerability Research Analyst. Tom  has
been a leading technologist in the security space for over 6 years. Tom
was the head of vulnerability research for nCircle and various  consulting
and open source projects. He invented the industry's first numeric
vulnerability scoring system and is the co-inventor of 6 network security
technologies with patents pending. He is the author of many security
related whitepapers and has spoken at various conferences on network and
application security topics. He is also responsible for the critical
application alerts that Cenzic's research lab, Cenzic Intelligent Analysis
(CIA), issues on a monthly basis.

Hi all,

Stan, Peter, thanks for having me down to speak on GoogleHacking for
Web Services.

I enjoyed meeting everyone. I have signed up for the list since I may
be coming back to NY from time to time, and if I have the opportunity,
I would like to attend a chapter meeting and spend some more time
hanging out.

I am going to finish up my modifications to Sensepost's Wikto to
perform the GH searches from the presentation, so if anybody wants a
copy of the schema.xml file, just let me know.

peace,

-Tom
