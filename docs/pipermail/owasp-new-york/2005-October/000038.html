<PRE>Here is an announcement from the Ironbound Business Association about a
disaster planning meeting open to all business people:

Dear Ironbound Business Association Member:

The tragedy of Hurricane Katrina has focused us all on the appropriate
response to natural and man-made disasters. The truth of the matter, as we
all know from 9/11, is that it can happen here. 

History shows us that when disaster strikes, employees properly ask, &quot;Do I
stay here, or do I take care of my family?&quot; 

Many businesses have disaster recovery plans in place, of course. And most
plans focus on computers, finances, and post-emergency public relations. The
common denominator often not considered is the person. By making contingency
plans to help your employees, not only are you doing the right thing -
you're protecting your business.

As many of you know, I am a Past President of the Ironbound Business
Association. We've arranged a special conference and networking event for
Thursday, October 6, 2005, at the Park Avenue Club in Florham Park from 6 to
8 PM. We'll be discussing proper emergency planning for businesses. The cost
is $75 per person, with half of all profits going to the American Red Cross
for Hurricane Katrina Relief.

The featured speaker will be Bill Vorlicek, Director of the Emergency
Management Group of Kroll, Inc. Bill is a retired colonel in the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, and is an expert on weapons of mass destruction,
chemical and biological terrorism, aviation emergencies, and severe weather
events. He planned, managed and supervised the New York National Guard's WMD
response for New York City and FEMA Region II. He is frequently quoted in
the American and international media. He has prepared innumerable disaster
response plans in the private and public sector, and has been intimately
involved in the response to many high-profile incidents, such as 9/11, TWA
Flight 800, and the 1996 New York City blizzard.

In short, we couldn't have a better speaker on this subject, and you can't
afford to miss what Bill has to say.

You can register online at <A HREF="http://www.ironboundbusiness.com,">http://www.ironboundbusiness.com,</A> or by sending
me a reply e-mail requesting a fax registration form. 

I look forward to seeing you on October 6 for this important conference.

Dear Colleague,



Prime View is putting together a few &quot;Hacking Defined&quot; events in late 
October and November this year. Prime View's Hacking Defined Summit and 
events provide delegates with the awareness, essential skills and 
guidelines to protect their systems from malicious intrusion attacks 
performed by hackers. Their URL is: <A HREF="http://www.hackingdefined.us/">http://www.hackingdefined.us/</A>



Additional information regarding the different events and syllabus are 
available upon request. We will be happy to answer any questions you may 
have. The phone number is for registration or questions is: 
212-947-7940. I can be reached either by email or phone provided at the 
end of this message.



I thought that the OWASP New York Metro Chapter would agree to promote 
them to the members.



We would like to offer OWASP members a 50% discount for any event.



Waiting for your reply.



Sincerely,

Alex Zacharov
