Subject: [Owasp-new-york] Learn about Security @ Square
Message-ID: <CACh9Yg_CaKdHa-BHPY2UFHYO3Juh4HK6iXctDLb04_+rE41Kwg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

On Jan 30th in NYC Square will be giving a talk on the security of their
distributed payments architecture.

In the talk, Square engineering lead Wiktor Macura will demonstrate methods
for building distributed secure systems, optimized for various permutations
of performance, reliability & security. You'll develop a better
appreciation for the CAP theorem, breaking the rules, and generally making
amazing and secure customer focused systems.

The talk will be held at eBay in Manhattan. Due to door security - you must
RSVP here to attend (there are limited spots available):

Cheers,
