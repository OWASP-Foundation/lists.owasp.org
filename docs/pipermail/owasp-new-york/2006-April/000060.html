  Come join us for another free information packed event and earn CISSP CPE credits.  Our chapter has grown to 200 members and let&#146;s all get together and participate in some great talks, network and make new friends. 
   
  Presentations:
1) Project Liberty &#150; Digital Identity Management and Identity-Based Web Services - Founded in the Fall of 2001, the Liberty Alliance remains the only Global organization dedicated to the creation of open technical and business standards for digital identity management and identity-based web services. Andrew's presentation will include an overview of Liberty's past and future output, with a focus on real-world examples of how organizations have used Liberty's specifications to address a variety of business and technical challenges.  Discussion points will include:
    
   Introduction to / update on Liberty Alliance  
   Deployment case studies &amp; anecdotes  
   Business &amp; legal implications of federated identity  
   Emerging and future work areas for Liberty
  Speaker: Andrew Shikiar, Membership Director, Liberty Alliance Project
   
  2) Finding Gold in the Browser Cache - With client side web browsers under constant attack, what can web application programmers do to help prevent sensitive data from being stored in a user's cache? This presentation includes an overview of the benefits and dangers of web browser caching. It then digs deeper - exploring how attackers can extract that data and how web application developers can prevent sensitive information from being cached in the first place. This presentation builds on numerous real world application tests and data retrievals. Examples will demonstrate the wealth of information that can be found in both Firefox and Internet Explorer.
