The number of reported security incidents has always been proportional to
the number of vendor-issued vulnerabilities. However, recently this trend
seems to have broken. This can be attributed to an increase in attacks
against custom applications, attacks targeting end-users, zero-day
exploits, and self-propagating worms. This presentation will discuss such
trend-breaking real world attacks.

Rohyt Belani is a Director with Red Cliff Consulting. His expertise
encompasses the areas of wireless security, application security and
incident response. Rohyt is also an experienced and talented instructor of
technical security education courses. Rohyt is a frequent author of
