Message-ID: <20040521015359.18360.qmail@web11802.mail.yahoo.com>


Hello Everyone,

 

I guess we should open this up for discussion.  Since this is a new chapter we can be imaginative like an artist with a blank canvas.  Any creative mission statements?

 

Feel free to volunteer in helping create the www.owasp.org/nyc website.

 

We are currently working on the chapter By Laws so we can all operate under the same guidelines.  If anyone wants to help create the By Laws please let me know.

 

Thanks,
Stan

Stan, 

Do you have a website or page off OWASP for the NYC chapter? I want to start inviting some people, and point them to a web site with some information about our mission.

Who manages the OWASP.org web page? I'd like to see us have a page on http://www.owasp.org/nyc

Subject: [Owasp-new-york] FASD project: Online survey launched
Message-ID: <17704464.1085472265732.JavaMail.luthiger@cms02>

Dear Open Source developer

I am doing a research project on "Fun and Software Development" in which I kindly invite you to participate.
You will find the online survey under http://fasd.ethz.ch/qsf/. The questionnaire consists of 53 questions and you will need about 15 minutes to complete it.

With the FASD project (Fun and Software Development) we want to define the motivational significance of fun when software developers decide to engage in Open Source projects. What is special about our research project is that a similar survey is planned with software developers in commercial firms. This procedure allows the immediate comparison between the involved individuals and the conditions of production of these two development models. Thus we hope to obtain substantial new insights to the phenomenon of Open Source Development.


With many thanks for your participation,
Benno Luthiger


PS:
The results of the survey will be published under http://www.isu.unizh.ch/fuehrung/blprojects/FASD/.
We have set up the mailing list fasd at webboard.ethz.ch for this study. Please see http://fasd.ethz.ch/qsf/mailinglist_en.html for registration to this mailing list.
