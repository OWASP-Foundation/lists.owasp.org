Subject: [Owasp-new-york] April NYC Meeting Topics
Message-ID: <20060224134827.35944.qmail@web37312.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello All,
   
  I was suggested that we have a presentation on Project Liberty at our April chapter meeting.  This seems like a very interesting topic.  Anyone familiar with the topic and willing to present?
   
  Thanks,
Stan
