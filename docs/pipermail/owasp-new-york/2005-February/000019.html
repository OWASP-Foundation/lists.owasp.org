<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>My company is also looking to hire someone. IT application auditor,
description is below, I'm happy to submit and/or answer any questions.
Position is primarily in Stamford CT, but (and I make no promises here) the
right person may be able to talk their way into being in the city most of
the time.

Position Description:  	There are separate teams responsible for auditing
the activities of each of the main operating Divisions, an IT Audit group,
which is responsible for IT applications and infrastructure audits across
all the Bank's divisions; in addition, we have the Corporate Centre audit
groups of the Chief Risk Auditor and the Chief Financial Auditor. The heads
of each of these Divisional and functional teams report to the Head of GIA
who, in turn, reports directly to the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

The approach to audit work is risk oriented, and resources are allocated to
cover the key risks in the business and IT areas. The department has
established standard procedures for audit techniques and documentation of
work papers, and the audit process is highly automated. The work of GIA is
actively supported by management, and the independent assessment of the
quality of internal control is viewed as an important contributory function
to the quality of management services. We seek to add value to the quality
of these controls by making constructive recommendations with cost effective
solutions.

The Senior IT Application Auditor role is a very interesting and challenging
role. The role is based within the IT Application Audit team, which is
primarily responsible for providing IT Audit support for business audits and
global pre-implementation reviews. The role will be within the Investment
Banking team and therefore the candidate will potentially get good exposure
to all systems and processes, within all sections of Investment Banking
(Front to Back) as well as covering all product areas, including Equities,
Fixed Income, Rates, Currencies, Derivatives, etc.

The role provides a great opportunity for the candidate to get a good
understanding of the bank and should provide an excellent base for a long
and successful career within the Bank, either within GIA or the wider
business. All IT auditors are encouraged to develop their technical and
personal skills through on the job training, and the attendance of both
internal and external training courses. The role currently involves between
10-15% travel, and this is not expected to increase in the foreseeable
future. However, for candidates who wish to travel there is opportunity for
more travel.
  	 
# Minimum Job Requirements: 	Qualifications: Degree educated and
professionally qualified (ACA, CISA, QICA, CISSP etc) or MSc in IT security

Experience:
# Due to the nature of the role, the candidate needs a good overall
understanding of risk management and control, in relation to IT and the
business
# The candidate should be an experienced professional (at least 5 years) who
has carried out business / operational audits and IT audits
# Although the IT Application Audit team mainly reviews application level
controls, the candidate must have a reasonable understanding of IT security
risks at all levels, including operating systems, database systems,
middleware, web etc
# The candidate should have experience/understanding of Investment Banking,
including a reasonable knowledge of financial products, including Swaps,
Options, Bonds, FX, Equities, etc

Communication skills:
# Has the ability to communicate clearly and effectively at all levels up to
senior management
# Be able to write clearly and concisely
# Be able to establish effective business relationships and influence others
# Conduct interviews and/or meetings and make presentations at all levels

Analytical skills:
# Must posses excellent analytical skills to assess the effectiveness of
internal controls over key IT risks, identify significant exposures, analyze
transactions and other management information and detect changes in key
risks and/or control effectiveness

Behavioral:
# Takes initiative and acts independently with minimal direction
# Is enthusiastic and self-motivated
# Is a team player that sets individual goals and objectives that are
consistent with those of the group
# Is customer focused and acts with integrity and honesty
