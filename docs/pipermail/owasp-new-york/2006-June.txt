Hi All,

 

The OWASP Java Project
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Java_Project) needs
volunteers!

 


The goal of this project is to develop materials to enable Java and J2EE
developers to develop secure software.

 

We have created a roadmap for the project
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Project_Roadmap 

If any of these areas interests you please email me and I can add your
name as a volunteer to that section.

 

We have also setup a mailing list for the project. You can subscribe by
visiting:

 

http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/java-project 

 

The success of this project is dependant on participation by folks like
you.

 

I look forward to your involvement.

 

Thanks,

Rohyt
