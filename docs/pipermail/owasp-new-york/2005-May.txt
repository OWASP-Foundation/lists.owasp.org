designed and built the then-fastest fully programmable digital signal

video wall industry, leading the development of a 12 foot by 60 foot
wall for the Nasdaq Stock Market as physical incarnation of the virtual
stock market. 

Shifted gears from tech development to product and strategic planning.
Became Product Planning Manager for Quality Systems and Software, later
acquired by Telelogic. Managed definition and development of a product
and technology roadmapping tool as part of a joint development with
Motorola. Moved to Agilent Technologies as Platform Business Manager for
the Power Supply "product generation unit". 

Currently Co-Founder of AlphaPointTechnology, providing innovative
products and services for Inventory and Asset Management to hi-tech
industries.
