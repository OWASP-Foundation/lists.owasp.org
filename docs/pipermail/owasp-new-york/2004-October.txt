Hello everyone -

My company is hiring and I thought some of you might be interested.  It's in 
Jersey City, but it's right outside the PATH so it's a shorter commute than 
some jobs in the city.  We are looking for an experienced app pen tester, or 
someone with strong knowledge of applications and security independently.

Here is the monster link:

See you at the chapter meeting - Sam

Hello Everyone,

Thank you for attending the chapter meeting yesterday.  It was a smashing success!  We had very good discussions on incorporation security into the SDLC and security code review mythologies.

 

I?ll be working with Thomas Ryan, our new webmaster, to get the PPT sides up on the NYC chapter website http://www.owasp.org/local/nyc.html.  It looks like our next meeting will be in January.  I?ll let Peter Stern, our new meeting organizer, work out the details.

 

BTW, our meetings qualify for CPE credit for CISSPs.

 

Thank you,
Stan Guzik
