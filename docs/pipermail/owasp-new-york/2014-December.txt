Hi and Happy Holidays to all,

The ICCS is coming up January 8 at Fordham University, Lincoln Center
campus. http://iccs.fordham.edu/

We are seeking volunteers to man the OWASP table at the event. ICCS will
give us up to two sponsor passes. If you are already registered and can
spare some time please let me know. We need to be sure to cover the table
for the entire conference, so relief coverage from folks who are already
registered will be helpful.
