Subject: [Owasp-new-york] Future NYC Local Chapter OWASP Meetings
Message-ID: <20041101155350.86914.qmail@web20924.mail.yahoo.com>

Following up on the well attended first OWASP NYC Local Chapter meeting (October 20th), we are in the process of planning the follow-up.
 
For those planning your 2005 calendar already; the targeted date for the next meeting is Tuesday, January 25th at 6PM.  Thanks to the generosity of Time Inc., this meeting will be hosted at the Time Inc Building (1271 6th Avenue; between 50th & 51st Streets).
 
Please watch the NYC OWASP for the offical meeting announcement and details.

Thinking beyond the second meeting, we are looking for future topics of interest and speakers.  We would like our meetings to reflect the interests of our chapter participants.  
 
Therefore, please feel free to email to me topics of interest and if you might like to volunteer to be a presenter.  
 
Thanks for your participation.
 
Peter

Subject: [Owasp-new-york] Sr. Web Developer
Message-ID: <20041116202903.90012.qmail@web11802.mail.yahoo.com>


Hello Everyone,

 

If you know anyone who is a Sr. Web Developer looking for work in Bergen County NJ please let me know.  Expertise in Microsoft technology is a must (ASP, VB, T-SQL, .NET, and etc).  Secure programming is not a requirement.  I will train in security.

 

BTW, out next chapter meeting will be in January.  We?ll send out the details shortly.

 

Thanks, 
Stan Guzik

Hello Everyone,

 

I just received a call from an old friend that works for IDB Bank.  They are a medium sized NYC bank.  They are looking for an Information Security Officer.  I?m sending this email to the list because I personally know the IT staff at the bank and they are a GREAT group of people to work with.  If you or someone you know is looking for an Information Security Officer position in NYC, at a great place to work, please contact Andrew Landi at alandi at idbny.com.

 

On a separate note, our next OWASP NYC chapter meeting is January 25, 2005.  The meeting details will be sent out soon.

 

BTW, on 12/1 I?m speaking at the ISACA NYC Chapter meeting so I may see some of you this Wednesday.

 
Thanks,
Stan
