<PRE>NYU-Poly's Information Systems and Internet Security (ISIS) Laboratory

is hosting a worldwide phenomenon, Cyber Security Awareness Week

(<A HREF="https://csaw.isis.poly.edu/">https://csaw.isis.poly.edu/</A>), that we would like you all to be a part

of. This year we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of the

competition, which has since grown to include technical aspects as

well as student opportunities. We would like to take this time to

highlight some of different events going on throughout the weekend.



This year, some world-renowned names have joined CSAW as sponsors.

Currently, Facebook, Google, Blackberry, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, and

the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are some of the few sponsors

of CSAW 2013. To view the complete list of sponsors or sponsorship

opportunities, visit: <A HREF="https://csaw.isis.poly.edu/sponsorship/.">https://csaw.isis.poly.edu/sponsorship/.</A>



CSAW 2013 includes the finals of six competitions that bring together

some of the most brilliant high school, undergraduate, and graduate

students, and experts in security. Students from all over the world

will be flown to New York to compete from November 14th through

November 16th. Come and watch our finalists in the Capture the Flag

(CTF), High School Forensics (HSF) and Embedded Systems Challenge

(ESC) competitions solve security related challenges. Also, it is not

too late to register for the DHS Quiz competition and the Security

Awareness competition! Cash prizes are awarded to the top three

participants in both of these competitions. For more information on

either competition visit <A HREF="https://quiz.isis.poly.edu/">https://quiz.isis.poly.edu/</A> and

<A HREF="https://awareness.isis.poly.edu/">https://awareness.isis.poly.edu/</A> respectively.



One of the biggest opportunities that we offer to students is the CSAW

Cyber-Security Career Fair. The career fair is open to anyone

attending CSAW (competitors, conference attendees, other students and

registered CSAW attendees). These students will be able to meet with

recruiters from government agencies and corporations of CSAW sponsors.

Resumes of students registered for the career fair will be provided to

recruiters in advance, and must include at least two security related

courses to be accepted. The CSAW Cyber-Security Career Fair takes

place on Friday, November 15th, from 10 AM through 3 PM. For more

information, visit <A HREF="https://csaw.isis.poly.edu/career_fair.">https://csaw.isis.poly.edu/career_fair.</A>



CSAW 2013's THREADS Conference focuses on DARPA's revolutionary Cyber

Fast Track program. This is an awesome opportunity to hear from our

speakers about the latest in security research. The THREADS Conference

takes place on November 14th from 9 AM to 6 PM at NYU-Poly. For more

information about THREADS and the speakers, visit

<A HREF="http://threads.isis.poly.edu/.">http://threads.isis.poly.edu/.</A> THREADS is free for NYU students and

for more registration information visit

<A HREF="https://csawthreads.eventbrite.com/.">https://csawthreads.eventbrite.com/.</A>



We would love for you to take advantage of this opportunity and become

a part of CSAW 2013. To register as a spectator, visit

And remember, our sponsors are here for recruiting purposes and networking,
so make sure to attend!
