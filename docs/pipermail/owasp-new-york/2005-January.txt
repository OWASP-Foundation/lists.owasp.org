fyi - I though some of you many be interested.

Dear Colleague,

OWASP is proud to announce its second Application Security Conference to be
held April 9-10 near London. The OWASP AppSec Europe 2005 Conference is just
a short 3 months away and since there's limited seating, be sure to register
early to reserve your seat and support the not-for-profit OWASP Foundation.
Check out the OWASP website at http://www.owasp.org/conferences.html for all
the emerging details.

You'll hear great speakers like:

- Denis Verdon (Head of CISG, Fidelity National Financial)
- Dr. Charles Pfleeger (Author of Security in Computing)
- Jeff Williams (OWASP Chair and CEO, Aspect Security)
- Dinis Cruz (Leader of the OWASP .NET project)
- Rogan Dawes (Author of WebScarab)
- Ivan Ristic (Author of ModSecurity)
- David Raphael (Java and .NET Security)
- Arian Evans (Session Management and Testing Tools)

AppSec Europe 2005 is April 9-10 at Royal Holloway, University of London --
home of one of the best InfoSec programs in Europe and featured in the Da
Vinci Code. OWASP's AppSec conferences are dedicated to real-world
application security issues and solutions. You'll learn all aspects of
application security, including people, process, and technology
perspectives.

You'll hear presentations on topics like:

- OWASP Status, Direction, and new Projects
- Web Application Testing Tools and Techniques
- Code Reviews
- Application Security in Large Organizations
- .NET, Java, and LAMP Security
- Web Application Intrusion Detection
- Software Security Metrics
- Lessons Learned in the Trenches

There will also be panel discussions on the important issues led by
corporate application security practitioners. We will post a full agenda as
soon as it is finalized. By participating you'll have a direct opportunity
to help shape and influence the direction of OWASP in 2005.

REGISTRATION DETAILS: As a not-for-profit we have been able to keep the cost
to ?150 (or $280) per seat which is significantly less than what most
conferences cost.

You can register for the conference using PayPal (preferred) using the
following email address conference-nyc at owasp.org. We also have a direct
link to Paypal via the OWASP Website at www.owasp.org. Alternatively, you
can register by sending a check in USD made payable to the OWASP Foundation:
