Here is a description of the planned meeting:

The meeting will be hosted at:
Ernst &amp; Young
5 Times Square
between 42th &amp; 7th Ave
22end Floor

Agenda For The Evening
6:00PM &#150; 6:30PM Check-In/Social
6:30PM &#150; 6:45PM Chapter Details (couple of security books will be given
away) &#150; Stan Guzik
6:45PM &#150; 7:45PM Presentation (Trend-Breaking Real World Attacks) - Rohyt
Belani
7:45PM &#150; 8:00PM Meeting Wrap-up

Presentation Topic:
The number of reported security incidents has always been proportional to
the number of vendor-issued vulnerabilities. However, recently this trend
seems to have broken. This can be attributed to an increase in attacks
against custom applications, attacks targeting end-users, zero-day
exploits, and self-propagating worms. This presentation will discuss such
trend-breaking real world attacks.

Presenter Profile:
Rohyt Belani is a Director with Red Cliff Consulting. His expertise
encompasses the areas of wireless security, application security and
incident response. Rohyt is also an experienced and talented instructor of
technical security education courses. Rohyt is a frequent author of
articles for SecurityFocus, a reputed information security portal.

He is also a contributing author for the Osborne publication, Hack Notes &#150;
Network Security and the Addison-Wesley publication, Extrusion Detection:
Security Monitoring for Internal Intrusions. Additionally, he is a regular
speaker at various industry conferences and forums like HTCIA, FBI-Cyber
Security Summit, HP World, and the New York State Cyber Security
Conference.
