Subject: [Owasp-new-york] THE Web App Penetration Tester Opportunity
Message-ID: <3298D68A5BD60245B552AFA41B3077BA1AC89B7B@WarpDrive.gotech.local>

My name is Michael Aguilar and I am an IT recruiter for GTN Technical Staffing here in Dallas, Texas. My job and passion is finding top tier IT professionals and offering them the best career opportunities that fit their skill set, love of technology, and personal lives.

I have a client in Irving, Texas that is looking for top end Penetration Testers that focus on Web Application Security. I am looking for professionals that LOVE Web App Penetration Testing and want to work in a fast pace, team environment where there is room for both vertical and horizontal growth. This is a financial company professional's fight to get into. They are willing to pay for relocation, offer a great bonus structure based on your performance with no cap, and the benefits are top of the line.

Even if you aren't actively searching for a new role, this is not an opportunity to miss out on. This is a chance to upgrade your professional career. Let's talk. I will make myself available to give you the info you need to make the best decision possible.


Thanks and looking forward to getting you to the next level,


Michael Aguilar
