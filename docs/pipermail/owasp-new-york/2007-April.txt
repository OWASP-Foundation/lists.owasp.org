DETAILED AGENDA

--------------------- 

 

6:00pm - 7:00pm Speaker: Marc Maiffret, Founder/CTO & Chief Hacking Officer eEye Digital Security As eEye Digital Security's Co-Founder/CTO and Chief Hacking Officer, Marc Maiffret has been a driving force in the vision and continuous innovation for eEye's product development and vulnerability research efforts since the company's inception in 1998. Long regarded as a security expert and thought leader in vulnerability assessment and endpoint security, Marc Maiffret also leads the efforts of eEye's world renowned Research Team. In addition, Mr. Maiffret speaks regularly on the state of security across the globe, including several appearances before Congress, where he has testified on information policies and security threats posed to both public and private infrastructures. Mr. Maiffret's role in vulnerability research, education and product innovation has been reflected in the numerous awards and distinguishments that eEye Digital Security continuously receives. 

 

Abstract: "It's More Than a Microsoft World." While Microsoft has long been the primary target for criminals looking to exploit system vulnerabilities, now other applications such as Systems Management, QuickTime, iTunes and even security applications from companies like Symantec and McAfee are being used as a means of entry into the network. eEye's research team has identified these exploits as part of a growing trend of attacks that target consumer-oriented applications rather than the operating system itself, as well as bypass network-level security technologies traditionally used by organizations, including IDS gateways or gateway-based anti-virus systems. Now, applications like QuickTime or iTunes can represent a threat to the network's integrity. The reason is simple - Since Microsoft has been the dominant OS with the largest installed base, hackers naturally targeted it. However, as Microsoft has steadily improved its approach to security, criminals are looking to other "low hanging fruit." And they've had 5 whole years to practice against Microsoft, which means many applications are more vulnerable than ever. As an additional bonus Maiffret will demonstrate that although Microsoft has progressed in security they are not perfect. To help illustrate this fact Maiffret will be demonstrating live hacking a Windows Vista system with Office 2007.

7:00 - 8:00pm Speaker: Tom Brennan, President of NY/NJ OWASP Metro Tom specializes in providing business risk assessments and penetration testing of critical IT infrastructures for customers of his employer. In his spare time he spends way too much time on his computers (per his wife) donating time to OWASP projects and performing incident response. 

 

Abstract: OWASP Version 2 Testing Guide Tom will discuss the co-authored release of the new OWASP V2 Testing Guide. In addition, Tom will also discuss the merger of the NYC and NJ OWASP Chapters and the current OWASP projects underway. 

-- 

8:00pm - 9:00pm Speaker: Jeremiah Grossman, Founder/CTO - White Hat Mr. Grossman founded WhiteHat Security in 2001. Prior to WhiteHat, Mr. Grossman was an information security officer at Yahoo! responsible for performing security reviews on the company's hundreds of web applications. As one of the world's busiest web properties, with over 17,000 web servers for customer access and 600 web applications, the highest level of security was required. Before Yahoo!, Mr. Grossman worked for Amgen, Inc. 

 

Abstract: "HACKING INTRANET WEBSITES FROM THE OUTSIDE" This hour-long presentation will feature Jeremiah Grossman, WhiteHat Security Founder and CTO. Mr. Grossman will demonstrate: How a user is first infected or attacked using a malicious Web page or Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability; How a Web browser can be completely controlled or monitored remotely. How a Web browser can be used as a stepping stone to perform network reconnaissance on internal networks; and, How to exploit internal machines using a compromised Web browser

The State of New Jersey has declared a state of emergency.....  Perhaps it is a result of the NY/NJ Metro OWASP that is happening on Tuesday 4/17 at UBS from 6:00pm - 9:00pm?
 
This technical gathering of your peers will provide LIVE demonstration of HACKING VISTA and how-to-exploit internal machines using a compromised Web browser and more!
 
Ok... perhaps its just the rain ;) 
 
The meeting is still confirmed and will start at 6pm sharp with Marc Maiffret Chief Hacking Officer of eEye Digital Security kicking off our event.
