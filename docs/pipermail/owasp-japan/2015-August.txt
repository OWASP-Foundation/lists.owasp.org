Subject: [Owasp-japan] OWASP Hawaii Conference?
Message-ID: <55CA7135.5020707@owasp.org>

OWASP Japan,

Hello!

I am thinking of running an Application Security conference on the 
island of Kauai for OWASP.

* I am thinking March 2016 on Kauai, Hawaii.
* Perhaps 300 or so people maximum.
* 2-day conference w/ no or free training.
* This location: 
http://www.marriott.com/hotels/event-planning/business-meeting/lihku-courtyard-kauai-at-coconut-beach/ 


Any interest?

Aloha,

Hello Jim,

AppSec Kauai, Hawaii?
It will be great!

Sure I am interested. And we will have an outreach event next week,
so I will ask the audience how they feel about it.

Arigato!
