Title:  Attacking and Defending the Smart Grid

By SANS Certified Instructor, Justin Searle

Date: Tuesday, November 6

Time: 6:30 pm

Location: Fujisoft Akiba Plaza , Fujisoft Akihabara Building 6F

Note: Japanese language translation will be provided

Please RSVP to AsiaPacific at sans.org


Abstract:

The Smart Grid brings greater benefits for utilities and customer
alike, however these benefits come at a cost from a security
perspective. Unlike the over-hyped messages we usually hear from the
media, the sky is NOT falling. However, just like any other
technology, the systems and devices that make up the Smart Grid will
have weaknesses and vulnerabilities. It is important for us to
understand these vulnerabilities, how they can be attacked, and what
we need to do to defend against those attacks.

This presentation will explore how the increased functionality and
complexity of the Smart Grid also increases the Smart Grid's attack
surface, or in other words, increases the ways attackers can
compromise the Smart Grid's new infrastructures, systems, and business
models. We'll discuss several specific attack avenues against the
Smart Grid and the recommendations we are making to utilities and
vendors to mitigating and blocking these attacks.

Dear OWASP Japan,

*We are pleased to announce that the OWASP South Korea chapter will host
the OWASP AppSec APAC 2013 conference in Jeju, South Korea at the Hyatt
Regency Jeju. The event will be composed of 2 days of training (February
19-20), followed by 2 days of conference talks (February 21-22).

We are currently accepting both Training and Talk submissions:

   - Call for Training - Submission
Form<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dExUcGxHdWx2LUhpWXlob25LNVZUaHc6MA#gid=0>,
   Deadline Dec. 17, 2012.
   - Call for Papers - Submission
Form<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDdSdVN6Q2lEbl9MTWpTWF9fQmpjdUE6MA#gid=0>,
   Early Selection Deadline Dec 12, 2012. Final Selection Deadline Dec. 31,
   2012


We are also accepting applications for the Open Source
Showcase<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDUzVmFwclRYdEdhTWRaSWhEb1VNcEE6MA#gid=0>(project
demos) and OWASP
Project Track<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGZYWHhydVNSRF9kUUE5VTRPa09sbUE6MA#gid=0>(OWASP
project talks).

The APAC 2013 Open Source Showcase (OSS) is not just for OWASP projects.
All open source projects are encouraged to apply for an opportunity to
showcase, demo, and/or promote their project.

The APAC 2013 OWASP Project Track (OPT) forum differs from OSS in that only
OWASP Projects can apply to participate. This is a great opportunity for
OWASP project leaders to showcase their project as an official conference
presenter.

Applications for the OSS and OPT are due Friday, December 28th 2012, and
are considered on a rolling basis - so get moving!

More details on the Call for Training, Call for Papers, and Conference can
be found at appsecapac.org<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSecAsiaPac2013>.
