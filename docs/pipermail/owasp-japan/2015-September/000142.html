<PRE>Hello dear OWASPers in Japan,

the next OWASP board elections are coming and below you find the 
interviews with the current candidates.
It's a block of three interviews. Some comments are quite interesting, 
some are controversial.
At least not everyone has the same position. So you have something to 
choose from. :-)
And in case your membership has expired. There is time until Sep-30 to 
renew. The Asia membership is with just USD20 for one year a great 
bargain! Just follow the link in the text below. .

All the best and have a great start into the week.

Tobias
