Hello OWASP leaders,

The Appsec Asia Pac 2014 is over, and it enters the pantheon of
unforgettable OWASP conferences.  I wanted to give the leaders list an
update of the highlights, and mention some of the great successes of
the event.

As to be expected, the event was meticulously organized in a welcoming
venue in the heart of Tokyo. The organizers and the OWASP staff did an
amazing job of pulling it all together, which can only be described as
&quot;sprezzatura&quot; - cheerfully accomplishing extremely difficult tasks
while making it appear effortless.


A few key points from my perspective to success:


1. The conference smashed through the language barrier

- Every conference session had amazing, United Nations quality
translators.  The translators were so good and so fast, even jokes
were being translated in real time (was amazing to see a joke/pun
being made in English, followed by near simultaneous laughter from
both the English-speaking and Japanese-speaking audience).  These
super high quality translators eliminated the seemingly insurmountable
language barrier.  The fact they were able to do this translation with
even these very technical topics and industry-specific terms was
nothing short of amazing.

- The paid technical training classes (my class and Dave Wichers’
class) had volunteer translators who did great fantastic work.  The
participants in my class took copious notes and we had many in-depth
discussions, thanks to the real-time translation efforts of the
volunteers.  Little to nothing was &quot;lost in translation&quot;.



2. The OWASP community in Japan is very vibrant and growing rapidly

- It was clear OWASP is growing very rapidly in Japan.  Participants
from many regional chapters made an appearance at the event, from
various areas and representing luminary companies.  I have a strong
feeling we will be seeing continued growth in high-quality OWASP
projects originating out of the Japanese OWASP community.

- The OWASP members and organizers went far above and beyond taking
care of all the attendees from overseas.  The hospitality that I and
the other overseas participants experienced was unforgettable.  We had
multiple dinners, a trip to the top of the tallest tower in the world
(Sky Tree), a tour of Tokyo including an excursion in a spaceship
looking futuristic riverboat designed by a famous Manga artist and of
course a multilingual Karaoke night.



3. Skyrocketing global-level interest in application security

- The conference had an auspicious 404 attendees, and drew in
representatives from all over Japan, the region and the world. Clearly
significant bridges were built between so many geographically
dispersed people. This is one of the great benefits from the live
events - face to face communication especially those that transcend
language and national delineations.

- Events like this substantially strengthen OWASP globally.  As a
shameless self-serving example, I personally received commitments from
Japanese members to help translate the OWASP Appsec Tutorial Series,
making this OWASP outreach effort available new millions of potential
OWASP members.



So with deep gratitude I want to again recognize Riotaro Okada, Sen
Ueno, Robert Dracea and all the numerous other event organizers who
put in extreme effort and dedication to this event, along with the
indefatigable Samantha Groves and Laura Grau.  Also, a round of
applause for ALL past and present event organizers globally.  It is
your continued efforts unshackle OWASP out of the virtual and allow it
to thrive in the real world.


ありがとうみんなさん！


Jerry
