OWASP Leaders!



The Release Candidate for the OWASP Top 10 - 2013 is now available! (Attached)



It?s also available for Download here
http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202013%20-%20RC1.pdf



A press release for this should be coming out later today.



Please forward to all the developers and development teams you know!!
I?d love to get feedback from them too, and to start immediately
raising awareness about what?s changed in this update to the Top 10.
The primary change is the addition of the new category: A9-Using
Components with Known Vulnerabilities





We plan to release the final version of the OWASP Top 10 - 2013 in
April or May 2013 after a public comment period ending March 30, 2013.



Constructive comments on this OWASP Top 10 - 2013 Release Candidate
should be forwarded via email to OWASP-TopTen at lists.owasp.org. Private
comments may be sent to dave.wichers at owasp.org .  Anonymous comments
are welcome.  All  non-private comments will be catalogued and
published at the same time as the final public release.  Comments
recommending changes to the items listed in the Top 10 should include
a complete suggested list of 10 items, along with a rationale for any
changes. All comments should indicate the specific relevant page and
section.



Your feedback is critical to the continued success of the OWASP Top 10
Project. Thank you all for your dedication to improving the security
of the world?s software for everyone.



Thanks, Dave



OWASP Top 10 Project Lead
