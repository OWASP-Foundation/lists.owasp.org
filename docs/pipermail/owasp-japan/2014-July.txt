> Initiatives
> OWASP Winter Code Sprint
> We are thrilled to announce the launch of OWASP Winter Code Sprint
> (OWCS) for this upcoming Autumn/Winter (Sept 14-March 15).
> What is OWCS?
> The OWCS is a program to involve students with Security projects. By
> participating in OCWS a student can get real life experience while
> contributing to an open source project and getting university
> credits.
> How it works
> Any OWASP project that will give you university credits can
> participate in OCWS. Each project will be guided by an OWASP expert
> along with a professor. Students are graded by their University,
> based on success criteria identified at the beginning of the project.
> Projects are focused on developing security tools. It is required
> that the code any student produces for those projects will be
> released as Open Source. Universities are free to specify their own
> requirements to projects, such as written reports. OWASP does not
> influence the way grades are allocated. The OWASP advisers will
> provide any information professors need in order to grade their
> students.
> How to participate?
> As a Student:
> Review the list of OWASP Projects currently prticipating in OWCS     
>                                        Get in touch with the OWASP
