OWASP Reverse Engineering and Code Modification
Project<http://cts.vresp.com/c/?TheOWASPFoundation/cef5ada534/c38511f33d/2f5060634b>

This project educates security professionals about the risks of reverse
engineering and how to ensure that code cannot be reverse engineered or
modified. If you are placing sensitive code in an environment in which an
attacker can get physical access to that environment (read: mobile,
desktops, cloud, particular geographies), you should be concerned with the
risks of reverse engineering or unauthorized code modification. This
umbrella project will help you understand the risks and how to mitigate
them.

For more information, please contact the Project Leader, Jonathan
Carter<jonathan.carter.org>

OWASP Pyttacker Project

The OWASP Pyttacker Project is a portable Web Server that includes the
features needed for every Pentester when creating reports, helping to
create PoCs that show a more descriptive way to create awareness to the
businesses by demonstrating realistic but in-offensive "attacks" included
as part of the tool.

Robles.<Mario.Robles → owasp.org>

OWASP XSecurity Project

The OWASP XSecurity Project aims to provide the best free security tool
integrated with the IDE to assist iOS developers to develop secure iOS
apps. We now provide a security plugin for Xcode plus clang static analyzer
checkers for iOS application development. This plugin aims to reduce the
vulnerability made during development by detecting the vulnerability as it
is being created.

     OWASP Member Spotlight - APAC 2014 Planning Team - Japan

As an organization driven by it's membership community, it's high time we
dedicate some space to recognizing YOU!

We would like to take this opportunity to congratulate and to sincerely
thank the Japan team. This year's AppSec conference in Tokyo, Japan was
immensely successful in promoting the OWASP mission in the Japan region.

The turnout this year was our largest to date, and we have received great
feedback from attendees about speakers, session content and networking
events.

The Organizing Committee is extremely proud to have been able to bring
together more than 400 people from all over the world. Indeed this is a
great milestone in the history of our Global AppSec Conferences in the Asia
Pacific region and having your support and participation was priceless.
THANK YOU!
