Greetings,

When will the February OWASP meeting be? I am a Houston Chapter leader and
I will be in Tokyo and would like to schedule my visit during the February
meeting.  Could a Japan Chapter Leader email me off this list?

Thank you,

PSCOTT

Hello Paul,

Thank you for your message. We will have a chapter meeting each 3months,
but we have no plan in February so far. In February, some of us will go to
OWASP AppSec in Jeju island, how about you?

Anyway, if you can tell me your detailed schedule in Tokyo,
we will welcome you if possible.

Regards,
Rio
