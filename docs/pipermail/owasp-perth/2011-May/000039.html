<PRE>Hey All,

David and I are happy to announce that we'll be giving a refreshed session
on common web application security faults including live demos! If you
didn't catch us at AISA's TechDay last year then this is your opportunity to
see how minor vulnerabilities can be exploited.

RSVPing is VERY important as seats are limited, but the Australia / New
Zealand Testing Board (ANZTB) SIGISTs are a great opportunity to network
with not just security people but other QA friends in Perth!

Please see <A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Perth_Australia">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Perth_Australia</A> or the email
below for more details.

Cheers,

Christian Frichot

Dear Perth Tester

Networking opportunities and refreshments are also provided.

*Venue*

Holiday Inn, Perth

Banksia Room

*Agenda*



5:30 Welcome and ANZTB update
5:45 How minor vulnerabilities can do 'very bad things' (Part I) by
Christian Frichot and David Taylor
6:20 Networking and Refreshments
6:50 How minor vulnerabilities can do 'very bad things' (Part 2) by
Christian Frichot and David Taylor
7:25 Wrap up and close



*How minor vulnerabilities can do 'very bad things'
by Christian Frichot and David Taylor*

So the time has come. Your company has finally approved the project to
update your online web presence. A brand new, whiz-bang Content Management
System is being deployed and your developers are frantically coding away to
prepare a whole batch of fresh new content. Before you realise it, the
delivery date is a week away and you have some security guy screaming at you
about cross-site scripting issues!



Cross-site scripting? So what.



Does this experience sound familiar to you?**

 In this session Christian Frichot and David Taylor will spend some time
dissecting this common web application vulnerability, and just how serious
its impacts can be. Exploitation of cross-site scripting is no longer just
within the realm of nerdy, hacker types, new (and old) tools out there allow
this trivial vulnerability to be used for so much more, including keystroke
logging, and even forcing your iPhone to dial a number via Skype. For those
facing these issues there are plenty of resources which can help, and
Christian &amp; David will cover these as well.


Christian and David both work as internal security consultants for a
financial services organisation. They are both active members of the
Australian Information Security Association (AISA) and Open Web Application
Security Project (*OWASP*) Perth chapter.

*Please pass this on to anyone who may be interested.*



*Please RSVP to <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-perth">rsvp at anztb.org</A> *

*Spaces are limited so don&#8217;t miss out!*





Regards



*Karen Haig **| *General Manager
