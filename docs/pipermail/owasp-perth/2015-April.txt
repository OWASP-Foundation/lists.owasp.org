Hi OWASPers,

We have the details!

Date: Tuesday 14 April 2015
Time: 5:30pm to approx. 7:30pm
Venue: The Ernst & Young Building, 11 Mounts Bay Road, Perth

The brief is in the attached PDF.

If you want to attend, just shoot me an email. (Don't worry if you're not
an AISA Member).

Asterisk is putting on drinks, and EY is hosting the event, so it should be
a fun Tuesday evening.
