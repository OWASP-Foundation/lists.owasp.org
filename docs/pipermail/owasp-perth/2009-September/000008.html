<PRE>The OWASP Perth Chapter is excited to announce our next meeting event. 
This meeting is generously being hosted by IBM, who are providing a venue, 
catering and a presenter, Shlomi Cohen.  Shlomi works in the IBM Rational 
business unit and was fundamental in the development of their AppScan 
suite of products.  We haven't finalised the topic of the presentation 
just yet, but it is sure to be of interest to those in the web application 
security arena.

We apologise for the short notice of the meeting and hope you are able to 
join us for an educational and entertaining evening.

Date: Monday 7th of September, 2009
Time: 18:00 sign-in, 18:15 start
Location: IBM Building, 1060 Hay St. West Perth. WA. 6005
RSVP: <A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-perth">christian.frichot at bankwest.com.au</A>
