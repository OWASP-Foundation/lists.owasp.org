*TRAINING*
*
*

*2 Day Course - Assessing &amp; Exploiting Web Applications with Samurai-WTF
(Justin Searle)* - *Course Details &amp; Instructor
Bio&lt;<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/images/f/f4/Samurai-WTF_Course_Syllabus_v9.pdf">https://www.owasp.org/images/f/f4/Samurai-WTF_Course_Syllabus_v9.pdf</A>&gt;
*

Come take the official two-day Samurai-WTF training course given by one of
the founders and lead developers of the project! You will learn the latest
Samurai-WTF open source tools and as well as the latest techniques to
perform web application penetration tests. After a quick overview of pen
testing methodology, the instructors will lead you through the end-to-end
process of testing and exploiting several different web applications,
including client side attacks using flaws within the application. Different
sets of open source tools will be used on each web application, allowing
you to learn first hand the pros and cons of each tool. Primary emphasis of
these instructor lead exercises is how to integrate these tools into your
own manual testing procedures to improve your overall workflow. After you
have gained experience with the Samurai-WTF tools, you will be challenged
with a capture the flag event. This final challenge will give you time to
practice your new skills at your own pace and experiment with your favorite
new tools. This experience will help you gain the confidence and knowledge
necessary to perform web application assessments and expose you to the
wealth of freely available, open source tools.
