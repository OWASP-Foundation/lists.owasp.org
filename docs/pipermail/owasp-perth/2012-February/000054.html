<PRE>Hi everyone,
Sarah pushed out to the larger list, so if you get a double post apologies.
I've had a few people mention that they are not receiving sarah's email to
the OWASP community.

As you may have heard the OWASP Event is on in 2012 in Sydney Australia.
April 11-14th.
We've been able to confirm a number of excellent international and local
speakers. Our keynotes should also be fantastic.

The Web site (wiki page) for the event will be updated nearly every day
now, plus we've also got the registration and hotel venue bookings also
locked in.
All of this has been going on behind the scenes, and you will see lots of
changes in the next week, with the ability to register.

I know a number of people have previously attended. It's always been a
highly rated event, and with the committee in 2012, i think this will be
the best one yet!

If you haven't submitted a speaking or training session then you need to
submit the basic information this week. We are selecting most of the
speakers this week, and really need to finalise the schedule. See below for
details.
If you need more information, want to sponsor or get involved please
contact the detail below.

Just a reminder that the deadline for submission (for the first round of
selections) of the OWASP AppSec AsiaPac 2012 Call for Papers (CFP) and Call
for Trainers (CFT) is this Friday (February 17). The final closing date for
submissions is Friday, March 3, 2012.
