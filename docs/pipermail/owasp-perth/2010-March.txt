Hi Perth OWASP,

This was just posted to the OWASP Leaders list - as we're really close to
Singapore I thought you might be interested.

Regards,

Christian

Hi fellow leaders,

ISC2 is offering all paid OWASP members a 30% discount off standard
conference fee for SecureAsia at SG

The registration website is at
https://www.magnetmail.net/actions/email_web_version.cfm?recipient_id=311113152&message_id=966197&user_id=ITPGA&group_id=449939

If your members are interested to attend, please drop me a note for the
discount code.

(ISC)? members will earn up to 16 CPE credits; don?t forget to key in
your certification number upon registration.

PS: The 2 casinos in Singapore should be open by then, so if you feel
lucky, you can try your luck there. :-)

Regards
Onn Chee
OWASP Singapore
