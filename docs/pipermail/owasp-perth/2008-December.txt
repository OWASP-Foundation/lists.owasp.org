Hi All,

Just wanted to send a message out there to try and gauge how many
people are already part of this list, and I guess what you're current
level of use of OWASP materials or tools is.

I'll start off with myself.

My name's Christian and I currently work within the BankWest Security
Consulting Services (sounds a bit like the kick off to a round-robin
intro at an AA meeting!?). As part of my role we currently undertake
and help coordinate business as usual and project based Vulnerability
Assessments (VA), Penetration Testing (PT) and Application
Assessments.

1. Our current methodology used for app assessments is based, and
draws heavily, from the OWASP Testing Guide.
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project)

2. We *try* and ensure that our app architects and developers are
aware of the OWASP Top Ten.
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project)

3. One of our multitude of local proxies used in testing is the great
open source, WebScarab.
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project)

Some of the other projects that I'm personally interested in and
hopefully might make their way into work:
- OWASP .NET Project
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_.NET_Project)
- OWASP Application Security Verification Standard Project
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project)
- OWASP Code Review Project
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Code_Review_Project)
- OWASP Code Crawler
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Code_Crawler)
- OWASP AntiSamy Project .NET
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AntiSamy_Project_.NET)
- GTK+GUI for w3af Project
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:GTK_plus_GUI_for_w3af_Project).

The last one is interesting, because w3af is another tool that we
occasionally use in our suite of testing tools, and one of the
problems with it is its unintuitive interface (not to say that a GUI
will make it better, I believe some of the command interfaces need to
be a bit more intuitive).

Regards,

Christian

Following from Christian's lead...
Hi everyone, my name is David, and its been 3 hours since I last tested the
security of a web application.

I have been aware of OWASP for a number of years now.  My interest in the
organisation is primarily from the security testing perspective.  I don't
make any claim to skills in software development, but I have been doing
security assessment in one form or another for around 12 years.

I discussed the idea of starting a local OWASP chapter in Perth with several
people over the last maybe year or two.  However, when I finally got round
to looking into it I discovered, to my surprise, that I'd been beaten to the
punch by Josh Qwek.  (Nice work Josh)

Anyway, now that the deed has been done, I am really keen to help arrange
meetings on some sort of semi-regular basis.  I have spoken to Peter Wolski
from AISA and he has suggested that we could hold an inaugural OWASP meeting
as a joint OWASP / AISA event at the beginning of next year.  This would
take care of venue (E&Y office) and sponsorship / refreshments for the first
meeting.  After this, we can make our own plans.

How does this sound to everybody?

Regards,
Dave Taylor
