#Title
Design Flaws: Pwning easy as one, two, three!
#Abstract
This will be a talk around design and logic flaws vs. memory corruption
bugs. Nowadays, people are more and more focused on design flaws as opposed
to memory corruption bugs because of all of the defensive mechanisms in
place such as DEP, ASLR, Stack and Heap Cookies, ASCII Armor, RELRO, etc.
Logic and design flaw exploitation is usually a lot less time-consuming and
way more reliable since attackers don't mess with all of the aforementioned
mechanisms. I'll be demonstrating a real-world attack scenario against
products such as [CENSORED], chaining multiple design and logic flaws in
order to achieve full system compromise.

#Title
Patch In The Middle: Subverting Client Upgrades
#Abstract
Man in the middle proofs of concept often focus on stealing credentials,
but a well implemented MITM on an untrusted network opens up a number of
other interesting possibilities, particularly with regards to data
tampering. You may have seen for example pranks with a MITM proxy where all
website images are replaced with (lets say) lolcats, and perhaps using SSL
and not trusting bogus certs or unknown SSH host fingerprints may mitigate
this to an extent, but how about applications which aren't as paranoid as
we are? Plenty of apps have auto update functionality, but how trusting are
they with regards to the patches they download? In this session I take a
look at the a client MITM attack framework 'Evilgrade' which is designed to
subvert the auto-update function on a number of common apps, including
Skype, Winamp, Virtualbox and others.
