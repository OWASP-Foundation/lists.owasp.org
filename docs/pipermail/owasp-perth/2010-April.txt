Hi Perth OWASP,

Just to let you know that I'll be giving a talk on Web Application Security
and ESAPI tomorrow for BarCamp. (http://barcampperth.org/talks)

BarCamp is free to attend and will be a great casual environment if you want
to hang out with local people who are involved in web application delivery
and other social media/networking areas.

I think I might be the only "security" talk of the day, so if you're feeling
generous and want to help bolster our numbers PLEASE come down.

*About the day:*
"*BarCamp Perth 2010 will be held on April 10, 2010 at the Central Institute
of Technology in East Perth.*
*
*
*Setup will be from around 8am, with registration (getting your name badges
etc) from 8.30am. We'd like to kick off with a welcome oratory at 9am or
just after as we end up delaying the schedule a fair bit otherwise (Matt
just loves to rabbit on).*
*
*
*There will be Five Senses Coffee shots being pulled, so there's certainly
something to keep you going if you get there a little early - plus, we'd
love your help getting things setup!*
*
*
*Sessions usually run for 30 - 45 minutes. Calls for session topics will go
out soon as we're hoping to have a magically online system this year with
some soon to be revealed *
*features.*
*
*
*As more information comes to hand, we'll update the website to let you know
so keep an eye out. You can sign up even if you're still contemplating
coming - just don't tick the box saying you are yet - you can come back and
do that later. That way we can keep you in the loop on any really important
developments.*"

Regards,

Christian

Hi Perth OWASP again,

Just to give you some follow up information about Barcamp Perth 4.0.

I feel the session went really well, via feedback on Twitter and through
conversations, and as such am hoping to post some follow up information here
and via my blog.

My writeup of my presentation is here:

Subject: [Owasp-perth] Discount for AusCERT2010
Message-ID: <x2le06e291f1004111918r96298f79te3c9534a620d6b9c@mail.gmail.com>

The ninth AusCERT conference will take place from Sunday 16th to Wednesday
19th May 2010 followed by two days of workshops. The venue will be RACV
Royal Pines on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.

Benjamin Mosse and Paul Therialt are both presenting at AusCERT2010 and both
have previously presented at the OWASP Australian Conferences which AusCERT
supported in the past. ?For more program details please visit
http://conference.auscert.org.au/conf2010/

OWASP (Individual and Organizational Supporters) members CAN REGISTER AT THE
FOUR PLUS DELEGATE LEVEL. This is equal to a 27% discount off the single
EARLY BIRD delegate price. (17% OF THE NORMAL PRICE) Please put the initials
"10OWASP" in the "General Registration Comment" field when registering.

If you are planning to attend AusCERT2010 and are not yet an OWASP Member
then making the investment to become an OWASP Member today would pay for
itself with this discount. ?Further information on becoming an OWASP Member
is available from http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership
