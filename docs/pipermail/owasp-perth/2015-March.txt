Hey Perth OWASPians,

Long-time no email.

We're working to get some material sorted to do a co-joined AISA/OWASP
Meetup on the topic of Mobile App Sec.

The meeting is aimed for mid-April, and when we get more details I'll send
out more emails.

Hope everyone is keeping safe and secure.

Cheers,

Christian
