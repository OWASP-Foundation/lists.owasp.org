Hi All,

ECU are putting on a free security session that I thought you may be
interested in. Not strictly web app related, but interesting
none-the-less!

Hello Christian,

Yes, I will allow OWASP members to register for AusCERT2011 at the 4
plus member rate, providing there are at least 4 of you, of course!!

We're looking forward to another great conference, and it will be
great to see OWASP there.

Regards
Claire
