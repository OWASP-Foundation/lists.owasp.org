Hi OWASP Perth,

We had been planning to hold an OWASP meeting at ECU this Wednesday
afternoon.
We had posted details on the website, but I had not anounced this to the
mailing list.
Unfortunately we have had to cancel this meeting.

Hopefully we can book the next meeting in for April.

Regards,
David Taylor
