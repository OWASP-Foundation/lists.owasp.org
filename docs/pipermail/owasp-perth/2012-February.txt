	For Papers & UPDATE!
Message-ID: <CABv+uXZPj37GU2DuMVGb4RWJ10Jz8W89BXDK_7NZamVB6G7qxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
Sarah pushed out to the larger list, so if you get a double post apologies.
I've had a few people mention that they are not receiving sarah's email to
the OWASP community.

As you may have heard the OWASP Event is on in 2012 in Sydney Australia.
April 11-14th.
We've been able to confirm a number of excellent international and local
speakers. Our keynotes should also be fantastic.

The Web site (wiki page) for the event will be updated nearly every day
now, plus we've also got the registration and hotel venue bookings also
locked in.
All of this has been going on behind the scenes, and you will see lots of
changes in the next week, with the ability to register.

I know a number of people have previously attended. It's always been a
highly rated event, and with the committee in 2012, i think this will be
the best one yet!

If you haven't submitted a speaking or training session then you need to
submit the basic information this week. We are selecting most of the
speakers this week, and really need to finalise the schedule. See below for
details.
If you need more information, want to sponsor or get involved please
contact the detail below.

Just a reminder that the deadline for submission (for the first round of
selections) of the OWASP AppSec AsiaPac 2012 Call for Papers (CFP) and Call
for Trainers (CFT) is this Friday (February 17). The final closing date for
submissions is Friday, March 3, 2012.

*2 Day Course - Assessing & Exploiting Web Applications with Samurai-WTF
(Justin Searle)* - *Course Details & Instructor
Bio<https://www.owasp.org/images/f/f4/Samurai-WTF_Course_Syllabus_v9.pdf>
*

Come take the official two-day Samurai-WTF training course given by one of
the founders and lead developers of the project! You will learn the latest
Samurai-WTF open source tools and as well as the latest techniques to
perform web application penetration tests. After a quick overview of pen
testing methodology, the instructors will lead you through the end-to-end
process of testing and exploiting several different web applications,
including client side attacks using flaws within the application. Different
sets of open source tools will be used on each web application, allowing
you to learn first hand the pros and cons of each tool. Primary emphasis of
these instructor lead exercises is how to integrate these tools into your
own manual testing procedures to improve your overall workflow. After you
have gained experience with the Samurai-WTF tools, you will be challenged
with a capture the flag event. This final challenge will give you time to
practice your new skills at your own pace and experiment with your favorite
new tools. This experience will help you gain the confidence and knowledge
necessary to perform web application assessments and expose you to the
wealth of freely available, open source tools.

Date: Mon, 20 Feb 2012 20:25:58 +1000
Subject: [Owasp-perth] MITIGATE Seminar 2012 in Perth featuring Kevin Mitnick
Message-ID: <4F421FB6.90406@mitigateseminar.com>


NB: The offer outlined in this e-mail is only available until 11:59PM 
this coming Friday the 24th February 2012.

Hackers. Fraud. Disasters. Change. ROI.

As an Information Security professional, one of the most challenging 
parts of the job is explaining risks to business people.

Every year we spend time, money and effort upkeeping our knowledge, but 
sometimes forget that being able to communicate what we have learned to 
executives and managers is critical to the success of our role.

MITIGATE will be one of the most important professional development 
events you attend in 2012 - and it's being held locally in Perth.

Pre-sale tickets to this exciting one day seminar are being made 
available exclusively to a small number of professional bodies and 
associations, including OWASP.

The first of the five MITIGATE 2012 topics is "Hackers". Interest at the 
executive level in this area increased dramatically in 2011 as the rate 
and visibility of IT system compromises was splashed across the media.

As Microsoft noted in their recent Security Intelligence Report, 44.8% 
of malicious software they analysed required a person to cause the 
infection to occur. Social engineering is the art of manipulating people 
into taking action willingly and is the most common infection method 
used by hackers.

There is no one better to explain how to mitigate against social 
engineering hacks than Kevin Mitnick, and we are proud to announce he 
will be the MITIGATE 2012 speaker for the "Hackers" topic.

Kevin's hobby as an adolescent consisted of studying methods, tactics, 
and strategies used to circumvent computer security, and to learn more 
about how computer systems and telecommunication systems work.

As the world's most famous (former) hacker, Kevin has been the subject 
of countless news and magazine articles published throughout the world 
and was recently featured on the Nine Network's "60 Minutes" in 
Australia. He is now a New York Times best-selling author. His latest 
book "Ghost in the Wires" reveals the long-awaited inside story about 
his life.

MITIGATE tickets for general admission will be priced starting from 
$660. OWASP mailing list members can purchase one of the limited 
pre-sale tickets at the significantly discounted rate of $330 by 
clicking on the following link.

To reserve your ticket at this price do not hesitate to visit:

https://www.mitigateseminar.com/2012/tickets/?city=PER&org=OWASP

We look forward to your attendance!

Dear OWASP Chapter Leader or Board Member, 

You are receiving this email because you are listed on the OWASP wiki as the leader (or part of the leadership) of an OWASP Chapter. To ensure that all Chapter Leaders are aware of their responsibilities as well as the resources available to help them with their chapter, we are requesting that all OWASP Chapter Leaders read and agree to the revised Chapter Handbook (completed in December 2011).  The Handbook is available on the OWASP Wiki: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Leader_Handbook

Additionally, as a point of information, the funds available for each chapter (updated through the end of 2011) are available on the Donation Scorecard here:  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Donation_Scoreboard.  All funds are listed in USD and if your chapter is not listed, then your chapter account balance is zero.

Please submit your Chapter Handbook acknowledgement through this Google Form:  https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dF92bVI0bXRIUU85SHVwdUdlSHIyQmc6MQ no later than the end of February 2012. A response is requested from each member of a chapter's leadership team  and if we do not receive your response by then, we will assume you are "opting out" of chapter leadership going forward.  If no responses are received for a chapter, we will consider that chapter inactive.  Any funds will be donated to the foundation to support the Chapter Committee on a global scale.

Dear OWASP Chapter Leader,

This is the 4th email (original below) that has been sent to you requesting acknowledgement of the revised chapter handbook and confirmation that you are still interested in continuing as chapter leader.  We have not received any response from your chapter and if none is received by the end of February (in one week), we will move forward with tagging your chapter as inactive.  This will also result in the funds allocated to your chapter being reallocated to help other chapters.

I suspect quite a few people receiving this email are new chapter leaders who don't think it is necessary to respond because they just started their chapter... We need ALL chapter leaders who are currently active to respond.

Thanks for your time in completing the google form: https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dF92bVI0bXRIUU85SHVwdUdlSHIyQmc6MQ
