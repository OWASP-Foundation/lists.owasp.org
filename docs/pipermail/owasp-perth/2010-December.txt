Hi All,

With all the news and details coming out around the OWASP Summit 2011
I was keen to find out if anyone from Australia was intending on going
over.

I think it would be a real shame if there wasn't someone providing
feedback from our region at what appears to be a very important OWASP
event.

Hi all,

I think Christian identified a valid reason for some representation from
from Australia so that our voice can be heard.
Any ideas how we can enable that to happen?

Kind Regards,
Joshua
