<PRE>Hi all,

I just wanted to thank everybody that attended the developer training
session and chapter meeting that we held yesterday.  It was an excellent
event, and great to see so many people from the development and security
communities involved.  Thanks also to Bankwest and KC Soon for providing
the venue and catering.

If you would like to be informed of future OWASP Perth events, please sign
up for the chapter's mailing list here:
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-Perth">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-Perth</A>
We are always on the lookout for presenters, so if you have a topic that
you'd like to present on (and is in some way vaguely related to web
application security), *please get in touch*.

OWASP is a not-for-profit organisation that is run by volunteers.  If you'd
like to support the project, you can become an OWASP member, either
individually or as a company.  More information on OWASP membership and
sponsorship opportunities can be found here:
<A HREF="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership_Map">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership_Map</A>

Finally, I just wanted to announce some recent changes to the chapter
leadership. After several years of service, Josh and Tim have stepped down
from chapter leadership to allow for some new blood.  I'd like to thank
them both for their efforts with OWASP.
Chris Arnold has agreed to join Christian and myself in leading the
chapter.  Chris is an experienced software architect with Ventyx and brings
a much needed development perspective to the chapter.
We would ideally like to take on one more chapter lead, to bring the total
to four.  I would like to invite an expressions of interest for the
remaining 'seat'.  Please email me if you'd be willing to help out.

Regards,
--
