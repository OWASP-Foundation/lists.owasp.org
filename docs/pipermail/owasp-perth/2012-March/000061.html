 Hello!

We are pleased to announce the first meeting of Ruxmon Perth will upon us
very shortly. For those of you who are not aware Ruxmon is a monthly
meeting of the security community that has taken place in Sydney and
Melbourne for some time now. Discussion has been under way with Ruxcon for
sometime now to bring these meetings to Perth and we have finally made all
the required arrangements.

The Ruxcon Team have established monthly meetings in Perth, Melbourne and
Sydney. The aim of the meetings is to encourage individuals to perform a
short presentation on computer security or a related topic in front of a
small audience. The monthly meetings are open to everyone and attendance is
free.  These meetings feature two short presentations (between 5-20
minutes) followed by time for discussion and networking. We encourage
participation from everyone and hope to see a variety of presentations over
the coming months. Any topic is welcome, a presentation could be as simple
as speaking for 5 minutes about a project you are currently working on, or
day to day work tasks within your given field. The meetings are conducted
under Chatham House rules to encourage sharing in a safe environment.

Please come and join us for the first meeting of Ruxmon Perth, the details
are provided below.

When: Friday, March 16th, 2012
Where: Edith Cowan University, Mt Lawley, Building 10, Room 308
Time: 6pm
Registration: No registration required

Talk 1
Title: A BeEFy Talk
Speaker: Christian Frichot

When was the last time you performed a penetration test and were able to
successfully exploit a publicly accessible, vulnerable Apache instance? Or
maybe the old-days where you could safely knock away for hours on an
exposed FTP service until the username password combination clicked
together. Like it or not, external perimeter controls have become so simple
and ubiquitous these days you rarely come across &#8216;trivial-to-exploit&#8217;
systems, in fact, when was the last time you came across a small-to-medium
(or larger) enterprise that didn&#8217;t use web-proxying services for their
colleagues when browsing the net?

The Browser Exploitation Framework is designed to assist the penetration
tester in leveraging the power of the web-browser to scan internal
networks, exploit other systems, proxy requests or basically anything else
you can think of doing with javascript. This session will give a summary of
what makes BeEF tick, and how to code up extensions or modules, with an
example extension being created from start to finish demonstrating some new
social engineering capability (think QR Code + BeEF hooking).

Talk 2
Title: IDN Homograph Mitigation Strategies
Speaker: Peter Hannay

The advent of internationalised domains has introduced a new threat with
the Unicode character sets allowing visual mimicry of common domain names
using these characters. IDN homographs have been a pressing issue since
2003 when they were proposed, the security implications considered, a
flurry of patches and then forgotten about. These protections slipped out
of source trees over the years and eventually with IDNs being implemented
for several TLDs they came back into fashion. In this talk we explore the
efficacy of IDN homograph mitigation strategies in web browsers, email
clients, mobile devices and evaluate the potential for social attacks and
awesomeness.

I look forward to seeing you at this meeting of the Perth security
community.
