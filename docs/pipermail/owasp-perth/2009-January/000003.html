and our own sponsors; please contact the chapter leaders if you are in a
position to assist with either of these.

Title:
Threat Modelling in the Software Development Lifecycle

Presenter: Christian Frichot

Synopsis:
One of the most important concepts being promoted in the security industry
is security in the software development lifecycle. This concept is
important due to two primary factors:
1. It is generally recognised that by shifting security activities closer
towards the requirements gathering stage, or the design stage, that less
vulnerabilities will make their way into the production systems.  2. It is
also recognised that the cost of mitigating vulnerabilities increases later
in the lifecycle.

Two of the more common methodologies for embedding security into the
software development lifecycle are Microsoft's Security Development
Lifecycle (SDL), and OWASP's Comprehensive, Lightweight Application
Security Process (CLASP). One of the critical components of both these
methodologies is Threat Modelling, which aims to identify and document,
within the design phase, likely risks that may impact upon a system.

By walking through a case study I hope to demonstrate the effectiveness of
addressing risk during the earlier stage of the software development
lifecycle, and that these activities are not solely the responsibility of
the &quot;security guy&quot;, but all participants in a software project including
the project manager, business stakeholder and software designer.

Bio:
Christian Frichot is currently employed by BankWest working within the
Security Consulting Services team. His core responsibilities include
phishing and online fraud response, security assessments, information risk
assessments and other ad-hoc information security consulting.  Christian
has previously held roles within KAZ as an Information Security Consultant
and Rio Tinto as an Information Security Advisor for the Diamonds business
unit.
Christian hopes to spend more time in '09 focusing on education and
application security, where he feels more effort needs to be applied.
