Subject: [Owasp-perth] Jim Manico (OWASP) visiting Perth in May
Message-ID: <CAAKmKbwKwuXQiurULoCv=B=i8J3apaGfm8u_OEYGcir-2NjyUg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Jim Manico from the OWASP board will be visiting Perth in early May.  Jim
has kindly offered to run some developer training, and to present at an
OWASP Perth chapter meeting.  If you are interested in attending either of
these, please register your interest here: http://surveymonkey.com/s/5YYF5H3

Both of these events (dev training, and the meeting) will be free, but we'd
really like to encourage attendees to consider becoming a member of OWASP.
 It isn't expensive, and your membership fees help to ensure that OWASP can
keep on fighting the good fight!

Regards,
--
