Subject: [Owasp-perth] CFP - OWASP "Tutorial" - 10 Nov in Sydney
Message-ID: <CAFCvB5LzVL3hcqD=ugOzHZDY2_Y=uEEpoY8rYmH1qomZ1MrrVQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I would like to thank Wouter for his offering two meeting rooms at
Ernst & Young at World Square (Sydney).

We are seeking speaker(s) who would be interested in delivering a
tutorial (i.e. up to six hours) which can either be based on an OWASP
Project (you don't need to be the Project Leader to present on an
OWASP Project) or related to Web Application Security.

If you are interested please either get in touch direct or via
https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-australia.  All
submissions will be logged via owasp-australia and put up to a vote.

Preference will given to interstate speakers due to their limited
availability in Sydney who have travelled for
