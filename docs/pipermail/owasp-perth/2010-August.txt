Dear Colleagues,



I have been asked to be a panellist for the above event organised by AISA (
www.aisa.org.au) on 17 Aug 2010.

Sorry for the short notice but here are the details:



Below is a brief summary from AISA's event page:

****************************************************************

*Log management is a necessary task in Security Management, but is often
neglected. There are various pressures being placed on businesses, such as
audit and compliance, industry standards (eg PCI, APRA), internal security
maturity which have allowed organisations to understand the benefits to be
gained from undertaking a SEIM project.*

* *

*There are many options for organisations looking to develop log management
and security incident response processes, which range from open source
syslog solutions, through to vendor supplied SEIM products and cloud based
monitoring solutions.*

* *

*A panel selected from a variety of industries including representation from
security consulting, corporate and vendor will discuss the considerations,
options and benefits of employing SEIM technology and processes.*

*Our MC: Steve Schupp - AISA Perth Branch Executive*
