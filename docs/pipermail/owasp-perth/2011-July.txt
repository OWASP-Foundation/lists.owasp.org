 ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) v.2.2.1

Hi OWASP Perth,

If you haven't had a chance to check out either ModSecurity or the OWASP
ModSecurity Core Rule Set now is probably a fantastic opportunity.

Mod_Security is an open source Web Application Firewall (WAF) in the form of
an Apache Module. So if you're websites are leveraging Apache for HTTP(S)
delivery then looking at something like mod_security is likely to help
compliment your defence in depth strategy.

The OWASP Core Rule Set (
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_ModSecurity_Core_Rule_Set_Project)
is a set of default rules that you can apply to mod_security to ease the
installation.

Certainly something to check out if you use Apache.

Thanks,

Christian Frichot

Subject: [Owasp-leaders] Announcing Release of OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule
Set (CRS) v.2.2.1
To: owasp-leaders at lists.owasp.org


I am pleased to announce the release of OWASP ModSecurity CRS v2.2.1.

This is a significant update with regards to SQL Injection protections.
 Trustwave's SpiderLabs Team conducted an analysis/review of the ModSecurity
SQL Injection Challenge Level II evasions -
http://www.modsecurity.org/demo/challenge.html and made many updates to now
detect the evasion techniques used during the challenge.  SpiderLabs will
soon be releasing a blog post providing details about the successful SQLi
evasions used against the OWASP CRS >v.2.2.1 during the SQLi Challenge.
 Keeping responsible disclosure in mind, we have delayed public release of
this blog post until we had an updated CRS for the community to install that
detected these evasions.

**** It is highly recommended that you update your CRS installs ASAP to gain
the improved SQL Injection protections. ****

===========

Further information is available from
http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/ and if anyone want to contribute

Can everyone please take a moment to complete http://doodle.com/2zvqtex6hk2tzvvp

I would like to close this poll on 15 August and the reason for the
early notice is due to people attention focusing on BlackHat/DefCon.

Subject: OWASP National Event during AISA National Conference 2011?
To: owasp-australia at lists.owasp.org


Keith Price (AISA) and I discussed the possibility of scheduling an
OWASP National Event around their (i.e. AISA) National Conference on
Wednesday 9 November 2011 during the OWASP/AISA Session at AusCERT
2011.

I have therefore created a poll on http://doodle.com/2zvqtex6hk2tzvvp
to schedule either a half or full day(s) OWASP National Event on the
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.

Can everyone please vote for their days and associated times,
especially if you have to travel interstate, so we can start
considering a venue in Sydney?

For those of you interstate, it is not my preference to host this in
Sydney but it would tie in nicely with those who intent to travel for
the AISA National Conference.

Please contact me direct at christian.heinrich at owasp.org with any questions?
