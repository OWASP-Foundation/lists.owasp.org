<PRE>Hi Perth OWASP,

Just to let you know that I'll be giving a talk on Web Application Security
and ESAPI tomorrow for BarCamp. (<A HREF="http://barcampperth.org/talks">http://barcampperth.org/talks</A>)

BarCamp is free to attend and will be a great casual environment if you want
to hang out with local people who are involved in web application delivery
and other social media/networking areas.

I think I might be the only &quot;security&quot; talk of the day, so if you're feeling
generous and want to help bolster our numbers PLEASE come down.

*About the day:*
&quot;*BarCamp Perth 2010 will be held on April 10, 2010 at the Central Institute
of Technology in East Perth.*
*
*
*Setup will be from around 8am, with registration (getting your name badges
etc) from 8.30am. We'd like to kick off with a welcome oratory at 9am or
just after as we end up delaying the schedule a fair bit otherwise (Matt
just loves to rabbit on).*
*
*
*There will be Five Senses Coffee shots being pulled, so there's certainly
something to keep you going if you get there a little early - plus, we'd
love your help getting things setup!*
*
*
*Sessions usually run for 30 - 45 minutes. Calls for session topics will go
out soon as we're hoping to have a magically online system this year with
some soon to be revealed *
*features.*
*
*
*As more information comes to hand, we'll update the website to let you know
so keep an eye out. You can sign up even if you're still contemplating
coming - just don't tick the box saying you are yet - you can come back and
do that later. That way we can keep you in the loop on any really important
developments.*&quot;

Regards,

Christian
