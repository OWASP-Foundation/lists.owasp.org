Dear OWASP Australia -
*We are pleased to announce that the OWASP South Korea chapter will host
the OWASP AppSec APAC 2013 conference in Jeju, South Korea at the Hyatt
Regency Jeju. The event will be composed of 2 days of training (February
19-20), followed by 2 days of conference talks (February 21-22).

We are currently accepting both Training and Talk submissions:

   - Call for Training - Submission
Form<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dExUcGxHdWx2LUhpWXlob25LNVZUaHc6MA#gid=0>,
   Deadline Dec. 17, 2012.
   - Call for Papers - Submission
Form<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDdSdVN6Q2lEbl9MTWpTWF9fQmpjdUE6MA#gid=0>,
   Early Selection Deadline Dec 12, 2012. Final Selection Deadline Dec. 31,
   2012


We are also accepting applications for the Open Source
Showcase<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDUzVmFwclRYdEdhTWRaSWhEb1VNcEE6MA#gid=0>(project
demos) and OWASP
Project Track<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGZYWHhydVNSRF9kUUE5VTRPa09sbUE6MA#gid=0>(OWASP
project talks).

The APAC 2013 Open Source Showcase (OSS) is not just for OWASP projects.
All open source projects are encouraged to apply for an opportunity to
showcase, demo, and/or promote their project.

The APAC 2013 OWASP Project Track (OPT) forum differs from OSS in that only
OWASP Projects can apply to participate. This is a great opportunity for
OWASP project leaders to showcase their project as an official conference
presenter.

Applications for the OSS and OPT are due Friday, December 28th 2012, and
are considered on a rolling basis - so get moving!

More details on the Call for Training, Call for Papers, and Conference can
be found at appsecapac.org<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSecAsiaPac2013>.
If you have any questions, please email the APAC conference committee:
