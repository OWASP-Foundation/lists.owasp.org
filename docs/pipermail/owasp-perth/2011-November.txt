There are approximately four tickets remaining for both the "End User"
i.e. 9AM - 11AM and "Vendor/Consultant" i.e. 1PM-3PM sessions being
held tomorrow (Thursday).

They have been divided based on profession i.e. those who provide
webappsec products and/or services must register as the 1PM-3PM
session.  If you are unsure then please register for this session.

If you registered with a "disposable" e-mail address and hold a
previous ticket then can you please reregister at
http://owasp-sydney-australia.eventbrite.com/.  However, can you
please send an e-mail to [christian.heinrich at owasp.org] with a method
to contact you as I have been unable to reach everybody who registered
previously.

Hi All,

Myself and David of OWASP Perth will be attending and presenting at this
year's AISA Perth Techday.

The event is held on Friday the 2nd of December and should be a good event
to network and socialise with other local security and web security
professionals.

You can find the details below[1], and if you're keen to attend, please let
me know by emailing me at xntrik at gmail.com
