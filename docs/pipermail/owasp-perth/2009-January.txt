Title:
Threat Modelling in the Software Development Lifecycle

Presenter: Christian Frichot

Synopsis:
One of the most important concepts being promoted in the security industry
is security in the software development lifecycle. This concept is
important due to two primary factors:
1. It is generally recognised that by shifting security activities closer
towards the requirements gathering stage, or the design stage, that less
vulnerabilities will make their way into the production systems.  2. It is
also recognised that the cost of mitigating vulnerabilities increases later
in the lifecycle.

Two of the more common methodologies for embedding security into the
software development lifecycle are Microsoft's Security Development
Lifecycle (SDL), and OWASP's Comprehensive, Lightweight Application
Security Process (CLASP). One of the critical components of both these
methodologies is Threat Modelling, which aims to identify and document,
within the design phase, likely risks that may impact upon a system.

By walking through a case study I hope to demonstrate the effectiveness of
addressing risk during the earlier stage of the software development
lifecycle, and that these activities are not solely the responsibility of
the "security guy", but all participants in a software project including
the project manager, business stakeholder and software designer.

Bio:

Christian hopes to spend more time in '09 focusing on education and
application security, where he feels more effort needs to be applied.
