Subject: [Owasp-perth] "Sid" - "Secure Coding" Course - March 2014
Message-ID: <CAGKxTUS7uM-8Kai5BDknAXbEziYeD-OWUQi=PzAoyC868pkJFA@mail.gmail.com>

"Sid" Sumit Siddharth would like to deliver his "Secure Coding" course
in the Sydney CBD the first week of March 2014 during his travel to
New Zealand from the UK.

Sid has presented on SQL Injection at the OWASP Australian Conference
in 2009 and was selected for RUXCON/Breakpoint last year (2013).

Further information on this unique course is available from
http://www.notsosecure.com/secure_coding/

The cost per student is over two days is $1500 AUD, which is over 50%
cheaper than RUXCON/Breakpoint.

For those of you who have an interest attending, including those
interstate, can let Sid know at sydney-march-2014 at notsosecure.com
before the end of this month (i.e. January 2014)?
