Subject: [Owasp-perth] Ruxmon This Friday!
Message-ID: <CA+SZ5UTmgKLgB5g2VcuVc0qmoyectgAX=3J-91AqtijPKrc6KQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All,

Sorry for the late notice, I've been busy helping Peter out with the Perth
Ruxmon chapter.

On that topic, I just wanted to let you all know that the Perth Ruxmon
meeting is happening this Friday afternoon at ECU Mt Lawley.

---Talks---
##Hackerspace

A hackerspace is a community of people which has come together to share
knowledge, to socialise, and to collaborate across disciplines including
science, electronics, computing, robotics and the arts; most hackerspaces
are member funded, and have a physical space that includes a communal set
of tools, workshops and studios.  In this talk, Peter will provide a short
introduction to Perth's hackerspace, the Artifactory, the kinds of things
we do, and how you can get involved.

Peter is an aspiring hacker and polymath.  When he's not working on
projects for money or the activist community, he likes to bask in the
elegance and history of classic computers and operating systems, as well as
minimalist platforms and microcontrollers.

##You won't believe the things I've seen

In this lightning talk, entitled "You won't believe the things I've seen",
David will provide a countdown of the top 5(?) ridiculous, lazy or just
plain mind-blowingly stupid vulnerabilities that he's come across while
penetration testing.  The names will be changed to protect the guilty, but
hopefully this will serve as a reminder of how not to write web
applications.

David is a breaker, not a builder.  Despite a diverse information security
career, he is happiest when he is hacking stuff.

---Time/Place---
Friday 29th of June
ECU Mt Lawley, Building 10, Room 131
6:00pm

---Registration---
None!

Thanks guys!
