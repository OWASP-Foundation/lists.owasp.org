OWASP Perth,

 

I am currently assisting Justin Derry in organizing two panel sessions for
the upcoming OWASP Australian Conference later this month and would like to
solicit questions for these panels from the OWASP community.

 

The first panel will be on Web Application Security and the second panel
will be dedicated to OWASP (e.g. OWASP Projects, Chapters, etc).

 

Please feel free to respond to me either via this Mailing List or direct at
christian.heinrich at cmlh.id.au and please indicate how you would like to be
attributed when your question is asked i.e. I am more then willing to accept
contributions from people who wish to remain anonymous

 

 

Regards,

Christian Heinrich

Everyone,
Make sure you register online and you get to the OWASP Conference coming up
in the Gold Coast in two weeks.
The conference has an awesome set of speakers, topics and agenda for
application security, and as last year
this year is set to be even better.

There are numerous events for networking and meeting up with fellow
application security experts.
The cost of the conference is minimal and there is stil room available for
training attendees also.

Don't forget it's the 25-27th of February at the Gold Coast Convention
Centre. You can even stay over the weekend for a short break.
Cost of flights is cheap currently with Jetstar and Virgin Blue into the
Gold Coast, and there are deals online on the Conference page for cheap
accomodation.

If you have any questions regarding the conference, please feel free to
email me at
jderry at owasp.org

Regards
Justin

OWASP Perth,

I have received a number of great questions from the community and I am
intending to finalize the questions for the two Panel Sessions this weekend.

Therefore, I will be accepting questions related to Web Application Security
and OWASP until this Friday 20 February.

It is not too late to submit a question for consideration as they will be
presented to the Panel by order of priority.
