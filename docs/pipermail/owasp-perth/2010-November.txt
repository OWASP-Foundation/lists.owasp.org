Message-ID: <AANLkTimFZgYuFkGAbhwscfSz1LqL==PRNCO-YsVuVst_@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

David and myself will be running a session at the upcoming AISA[1] techday.

We're going to be giving a quick recap on common web application
vulnerabilities, and then moving into methods in which these can be
exploited, in particular with tools like BeEF and Metasploit.

I don't know how many seats are available, but if you're interested this
would be a great way to learn more about these issues and network with your
peers.

The registration page is available here:

Cheers,

Christian
