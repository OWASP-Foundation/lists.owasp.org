Hi all,

Christian and I will be presenting a workshop on behalf of OWASP at the
Perth AISA tech day on Friday the 4th of December.
More information on the tech day (including online registration) can be
found here:

OWASP members are able to attend our session (and the other sessions) for
free.  However, if you want free lunch and post-event drinks, you'll need
to be an AISA member.

Hope to see you there.

Regards,
David Taylor
