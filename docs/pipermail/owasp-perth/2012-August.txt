Hey Perth OWASPers,

I need to firstly apologise for not contacting you guys all a lot sooner
with regards to meetings and goings-onings.

Anyway, wanted to quickly shoot out a message to let you know that Ruxmon
is happening this Friday, and the presenters are talking about some stuff
that I think you might find very applicable.

Sorry also for the short notice.

All the information you need is available here:

Cheers,

Christian '@xntrik' Frichot
