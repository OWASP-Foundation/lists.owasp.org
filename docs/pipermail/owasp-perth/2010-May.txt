I am seeking an alternate speaker for the OpenSAMM lightning/turbo
talk as Justin may not be attending AusCERT2010.

Preference will be given to current OWASP members who have not yet
presented at an AusCERT conference.

Practical experience with OpenSAMM is not a requirement as the slides,
etc are available from http://www.opensamm.org/download/ and a video
of Pravir Chandra (Project Leader) presenting is available from
http://vimeo.com/6495398

Please note you will need to shorten the existing presentation to 10
to 20 minutes as the purpose of this session is to introduce people to
OpenSAMM and a number of other key OWASP Projects.

If you are interested then please contact me directly at
christian.heinrich at owasp.org?

I would like to thank everyone that offered their help and look
forward to seeing you all at the OWASP session during AusCERT2010.
