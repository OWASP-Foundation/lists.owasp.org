Good afternoon all,

I have some updated information for the free OWASP developer training
session and OWASP Perth chapter meeting with Jim Manico coming up in May.

If you want to attend either of these and haven't already signed up, please
register your interest at the following location:
http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/5YYF5H3
Attendance at the training will be limited to 60, and spaces are filling up
quickly.
If you have previously registered but find yourself unable to attend,
please let me know so that we can let somebody else in.

*OWASP Developer Training*
Topic: "Building Secure Web Applications Bootcamp"
Date: Wednesday the 8th of May 2013
Time: 13:00 - 17:00
Location: Bankwest Place building

*OWASP Perth Chapter Meeting*

Bankwest have kindly volunteered to host the training and the chapter

 Enter the foyer from Murray St.  All visitors will need to sign in at the
concierge desk and will be directed from there.
