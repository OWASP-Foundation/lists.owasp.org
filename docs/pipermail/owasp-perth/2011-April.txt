Hey All,

I'll be giving a presentation in May as part of ECU's SecAU Special
Interest Group.

Date: Wednesday 18th of May, 2011
Time: 3:00 - 4:00 pm (Refreshments from 4:00pm)
Location: ECU Mount Lawley Campus, Building 17, Room 17.103
RSVP: Lisa McCormack on 6304 5176 or l.mccormack at ecu.edu.au

Cross-site scripting: You don?t always know who the actors are (May 2011)

The Brief
So the time has come. Your company has finally approved the project to
update your online web presence. A brand new, whiz-bang Content
Management System is being deployed and your developers are
frantically coding away to prepare a whole batch of fresh new content.
Before you realise it, the delivery date is a week away and you have
some security guy screaming at you about cross-site scripting issues!

Cross-site scripting? So what.

Does this experience sound familiar to you?

In this session Christian Frichot will spend some time dissecting this
common web application vulnerability, and just how serious its impacts
can be. Exploitation of cross-site scripting is no longer just within
the realm of nerdy, hacker types, new (and old) tools out there allow
this trivial vulnerability to be used for so much more, including
keystroke logging, and even forcing your iPhone to dial a number via
Skype. For those facing these issues there are plenty of resources
which can help, and Christian will cover these as well.

You can see the brochure here:

Don't forget to RSVP to Lisa on 6304 5176 or l.mccormack at ecu.edu.au

Kind Regards,

Christian Frichot

Hi everyone,

It is with great pleasure that I announce OWASP New Zealand Day's
return in 2011, continuing the tradition started by Roberto in 2009.
The third OWASP New Zealand Day conference will be happening thanks to
the support provided by the University of Auckland, which will kindly
offer the same conference venue of the last two years. Entry to the
event will, as in the past, be free.

OWASP New Zealand Day 2011 will be held on Thursday July 7th, 2011. If
you wish to attend OWASP New Zealand Day 2011, please register your
attendance:

http://www.regonline.com/owaspnzday2011

Please remember that registration is mandatory and only available
online. Registration will be closing on the 15th June 2011. For those
of us who like to procrastinate, a reminder will be sent closer to the
time - but it would help planning if you registered sooner rather than
later.

The event web site is available at the following address:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2011

For people who missed out on the first two events, OWASP New Zealand
Day is a single day security conference entirely focused on web
application security. Talks are given both by developers and
penetration testers, giving a rounded view on the threats facing web
applications - and how to mitigate them.
In 2009 & 2010, the event had a panel of 9 speakers and attracted more
than 150 participants from all over New Zealand.

For more information, please visit last year's event conference web site:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2010

In the past, sponsors have offered coffee and lunch to all the
participants. Hopefully, we should be able to do the same this year.
New sponsors are always welcome so if you know of a company or anyone
willing to sponsor, please contact us directly at
nick.freeman at owasp.org and scott.bell at owasp.org.

The Call For Papers (CFP) has also been released, details of which can
be found at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2011#tab=Call_for_Papers_and_review_process



Happy hacking,

Nick Freeman & Scott Bell
OWASP New Zealand Chapter Leaders
