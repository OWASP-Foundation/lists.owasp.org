Subject: [Owasp-perth] Perth's CryptoParty
Message-ID: <CA+SZ5UQo0Jr8XCxGEixq7PkssGrYiU00Gf64_7AZXvJJwNHw=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All,

There's an event coming up this Thursday that you might be interested in.
Perth's inaugural #CryptoParty!

You can find out more information here:

https://cryptoparty.org/wiki/Perth

The background behind the event:

  What is CryptoParty? Interested parties with computers, devices, and
  the desire to learn to use the most basic crypto programs and the
  fundamental concepts of their operation! CryptoParties are free to
  attend, public, and are commercially non-aligned.

Whilst not a traditional web security event, you might walk away learning
some new stuff, or better yet, teaching other people some new stuff!

Feel free to sign up on the wiki itself, or, on the FB event (which is
linked to from the wiki)

Cheers,

Christian
