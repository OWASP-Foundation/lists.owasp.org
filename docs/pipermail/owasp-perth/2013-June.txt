Subject: [Owasp-perth] OWASP Membership - New Lifetime Membership
Message-ID: <CA+SZ5UR1_FYLznUVk7N1Q+WL-vK9mcXK5jak6W0c-1mZNERHuA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All,

Firstly I'm sorry I wasn't able to attend any of the recent Jim Manico
sessions that were held last month, from all accounts it sounds like they
were excellent!

Also thanks again to Bankwest for helping with hosting the events.

For those who haven't yet joined OWASP, and perhaps you've been uhmming and
ahhing, they've just announced their (American) Summer Membership Drive.
And for the first time they're now offering new special lifetime
memberships.

Regardless, if you become a paid member in the first 10 days of June you go
in the running for a bunch of awesome stuff, including full conference
passes to BH Vegas or OWASP's AppSec USA.

You can read more about it here:
http://owasp.com/index.php/Summer_2013_Membership_Drive

If you have any other questions, don't forget to let us know on this list.

Cheers,

Christian Frichot

The OWASP Top 10 project has updated and released the final version of the
OWASP Top 10 for 2013 based on the feedback it received during the formal
comment period.

The OWASP Top 10 for 2013 is as follows:

A1 Injection

A2 Broken Authentication and Session Management

A3 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

A4 Insecure Direct Object References

A5 Security Misconfiguration

A6 Sensitive Data Exposure

A7 Missing Function Level Access Control

A8 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

A9 Using Known Vulnerable Components

A10 Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards

The final release can be downloaded from the main project page at:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10

Or the Google Top 10 Project page at: https://code.google.com/p/owasptop10/

If you simply want to download the document immediately, its available at:

http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202013.pdf

Thanks to everyone for their contributions to this important OWASP project!

Please spread the word to those organizations you are involved in to raise
awareness of these issues, particularly the new and unfamiliar* A9:** Using
Known Vulnerable Components*. With the rapid increase in the pace of
development and the tempo of issuing new releases, it's getting even more
challenging to avoid introducing these risks in modern applications. This
rapid development tempo is also encouraging the increased use of 3rd party
as well as internally developed components, which have security issues just
like any other software. That's why A9 was introduced, to raise awareness
that developers need to make sure they are not continuing to use components
with known vulnerabilities.

Thanks, Dave
