<PRE>&gt;<i> When: Monday, April 13, 2009 4:00 PM-6:00 PM (GMT-05:00) Eastern Time (US &amp; Canada).
</I>&gt;<i> Where: The Hartford: 55 Farmington Avenue, The Great Room
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Hartford Chapter of OWASP is pleased to announce Scott Ambler as our first speaker of the year. This event is 100% free to attend. Seating is limited. We will be starting promptly at 4pm&gt; ...&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agility and Security: Two Great Tastes Which Go Great Together
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Security is usually an afterthought on software development projects, regardless of the paradigm being followed, but it doesn't have to be this way. Traditional approaches would have you add a lot of additional bureaucracy to your process and the agile extremists will tell you to write up some stories on index cards. Good luck with those strategies. Disciplined agile teams, particularly those working at scale, have discovered ways to address enterprise issues such as security in effective manners which gets the job done without unnecessary bureaucracy, albeit with more sophisticated tools than a stack of index cards. This presentation overviews the Agile Process Maturity Model (APMM), what it means to scale agile approaches to meet your real-world needs, and strategies for addressing security concerns in a disciplined agile manner.
</I>&gt;<i> Scott W. Ambler is the Practice Leader for Agile Development at IBM Corporation. He works in the IBM Methods group developing process materials and travels the world helping clients to understand and adopt software processes that are right for them. A prolific author, Scott has received awards for several books, including those focused on the Unified Process, agile software development, Unified Modeling Language, and development based on the CMM (Capability Maturity Model). A widely recognized expert on Agile Process, he is a regular speaker at international IT conferences and a senior contributing editor for Dr. Dobb&gt; '&gt; s Journal. Scott also writes the Agile Software Development at Scale blog on IBM DeveloperWorks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Prior to working for IBM, Scott led the development of several software processes, including Agile Modeling (AM), Agile Data (AD), Enterprise Unified Process (EUP), and Agile Unified Process (AUP). He holds a BSC in computer science and a MS in information science from the University of Toronto.
