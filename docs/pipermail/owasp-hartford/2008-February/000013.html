<PRE>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a worldwide free and
open community focused on improving the security of application software.
Our mission is to make application security &quot;visible,&quot; so that people and
organizations can make informed decisions about application security risks.
The meeting will be held on Thursday, February 28th at the Hartford, 690
Asylum Street, Hartford CT 06115 in the Tower Building, Atrium Conference
Room and start promptly at 5:30 pm. Parking is available in our ramp garage.

to attending. The results will be shared and will help us in determining
future topics.

Many have inquired whether there would be food and beverages served to which
I can positively respond with a yes! The folks over at Ounce Labs
(<A HREF="http://www.ouncelabs.com">http://www.ouncelabs.com</A>) has generously agreed to sponsor pizza and drinks
for this event. If you aren't familar with Ounce Labs, their solutions
enable organizations to identify, prioritize and eliminate business risk to
the enterprise caused by software security vulnerabilities. Ounce analyzes
application source code to provide the most complete and accurate analysis
of application vulnerabilities and their relative priorities, enabling
business users and IT professionals to optimize their resources on resolving
the most critical issues. With Ounce Labs, organizations strengthen
application security, protect confidential information and verify compliance
with internal policies as well as industry regulations such as PCI, FISMA,
and Sarbanes-Oxley, and best practices including the OWASP Top 10.

For those who have certifications such as CISSP, CISA, CISM or others. This
meeting counts as continuing education and there will be a special signup
sheet upon arrival. If you haven't already subscribed to the chapter mailing
