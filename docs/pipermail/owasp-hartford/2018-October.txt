As part of our Academic initiative to partner with local
colleges/universities, Fairfield University CISO Bill Reyor, has invited
OWASP to Fairfield University this coming Friday Oct 12 @ 11am at the
Fairfield University DiMenna-Nyselius Library on 5171, 1073 N Benson Rd,
Fairfield, ct, 06824.

This session is oriented toward college students and new college graduates
exploring computer security ("cybersecurity") as a career path. We plan to
discuss:

*The State of Computer Security Employment and need for diversity to solve
tomorrow's security challenges (It's not all Computer Science)
*Profiles of Computer Security Career Paths
*The Day in the Life of a Security Professional, by your truly.
*The need for Business, Medical, and Technology undergraduates and
graduates to work together as security becomes an increasingly
interdisciplinary challenge

*Call to action:*
For area security professionals with open reqs for new/college-hires,
please reach out in advance or connect me with your HR point of contact so
that we can share opportunities with students that attend and are actively
looking for local opportunities.
