Subject: [OWASP Hartford] OWASP Boston April 3rd Meeting: Go Fast. Be
 Secure: Effectively Govern the Use of Open Source Components Throughout the
 SDLC
Message-ID: <F0F009F1537F7948B0D9499C2FE5C5351C135F31@G6W2494.americas.hpqcorp.net>

*  Open Source Software (OSS) Component supply chain complexities and realities. Open source is constantly changing and knowing the version in your software, as well as the current version history of the component (how do you show an auditor you are using a current version) is important.
*  Open Source Consumption Patterns from the Central Repository. Which versions are the most popular can tell you which versions are the most stable, useful, secure etc.
*  OWASP Top 10 (A9) - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities. To decide on the risk of OSS components with vulnerabilities, you need to know the vulnerabilities, their severity and which components they occur in as well as where in the code dependency tree they are.
*  OSS Security, Quality and License policies must be woven into the development process. Knowing the number and type of open source licenses in your software can be important to the legal standing of your code and if it conflicts with any corporate standards. The licensing is also important in order to know the restrictions on changing the software.
*  OSS Component Policy Examples
*  Example Application Compositions Reports
*  Example Use cases IDE, CI, repository, production applications
*  Discussion

About Sonatype:

The company has been a pioneer in component-based software development since its founding by Jason van Zyl, the creator of the Apache Maven build management system and the Central Repository.

Agenda:


8:30    Coffee ? courtesy IBM, Ilantus

8:50    Business Meeting:  Is a rename in order?
IBM has reorganized and moved the security products out of the Tivoli brand.  The new brand is IBM Security.

9:10    NSTIC & Identity Ecosystem Overview
George Dobbs, Enterprise Architect, Mass Mutual Financial Group
George is currently working on customer facing identity and access control solutions and is a member of the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group.
This presentation is about the United States? effort to encourage the development of the national strategy for trusted identities in cyberspace.  George will provide a short introduction and suggest a picture of a possible future state.

10:00   Identity Brokerage: beyond point-to-point.  Ilantus Technologies
Anurag Rai, Vice President - Consulting & Advisory Services and
Kevin McNally- Director of Sales
Anurag is an advisor in Information Security, Compliance, Audit and Risk Management space working with clients in architecture, design, implementation.  He is responsible for all the consulting and advisory activities in the North American region.
Kevin has twenty plus years of enterprise software experience at both industry-leading enterprise software companies and several early stage start-ups.
This presentation is about scaling up federation.  If a company wants to federate with many customers and the customers in turn want to federate with other companies, the default point-to-point pattern becomes an N2 scaling problem.  Are there ways to make the management of federation more scalable?


10:50   Break (20 minutes)

11:10   Provisioning strategies for Cloud Applications
Sridhar Muppidi, Chief Architect, IBM Security Solutions
Sridhar Muppidi is a Senior Security Architect with IBM Security Systems. Sridhar has been covering identity and access management, fined grained authorization, web services security, SOA, Data and Endpoint security for over a decade.
This is about the cloud space, where the service vendor has an identity store and corporate security needs to keep track of who is enrolled.   What are the ways that the accounts can be enrolled, periodically certified and eventually disabled or un-enrolled? We will discuss a maturity model approach to help enterprises govern their cloud-based applications, spanning user lifecycle management, access governance, federation and risk-based authentication.
