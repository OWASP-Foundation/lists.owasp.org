DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en-US:Gene Kim has been studying high-performing IT or
 ganizations since 1999.  He is the author of the highly acclaimed “Visib
 le Ops Handbook\,” “The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT\, DevOps\, a
 nd Helping Your Business Win\,” and founder of Tripwire\, Inc.\n\nHe wil
 l be presenting his findings from an ongoing study of how high-performing 
 IT organizations simultaneously deliver stellar service levels and deliver
  fast flow of new features into the production environment.  To successful
 ly deliver against what on the surface appear to be conflicting objectives
 \, (i.e. preserving service levels while introducing significant amounts o
 f change into production)\, requires creating a highly-coordinated collect
 ion of teams where Development\, QA\, IT Operations\, as well as Product M
 anagement and Information Security genuinely work together to solve busine
 ss objectives.\n\nGene will describe what successful transformations look 
 like\, and how those transformations were achieved from a software develop
 ment and service operations perspective.  He will draw upon fourteen years
  of research of high-performing IT organizations\, as well as work he's do
 ne since 2008 to help some of the largest Internet companies increase feat
 ure flow and production stability through applications of DevOps principle
 s.\n\n\nBiography\n\nGene Kim is a multiple award winning CTO\, researcher
  and author.  He was founder and CTO of Tripwire for 13 years. He has writ
 ten three books\, including “The Visible Ops Handbook” and “The Phoe
 nix Project: A Novel About IT\, DevOps\, and Helping Your Business Win."  
 Gene is a huge fan of IT operations\, and how it can enable developers to 
 maximize throughput of features from “code complete” to “in producti
 on\,” without causing chaos and disruption to the IT environment.  He ha
 s worked with some of the top Internet companies on improving deployment f
 low and increasing the rigor around IT operational processes. In 2007\, Co
 mputerWorld added Gene to the “40 Innovative IT People Under The Age Of 
 40” list\, and was given the Outstanding Alumnus Award by the Department
  of Computer Sciences at Purdue University for achievement and leadership 
 in the profession.\n\nRaffle\n\nWe will be raffling off two copies of Gene
 ’s books along with other prizes (TBD). One copy of his book will automa
 tically go to the person who forwards this calendar invite to the most ind
 ividuals that generate the most attendance ☺\n\nAbout OWASP\n\nThe Open 
 Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a 501(c)(3) worldwide not-for-
 profit charitable organization focused on improving the security of softwa
 re. Our mission is to make software security visible\, so that individuals
  and organizations worldwide can make informed decisions about true softwa
 re security risks.\n\n\n  ________________________________\nThis communica
