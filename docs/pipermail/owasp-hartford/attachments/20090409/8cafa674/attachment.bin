DESCRIPTION:The Hartford Chapter of OWASP is pleased to announce Scott Ambl
 er as our first speaker of the year. This event is 100% free to attend. Se
 ating is limited. We will be starting promptly at 4pm…\N\NAgility and Se
 curity: Two Great Tastes Which Go Great Together\N\NSecurity is usually an
  afterthought on software development projects\, regardless of the paradig
 m being followed\, but it doesn't have to be this way. Traditional approac
 hes would have you add a lot of additional bureaucracy to your process and
  the agile extremists will tell you to write up some stories on index card
 s. Good luck with those strategies. Disciplined agile teams\, particularly
  those working at scale\, have discovered ways to address enterprise issue
 s such as security in effective manners which gets the job done without un
 necessary bureaucracy\, albeit with more sophisticated tools than a stack 
 of index cards. This presentation overviews the Agile Process Maturity Mod
 el (APMM)\, what it means to scale agile approaches to meet your real-worl
 d needs\, and strategies for addressing security concerns in a disciplined
  agile manner.\NScott W. Ambler is the Practice Leader for Agile Developme
 nt at IBM Corporation. He works in the IBM Methods group developing proces
 s materials and travels the world helping clients to understand and adopt 
 software processes that are right for them. A prolific author\, Scott has 
 received awards for several books\, including those focused on the Unified
  Process\, agile software development\, Unified Modeling Language\, and de
 velopment based on the CMM (Capability Maturity Model). A widely recognize
 d expert on Agile Process\, he is a regular speaker at international IT co
 nferences and a senior contributing editor for Dr. Dobb’s Journal. Scott
  also writes the Agile Software Development at Scale blog on IBM Developer
 Works.\N\NPrior to working for IBM\, Scott led the development of several 
 software processes\, including Agile Modeling (AM)\, Agile Data (AD)\, Ent
 erprise Unified Process (EUP)\, and Agile Unified Process (AUP). He holds 
 a BSC in computer science and a MS in information science from the Univers
 ity of Toronto. \N
