DESCRIPTION:\NWeb applications are frequently the Achilles heel of a networ
 k. A Web application has to be accessible to all of your customers and bus
 iness partners. Ports 80 and 443 have to be open to the world to provide u
 biquitous access to the Web application and therefore traditional protecti
 on mechanisms such as firewalls and SSL provide little security protection
 . On the other hand\, a full-featured Web application is connected to a co
 rporation's database storing customer information. In short: A Web applica
 tion is the shortest path for an attacker to take to reach the organizatio
 n's crown jewels. Securing Web applications is critical and not easy. \N\N
 This joint meeting will introduce the challenges faced in developing secur
 e web applications and how to discover from an audit perspective\, any def
 iciencies found. You will learn about a set of process that can be put int
 o place to allow an auditor to focus on the risk proposition and to valida
 te defenses through automation of audit checklists.\N\NISACA is a leading 
 global provider of knowledge\, certifications\, community\, advocacy and e
 ducation on information systems (IS) assurance and security\, enterprise g
 overnance of IT\, and IT-related risk and compliance.\N\NThe Open Web Appl
 ication Security Project (OWASP) is a worldwide free and open community fo
 cused on improving the security of application software. Our mission is to
  make application security "visible\," so that people and organizations ca
 n make informed decisions about application security risks. Everyone is fr
 ee to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available under a 
 free and open software license. \N\NTo receive future invites\, please sub
 scribe to our mailing list at: https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/ow
 asp-hartford\N\NNon-Hartford employees are encouraged to park in the Tower
  Building: Ramp Garage.  The updated agenda will be posted here: http://ww
