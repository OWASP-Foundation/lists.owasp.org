DESCRIPTION:While Java offers an efficient framework for developing and dep
 loying enterprise and Web 2.0 server or client-side applications\, it also
  presents many risks. Attacks against Java applications come from many dif
 ferent angles— whether a rogue employee steals class files containing cr
 itical Intellectual Property\, a thick client is reverse engineered to gai
 n visibility into business logic\, or a high price tag application is pira
 ted. These attacks are unfortunately easy to carry out given that Java\, b
 eing an interpreted language\, contains program metadata which reveals the
  inner workings of the application. In fact\, attackers often use attack t
 ools such as decompilers capable of producing source code from the metadat
 a contained Java class files. Fortunately\, there are numerous ways to foi
 l reverse engineering and tampering of Java applications including: contro
 l flow obfuscation\, class encryption\, symbol renaming\, code signing\, a
 nd string encryption. However\, because of other vulnerabilities such as J
 ava runtime hijacking\, some of these protection technologies are easy to 
 circumvent. Therefore when considering homegrown or commercial solutions i
 t is important to have a holistic perspective on security. In this session
  we will consider and demonstrate some of the vulnerabilities and risks al
 ong with protection tools to pack when assessing or implementing Java appl
 ication security. \N\NSpeaker\N\NMike Dulaney joined Arxan in 2003 as a So
 ftware Security Analyst participating in and managing government-funded re
 search studies to measure the effectiveness of software security. Mr. Dula
 ney is now part of Arxan’s commercial sales organization as a Security A
 rchitect\, a role in which he has contributed in a variety of functional a
 reas— Technical Pre-Sales\, Technical Support\, Management\, Rapid Proto
 typing\, Security Forensics\, and Threat Modeling. Previously\, Mr. Dulane
 y performed application security research and development throughout all s
 tages of the application security lifecycle. He also helped bootstrap Arxa
 n’s GuardIT product by designing and developing product security feature
 s and playing a key role in enabling support for new compilers and languag
 es. Mr. Dulaney earned a B.S. in Computer Science from Purdue University b
 efore completing post-graduate coursework at Purdue’s Krannert Graduate 
 School of Management. \N\N\N\N\N
