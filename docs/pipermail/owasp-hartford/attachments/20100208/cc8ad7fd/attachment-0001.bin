DESCRIPTION:Data fuels 21st century business and society.  Thanks to the ra
 pid pace of innovation and widespread adoption of information technologies
 \, data has become both a strategic asset and a potentially crippling liab
 ility.  As consumers grow increasingly concerned about the stewardship of 
 their data\, policymakers\, academics and advocates around the world are q
 uestioning boundaries and considering risks: What is private and what is n
 ot?  How should organizations explain what they’re doing with data?  Wha
 t should happen when data is stolen or misused?  And\, in an era of global
 ization\, how do we manage the diverse social and legal expectations? \N\N
  These questions are urgent in the current business climate where trust in
  our most basic institutions has been eroded.  As organizations growing te
 nsion between innovation\, privacy and security\, they are discovering tha
 t appropriate use and protection of data has broad impact on their reputat
 ions and bottom lines—a new\, holistic ethos of data environmentalism is
  necessary.  \N\NEarlier this year\, the International Association of Priv
 acy Professionals undertook the first benchmark study of the profession it
  represents—over 95% of respondents identified collaboration with inform
 ation security professionals as critical to their success.  The viability 
 of data environmentalism hinges heavily on human capital.  The time is rig
 ht for a robust conversation about how the privacy and security profession
 s can better collaborate and assure trust in our data-driven world.\N\NJ. 
 Trevor Hughes is the Executive Director of the International Association o
 f Privacy Professionals (IAPP).  In this role\, Hughes leads the world’s
  largest association of privacy professionals.  \N\NHughes has provided te
 stimony before the US House Commerce Committee\, the US Senate Commerce Co
 mmittee\, the FTC\, the Home Affairs Committee of the British Parliament\,
  and the EU Parliament on issues of privacy\, surveillance\, spam and priv
 acy sensitive technologies.  He is a member of the first class of Certifie
 d Information Privacy Professionals (CIPP) and recently completed\, with c
 o-author Reed Freeman\, “Privacy Law in Marketing”\, published by Wolt
 ers Kluwer.\N\NHughes is an adjunct professor at the University of Maine S
 chool of Law and has lectured at Boston College\, Georgetown University\, 
 and Northeastern University.  A native of Canada\, Hughes holds a BA in po
 litical science from the University of Massachusetts and a Juris Doctorate
  from the University of Maine.\N\NThe Open Web Application Security Projec
 t (OWASP) is a worldwide free and open community focused on improving the

 ity "visible\," so that people and organizations can make informed decisio
 ns about application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OW
