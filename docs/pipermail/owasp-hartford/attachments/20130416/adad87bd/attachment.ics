DESCRIPTION;LANGUAGE=en-US:\nAgenda:\n\n\n8:30    Coffee – courtesy IBM\,
  Ilantus\n\n8:50    Business Meeting:  Is a rename in order?\nIBM has reor
 ganized and moved the security products out of the Tivoli brand.  The new 
 brand is IBM Security.\n\n9:10    NSTIC & Identity Ecosystem Overview\nGeo
 rge Dobbs\, Enterprise Architect\, Mass Mutual Financial Group\nGeorge is 
 currently working on customer facing identity and access control solutions
  and is a member of the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group.\nThis presentat
 ion is about the United States’ effort to encourage the development of t
 he national strategy for trusted identities in cyberspace.  George will pr
 ovide a short introduction and suggest a picture of a possible future stat
 e.\n\n10:00   Identity Brokerage: beyond point-to-point.  Ilantus Technolo
 gies\nAnurag Rai\, Vice President - Consulting & Advisory Services and\nKe
 vin McNally- Director of Sales\nAnurag is an advisor in Information Securi
 ty\, Compliance\, Audit and Risk Management space working with clients in 
 architecture\, design\, implementation.  He is responsible for all the con
 sulting and advisory activities in the North American region.\nKevin has t
 wenty plus years of enterprise software experience at both industry-leadin
 g enterprise software companies and several early stage start-ups.\nThis p
 resentation is about scaling up federation.  If a company wants to federat
 e with many customers and the customers in turn want to federate with othe
 r companies\, the default point-to-point pattern becomes an N2 scaling pro
 blem.  Are there ways to make the management of federation more scalable?\
 n\n\n10:50   Break (20 minutes)\n\n11:10   Provisioning strategies for Clo
 ud Applications\nSridhar Muppidi\, Chief Architect\, IBM Security Solution
 s\nSridhar Muppidi is a Senior Security Architect with IBM Security System
 s. Sridhar has been covering identity and access management\, fined graine
 d authorization\, web services security\, SOA\, Data and Endpoint security
  for over a decade.\nThis is about the cloud space\, where the service ven
 dor has an identity store and corporate security needs to keep track of wh
 o is enrolled.   What are the ways that the accounts can be enrolled\, per
 iodically certified and eventually disabled or un-enrolled? We will discus
 s a maturity model approach to help enterprises govern their cloud-based a
 pplications\, spanning user lifecycle management\, access governance\, fed
 eration and risk-based authentication.\n\n\n
