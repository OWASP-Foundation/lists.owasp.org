DESCRIPTION:\NThe Open Web Application Security Project will be holding its
  next meeting on Wednesday September 24th at The Hartford\, Tower Building
 \, Atrium Conference Room. We will have two great speakers: Nick Selby\, I
 ndustry Analyst from the 451 Group along with Andy Stone of Accenture. \N\
 NAndy will be speaking on the topic of: Improve Security by Removing It fr
 om Applications\N\NThe next evolutionary advancement in securing custom ap
 plications will involve removing security code from the application packag
 e. Application security has evolved from almost nonexistent to include sec
 urity focused coding practices and functions.  Although applications will 
 continue to need secure coding practices such as failing to a\Nsecure mode
  and secure defaults\, security functions such as authentication and autho
 rization have no place in the application package.  Abstraction of these f
 unctions can result in improved security and reduced cost of application d
 evelopment.\N\NThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a worl
 dwide free and open community focused on improving the security of applica
 tion software. Our mission is to make application security "visible\," so 
 that people and organizations can make informed decisions about applicatio
 n security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our 
 materials are available under a free and open software license. \N\NThe de
 tailed agenda is available at: http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hartford\N\N
 Door Prizes are sponsored by Ironkey (http://www.ironkey.com) The world's 
 most secure Flash drive. Refreshments will be servedâ€¦\N\NTo receive futu
