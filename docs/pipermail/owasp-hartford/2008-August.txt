Subject: [Owasp-hartford] IASA NY - Another meeting that you might be
	interested in
Message-ID: <9C557D8C6864CA438EF362318A3DF6D501F62ABB@AD1HFDEXC306.ad1.prod>

Eric Evans (Author or the book "Domain Driven Design") will be
presenting at the Microsoft office in NYC on September 3rd at 7pm.
Please reply directly to Vladimir Gitlevich (vlad at xaoc.com) if
interested in attending. His last session was filled beyond capacity and
they had to turn away people.

This time, we are going to talk about  Context Mapping. It is the
subject of Chapter 14 of Eric Evans' book "Domain-Driven Design". 
Eric kindly gave me permission to use a segment of his class on
Strategic Design, so after a brief introduction we will go into that 
segment, which should keep us both busy and entertained throughout the
evening.
