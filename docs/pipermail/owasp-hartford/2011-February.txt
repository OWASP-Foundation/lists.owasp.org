Rob Cheyne, CEO of Safelight Security - 

 

Security Leadership series: Delivering a successful security
presentation

Presentation and training skills are critical in any field, but are
especially important for security.  OWASP participants consist of
current and future information security leaders who absolutely must be
able to effectively communicate security topics to others in their
organizations.

 

Anyone can be an effective presenter, but few people take the time to
hone this critical skill.  Rob Cheyne, CEO, Safelight Security, will
present a special train-the-trainer session where he will divulge the
secrets of a successful security or technical presentation.  Come and
learn how to move beyond "death by powerpoint", and be ready to
challenge everything you know about giving a technical presentation.

 

Part 1 (6:30-7pm):

Rob will cover a basic information security topic using traditional
presentation and training methods and then he will re-teach the same
topic using modern accelerated learning techniques.  He's going to keep
the topic a secret until you get there, so you'll have to show up to see
what it is.  Hint: the topic itself is not the point.

 

Part 2 (7-9pm):

Accelerated learning debrief. Rob will teach you how to be a more
effective presenter by breaking down the key elements of a successful
presentation or training.  OWASP participants can directly use these
techniques to make their own security and technical presentations more
effective.   He will break down his security topic from part 1 and
explain the presentation and training techniques one by one.  This will
be like having the magician pull a rabbit out of the hat and then
explain in detail how he did the trick.

 

This is a special, pre-RSA warm-up talk that may never be repeated. If
you've ever struggled to give an effective technical presentation,
please make every effort to attend.  You will get the most value from
this talk if you can show up early to participate in both parts 1 and 2.
Please show up ready to have some fun and participate fully in an
interactive and entertaining discussion.  And there will be pizza.  What
more could you ask for?  :-)

 

FYI - it's possible (but not guaranteed) that a brave volunteer will be
chosen to present an arbitrary 5-minute technical topic that they are
familiar with for demonstration purposes.
