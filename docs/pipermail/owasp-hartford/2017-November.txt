Wanted to share the presentation and video from our BSidesCT 2017 talk for
folks either looking to get into the security space, or pivoting to a
different security career path. Thanks again to the BSides organizers for
hosting us! and to the local security community for being open to us
interviewing them leading up to the talk.

*OWASP CT Mentorship Initiative*
We did get a number of folks reaching out to us after the talk to be local
security mentor, as well as folks interested in connecting with a mentor.
If you're interested in participating as a mentor and/or mentee, or helping
with our mentorship initiative in general, please reach out via email and
let me know.


Title: Accelerating and Pivoting your Security Career

Abstract: This talk is for folks either trying to identify paths into the
InfoSEC space, and for experienced security professionals trying to pivot
and jump start alternative security career paths. We'll map out different
career paths and identify key skills for success, discuss how to build
them, and resources you can take advantage of locally here in CT.


Cheers,

Alvin Fong
