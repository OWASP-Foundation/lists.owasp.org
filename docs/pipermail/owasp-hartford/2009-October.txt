*	The economics of free events: The economy has had an impact on
many training budgets where the opportunity to attend paid conferences
has been reduced to almost zero, so IT employees who care about
networking and learning will gravitate towards local events that are low
cost or even free. Many IT professionals haven't put much thought into
the economics behind free conferences and need to understand the
importance of how these events happen. Enterprises provide meeting
facilities for events and sponsors cover the cost of food and beverages.
The reason they invest in free events is to gain exposure to an
audience. The more the attendees, the more vendors want to sponsor free
events. With this thought in mind, I am asking that you not only
consider attending OWASP meetings but also take time out of your busy
schedule and share the invites with others. This will go a long way to
helping bring even more free educational opportunities to you.

*	Membership: The OWASP model is like public television and
depends on the generous support of both organizations and individuals
alike. Please consider supporting the cause by joining.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  


How do I respond to your postings?
The most effective way is to copy the job description and send an
updated resume- I mention "updated" because although you sent a resume
to me in the past, the newer version you are sending will reflect the
technologies and responsibilities specific to THAT PARTICULAR JOB. 
Hint: It doesn't hurt to paraphrase the job description into your
resume- make it obvious that you have done the work they are asking for.
Please go through the position description and job requirements item y
item to demonstrate the fit and email it back to me.
For example, if they say they want someone with two years of xyz and you
have three years, write it. If the job is to manage 6 people in the
development of such and such and you have three years doing it managing
a staff of 14, write it and send it back to me.


Since I just joined, Is there a way to access the job postings that are
currently open?
In addition to the emails that you are getting or starting to 
receive, you can access job postings by clicking on `messages" on the
left side of the yahoo group page.

TO FIND OUT ABOUT OTHER OPEN POSITIONS, CHECK THE MESSAGES SECTION - FOR
JOB POSTINGS THAT WERE DISTRIBUTED PRIOR TO YOU JOINING

How long should I wait to hear back after submitting my resume?
Every resume/every email gets my attention- it is not unusual to 
expect a 3-5-business day turnaround.

Do any of the other members have access to email address or my
information?
Absolutely not! This group was set up so that all members are 
anonymous to each other In addition there is no "chat" room for 
members. The group is designed so postings come from my desk.

SEARCHQUEEN-unsubscribe at yahoogroups.com

Can my friends join your group?
Absolutely- they can log on the same way you did or just email me

I actually sent her a message off list  after the first email asking  
her to stop with the high priority thing, since if you're not directly  
mailing something to someone it can't be that high priority, but  
apparently recruiters are allowed to be rude.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

While Java offers an efficient framework for developing and deploying enterprise and Web 2.0 server or client-side applications, it also presents many risks. Attacks against Java applications come from many different angles- whether a rogue employee steals class files containing critical Intellectual Property, a thick client is reverse engineered to gain visibility into business logic, or a high price tag application is pirated. These attacks are unfortunately easy to carry out given that Java, being an interpreted language, contains program metadata which reveals the inner workings of the application. In fact, attackers often use attack tools such as decompilers capable of producing source code from the metadata contained Java class files. Fortunately, there are numerous ways to foil reverse engineering and tampering of Java applications including: control flow obfuscation, class encryption, symbol renaming, code signing, and string encryption. However, because of other vulnerabilities such as Java runtime hijacking, some of these protection technologies are easy to circumvent. Therefore when considering homegrown or commercial solutions it is important to have a holistic perspective on security. In this session we will consider and demonstrate some of the vulnerabilities and risks along with protection tools to pack when assessing or implementing Java application security.
