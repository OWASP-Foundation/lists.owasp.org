Greetings,

     We are holding a compsec conference in Meriden Connecticut on June 11,
2011, and I am hoping your organization can attend. I'm sure information at
this event will help with future endeavors. If any of your group would like
to speak or attend the event please feel free to contact me at the
infomation below.

It will be two security conferences which will run directly back to back.
The first will be a Security BSides event which is free to anyone wishing to
attend (they just need to preregister which can be done here:
http://bsidesct.eventbrite.com/ . The second event we?re calling
eXconference or eXcon for short, registration for eXcon is 50.00 dollars
which can be done by visiting http://excon.eventbrite.com/

What are Security Bsides?

Security BSides are a community driven events intended to expand the scope
of conversation far beyond the traditional security lecture or presentation.
This is intended to be an intimate environment that encourages collaboration
(like how most hackerspaces work) it?s an intense event with lots of demos,
interaction, and participation. It?s where conversations for the
next-big-thing are happening. BsidesCT will also feature a network king of
the hill challenge ? where participants can try their skill at penetrating
our local test systems. If you are interested in speaking or presenting at
this event please see our call for papers. You can read more about security
BSides at http://www.securitybsides.com .

What is eXcon?

eXcon aims to be a cutting edge security conference presented by
Ex-Military, Ex-Secret Service, Ex-CIA, Ex-Cons, along with some of the
brightest and most recognizable pen testers, programmers, and systems
experts. Tracks will include demos of social engineering, digital tracking,
exploit development and implementation, and war stories. eXcon will feature
a lockpicking & hackerspace village (email excon at nesit.net for more info)

Greetings,
               I wanted to extend an invitation to the OWASP Hartford
chapter to BsidesCT happening June 11th. For those not aware, security
B-sides are infosec events free to the attendee that consist of high quality
workshops and presentations. We currently have a line up of about six
presenters that are covering topics including Pentesting, mobile malware,
and secure communication using ZRTP. However, we're currently seeking more
high quality presentations and have an open CFP page at
http://www.nesit.net/bsidesct-call-for-papers/ .

Also for organizations looking to increase awareness about about there
organization, service, or product we still have many opportunities for
sponsorship, for more information regarding sponsorship call or contact me
directly.

For information regarding Bsides, or BsidesCT please see
