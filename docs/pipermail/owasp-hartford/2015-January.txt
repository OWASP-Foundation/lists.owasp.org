Happy Holidays.

I wanted to make you aware of a movie coming out on January 16th titled: Blackhat.  My radical idea for each and every OWASP member is to consider encouraging a business executive to attend. Using entertainment as a tool to educate users on information security could be very powerful. Unlike, other "hacker" movies, this one is actually credible in nature as a few current and former members of the OWASP board served in an advisory capacity.

Here is the trailer on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CA95Bzpy7s

The New York City chapter is holding a special session for its members. I am game to explore something similar for Hartford if there is interest...

...just be careful with the details. The ads that are coming out are (as
noted by Dan Tentler, below) are completely bogus with the password
cracking advice:

IMO, this is a good opportunity to educate both your boss about InfoSec and
the "unwashed masses" about relying on sound security advice from Hollywood.

Just wanted to extend this to the local OWASP chapter.  Nutmeg Infosec is a
meetup I started to bring InfoSec pros and other interested parties
together for an evening off talks/demos/discussions around the topic.  Feel
free to share with the group.  We are currently holding them at NESIT, Inc
in Meriden, CT.  It is a local hackerspace that usually holds public nights
on Mondays and Wednesdays.  We are looking to move the meetup around so if
anyone would like to host/sponsor it, they can let me know.

This is a great opportunity to network with other Security folks as well as
those who are interested in getting into the field.  My personal goal is to
expand the security community in CT because I know you are out there and
the only way you succeed at this game is by learning from more than just a
book or an online training course!

The next one is 1/28 @ Nesit -
http://www.meetup.com/Nutmeg-InfoSec/events/219239031/ for details!

Remember things like this can also apply to your continuing education
credits, though you have to track it yourself.
