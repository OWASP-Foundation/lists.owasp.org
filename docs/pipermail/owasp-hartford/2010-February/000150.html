MCLEAN, Feb. 10 /OWASP Development Guide Project
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Guide_Project">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Guide_Project</A>&gt; / -- After
many months of planning and preparation, the OWASP Development Guide
project announced today that it is ready to begin work on the next
revision of the Guide, and that that the project is looking for
volunteers to do the work, both individuals and organizations. 
 
The OWASP Development Guide is aimed at architects, developers,
consultants and auditors and is a comprehensive manual for designing,
developing and deploying secure web applications. The original OWASP
Development Guide has become a staple diet for many web security
professionals. Since 2002, the initial version was downloaded over 2
million times. Today, the Development Guide is referenced by many
leading government, financial, and corporate standards and is the Gold
standard for Web Application and Web Service security.
 
The next version of the OWASP Development Guide will be in effect the
detailed design guide for the requirements of the OWASP Application
Security Verification Standard (ASVS), which can be found here:
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS</A>&gt; . Key features of the next Guide
will include use of the new OWASP common numbering scheme. The new
numbering scheme will be common across OWASP Guides and References, more
information can be found here:
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering</A>&gt; . Additional key
features will be the inclusion of worksheets and checklists, such as the
sample input validation worksheet which can be found here:
