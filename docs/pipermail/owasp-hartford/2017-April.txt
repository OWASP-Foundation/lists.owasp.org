Sharing for awareness -

When: Wed, Apr 26, 2017, 6:30pm-9-pm
Where: MakeHartford, 30 Arbor St, Hartford, CT

We've got a new team working on putting together a security / pen testing
lab and security learning environment here in CT.  The goal is to have a
place where we can create and share security and pen testing tips and
tricks with our members, as well as using the lab as a means to bolster our
outreach efforts to the colleges in the area.

We're going to use this initial session to explore the MakeHartford space
and start building up that lab. If you're interested, we would love to see
you at this session. Otherwise, shoot me an email and i'll keep you posted
on working group meetings moving forward.

Thanks to the current volunteer team and Steve Yanicke @MakeHartford:

Hello OWASP-CT,

As Alvin wrote on Monday, we've got a new team working on putting together a security / pen testing lab and security learning environment here in CT.? The goal is to have a place where we can create and share security and pen testing tips and tricks with our members, as well as using the lab as a means to bolster our outreach efforts to the colleges in the area.

At this point we have:

  - A slack page setup for ongoing discussions and project tracking?
          https://owasp-ct.slack.com

  - A potential home for our lab environment (initial setup 4.26.2017)
          http://www.makehartford.com/

  - An OWASP Security Shepherd installation in the works on Virtual Village
          http://virtualvillage.cloud
          https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Security_Shepherd

  - A bunch of to-dos for identifying resources, tools, testing environments, training, and general education resources

  - Plans to build relationships with higher education groups like the UCONN Cyber Security Club and other local educational groups

If you'd like to get involved, have ideas, time, or resources to share please sign up on the slack page, or send an email to Alvin Fong (alvin.fong at owasp.org).

Thanks,
/d
