> Web applications are frequently the Achilles heel of a network. A Web application has to be accessible to all of your customers and business partners. Ports 80 and 443 have to be open to the world to provide ubiquitous access to the Web application and therefore traditional protection mechanisms such as firewalls and SSL provide little security protection. On the other hand, a full-featured Web application is connected to a corporation's database storing customer information. In short: A Web application is the shortest path for an attacker to take to reach the organization's crown jewels. Securing Web applications is critical and not easy. 
> 
> This joint meeting will introduce the challenges faced in developing secure web applications and how to discover from an audit perspective, any deficiencies found. You will learn about a set of process that can be put into place to allow an auditor to focus on the risk proposition and to validate defenses through automation of audit checklists.
> 
> ISACA is a leading global provider of knowledge, certifications, community, advocacy and education on information systems (IS) assurance and security, enterprise governance of IT, and IT-related risk and compliance.
> 
> The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a worldwide free and open community focused on improving the security of application software. Our mission is to make application security "visible," so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available under a free and open software license.

The folks at Google have released some web app training, along with a
vulnerable web app sandbox to play in.  The tool is called Jarlsberg.
Anyone here take a look at it yet, and have an opinion about it?

The description (see below) sounds kinda sorta like OWASP's WebGoat,
except that the vulnerable app itself is written in Python.  Oh, and the
app is available on the web, as well as in source code (under Creative
Commons).

There's also an instructor's guide available at:

Subject: [OWASP-Hartford] TechCrunch Disrupt Hack Day - you're invited
Message-ID: <BFD50E79FBE23A4FB6BE93572A6FE28703CA7E13@AD1HFDEXC312.ad1.prod>

 
Dear Open Hack NYC Hackers, 

We wanted to let you know about an upcoming hack event in your part of
the world. Disrupt Hack Day ( http://disrupt.techcrunch.com/hackathon/
<http://yahoo.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=637a2a81ebeca7e59d9b233d
a&id=df443c804b&e=bfe773bed1>  ) takes place May 22-23 in New York City.
It will be a marathon session of hacking over Saturday night. The event
is free and is being held over the weekend before the TechCrunch Disrupt
conference.  Although this is not a Yahoo! event, Yahoo! hackers will be
participating and we hope you can join us. 

The Hack Day will mix 200 hackers, coders, developers and hardware
geeks, with a whole lot of Red Bull and pizza, then let it all ferment
overnight. Projects will be shown on stage on Sunday, and a variety of
awards will be given. If you finish and present a project you'll get
into the main Disrupt conference for free (saving you $3,000). All the
top hackers and projects will be covered by TechCrunch and other
attending media.

Participants can build whatever they'd like using publicly available
APIs. After a judging round on Sunday, the judges' favorite hacks will
present during Disrupt alongside top startups, in front of the entire
Disrupt event audience of 2,000 people on Wednesday, May 26. 

TechCrunch is a Technorati Top 5 blog that profiles startups, products
and websites, it has over 4.5 million RSS subscribers. TechCrunch
Disrupt is a three-day conference and startup competition. Attendees
will meet the people behind the new startups, new products and new
technologies driving disruption today. Startups go head to head to show
their stuff and impress the audience and a panel of experts over
multiple rounds of competition. Everyone gets stage time, but only one
startup will take home a $50,000 top prize.
