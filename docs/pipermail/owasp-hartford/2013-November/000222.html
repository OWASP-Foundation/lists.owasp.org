Date: Tuesday November 19, 2013
Time: 6:00 pm

Abstract

Technology changes relentlessly and it is hard to keep-up. All too often we lose sight of the bigger picture, not realizing that our skills have become obsolete or that the industry has changed until it is too late. For this meeting we will have a panel representing several major platforms including Microsoft, Java, Android, iOS, and HTML5/JavaScript. Each panelist will give a 15 minute update on their respective technology/platform. You will learn what's new, what has changed, and what is coming so you can better prepare yourself. After each panelist has presented, the discussion will shift to the relationships between the different technologies and take your questions. Come prepared with questions and ideas.
