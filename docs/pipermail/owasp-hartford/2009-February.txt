Message-ID: <193C2C0486582D4B9917A217C4DA91E0865690@AD1HFDEXC307.ad1.prod>

For those who are familiar with the Hartford, we will be holding the
next OWASP meeting in the Tower Building on the 22nd floor which will
provide us with even more space than our usual spot (Atrium Conference
Room). As usual, you should still park in our Tower Ramp Garage.

Cheers

So, here are some of the questions.
 
1. The notion of a relationship card seems applicable to consumer
scenarios such as AARP issuing cards to the eldery or AAA to automobile
drivers. Who within Higgins is making this technology known?
 
2. Usage of cards seems to be coupled to an otherwise disconnected
conversation. For example, I could see value in using cards within my
own industry vertical but don't know enough of my IT peers to make it
happen. Software vendors such as Sun, PingIdentity, IBM, Oracle, RSA do
however yet they have no incentive to wire any of us together to have a
conversation. Much of the technology in this space is sold point to
point where vendors would like introductions to others but don't think
they have a part in community formation. They are quick to point out in
handwaving fashion the notion of the NDA but if you really think about
it, what enterprise would have a strategy around cards, federated
identity, etc and want to not let the outside world know about it?
Federation is the antithesis to NDA so how do vendors get a clue?
 
3. Even if either of you don't know how to make the vendor breakthrough,
could you ask this question of others in industry forums such as at Sun
conferences on identity, Project Concordia, Liberty Alliance meetings,
etc?
 
4. What is the intersection between biometrics and cardspace? Anyone
noodling wiring biometrics into an identity selector?
 
5. Sun has shown leadership in terms of XACML where the ability to
represent more than just simple name/value pairs is possible within an
assertion. How should Cards involve to support XACML?
 
6. How should Information Cards in its various forms along with
Biometrics look like when stored in LDAP? Are there specific OIDs that
should be considered?
 
7. What should OWASP be noodling when it comes to incorporating Cards
into web applications? They already have guidance on passwords?
 
8. What should OWASP be noodling when it comes to incorporating
biometrics into web applications? Could Ramesh contribute a top ten
list?

James,
 
These are great, insightful questions.  See my initial responses inline
below at ###.  Thanks again for the opportunity to meet with your wonderful
group.

So, here are some of the questions.
 
1. The notion of a relationship card seems applicable to consumer scenarios
such as AARP issuing cards to the eldery or AAA to automobile drivers. Who
within Higgins is making this technology known?   ### Absolutely. You are
right.  There is great potential here. There are a number of us who are
spreading the message at conferences and in targeted outreaches. Are there
specific individuals you know with whom we should be talking?  An
introduction to the right person at AARP would be great.
 
2. Usage of cards seems to be coupled to an otherwise disconnected
conversation. For example, I could see value in using cards within my own
industry vertical but don't know enough of my IT peers to make it happen.
Software vendors such as Sun, PingIdentity, IBM, Oracle, RSA do however yet
they have no incentive to wire any of us together to have a conversation.
Much of the technology in this space is sold point to point where vendors
would like introductions to others but don't think they have a part in
community formation. They are quick to point out in handwaving fashion the
notion of the NDA but if you really think about it, what enterprise would
have a strategy around cards, federated identity, etc and want to not let
the outside world know about it? Federation is the antithesis to NDA so how
do vendors get a clue?   ### Building the Information Card ecosystem is a
major challenge, both the identity providers and the identity acceptors need
to adopt it. Realizing this, last June, a number of companies (now several
dozen including some of those named above) formed a consortium called The
Information Card Foundation to facilitate the adoption of Information Cards.
We are making progress, and expect to announce more commercial
offerings/adoptions by the time of the RSA conference. Things are still in
their early stages, and we appreciate any suggestions about how best to
leverage our activities. We have taken a multi-pronged bootstrap approach of
facilitating card issuers, and relying parties (card acceptors). We have
also been working to get support for Information Cards built into commercial
and open source software offerings so that it becomes easier for
organizations to start using Information Cards.
 
3. Even if either of you don't know how to make the vendor breakthrough,
could you ask this question of others in industry forums such as at Sun
conferences on identity, Project Concordia, Liberty Alliance meetings, etc?
### Though we have been making progress, we have clearly not reached the
critical mass of a breakthrough yet. Your question is timely: There is a
panel discussion at this year's RSA conference in April called "Fostering
Collaboration and Opportunities in Identity Management".  My presentation at
RSA is "Information Cards - What user-centric computing can do for your
enterprise."   This is a regular topic at Concordia meetings and Internet
Identity Workshop meetings, etc. What do you think would be a "Killer App"
for Information Cards?
 
 
4. What is the intersection between biometrics and cardspace? Anyone
noodling wiring biometrics into an identity selector?   ### The Information
Card model is consistent with multi-factor authentication including
biometrics. There is a place in the Higgins implementation to create
plug-ins for biometrics. We talk about it a lot, but I don't know of anyone
who has actually done it yet. Would someone in this group like to volunteer?
 
5. Sun has shown leadership in terms of XACML where the ability to represent
more than just simple name/value pairs is possible within an assertion. How
should Cards involve to support XACML?
 
6. How should Information Cards in its various forms along with Biometrics
look like when stored in LDAP? Are there specific OIDs that should be
considered?    
 
7. What should OWASP be noodling when it comes to incorporating Cards into
web applications? They already have guidance on passwords?   ### Think about
the potential for passing other types of information.  What types of
verified claims (verified information) would you like to have about people
who visit your web applications? What kinds of cool things could you do for
your users if they brought verified claims with them when they visited your
web applications?  If you knew that they were over 21, are there additional
services that you could provide?  If you knew they came to you with a higher
level of assurance about some aspect of their identity could you justify
giving them a discount?  If you knew what state they came from could you
provide them more targeted offerings and services (showing the snow blower
ad to the person from Maine and the water ski ad to the person from Florida
this time of year and not vice versa?)  Cards open up a whole new way of
thinking about user interaction.
 
8. What should OWASP be noodling when it comes to incorporating biometrics
into web applications? Could Ramesh contribute a top ten list?
