Subject: [Owasp-hartford] Welcome to the Hartford CT Chapter
Message-ID: <7E17878DC3BD7640949FBBE9F7FCABC66B8941@AD1HFDEXC306.ad1.prod>

I guess we should open this up for discussion. Since this is a new
chapter, we can be imaginative like an artist with a blank canvas. Any
creative mission statements? Ways to encourage more local participation?
Speakers you would like to see present? 

Our first meeting will have Dr. Gary McGraw, CTO of Cigital who is an
industry thought leader on software security. For those who aren't
familiar with this topic, check out one of his podcasts here:
http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/audio/download/itconversations-966.m
p3

To appeal to both our crack app security experts and those in web
development with limited security knowledge, the goal is to have a mix
of
case studies that demonstrate app security best practices and processes
at local companies along with demonstrations of web hacking techniques.
Any suggestions prior to the meeting are certainly welcome.

Whenever I attend user groups that occur during dinner time, I tend to
get very hungry and desire something to eat. Since, we haven't had our
first meeting yet, we have no budget to purchase snacks for attendees. I
was thinking that I would go out of pocket and purchase a couple of
cases of sodas and chips and have a donation jar where folks could throw
spare change to fund the next meeting. This would be left up to the
individual as to how much they would want to donate.

Other user group meetings that I have been to have charged $5 and
included pizza. Which approach do you prefer?

I like the "throw in $5 for pizza" idea best.  Anyway, pizza would be a bit
more substantial then chips.

Cheers,

May not have to worry about it after all as we may have an entity
interested in sponsoring food and beverages...

                        Welcome to OWASP
                        The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is
a worldwide free and open community focused on improving the security of
application software. Our mission is to make application security "visible,"
so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about
application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all
of our materials are available under an open source license. The OWASP
Foundation is a 501c3 not-for-profit charitable organization that ensures
the ongoing availability and support for our work.

                        Agenda: Thursday, Feb 28th 2008

                        Opening Remarks: 5:30 - 6:00 PM
                        James McGovern, Chapter Lead

                          a.. Overview of OWASP
                          b.. Survey Results
                          c.. Upcoming Speakers

                        How Web 2.0 has changed the landscape of Application
Security: 6:00 - 7:00 PM
                        Chenxi Wang, Principal Analyst at Forrester Research

                        Exploiting Online Games: 7:00 - 8:00 PM
                        Gary McGraw, CTO of Cigital



                        The talk, based on a book of the same title
(co-authored by Greg

                        Hoglund), exposes the inner workings of online game
security for all to see, drawing illustrations from MMORPGs such as World of
Warcraft to discuss:

                          a.. Why online games are a harbinger of software
security issues to come
                          b.. How millions of gamers have created billion
dollar virtual economies
                          c.. How game companies invade your privacy
                          d.. Why some gamers cheat
                          e.. Techniques for breaking onsite game security
                          f.. How to build a bot to play a game for you
                          g.. Methods for total conversion and advanced mods
                         Ultimately this talk is about security problems
associated with

                        advanced massively distributed software.  With
hundreds of thousands of interacting users, today's online games are a
bellwether of modern software yet to come.  The kinds of attack and defense
techniques described in this presentation are tomorrow's security techniques
on display today.
