Our next meeting will feature two great speakers who will talk about
code review and information systems logging. Our goal is to double the
amount of attendees for this meeting as we had for our kickoff. In order
for us to hit this goal, I will need for each member of this list to
forward the invite to ten other IT professionals you know...
