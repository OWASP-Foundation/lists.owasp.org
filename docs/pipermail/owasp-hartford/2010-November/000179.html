<PRE>I periodically circulate meeting notices from other chapters, but this
one deserves special attention. I cannot think of any future
opportunities better than this one in order to learn how to assess an
enterprise application than this one (paid or free). If anyone from the
Hartford area is interested in carpooling, please let me know...

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston Dec. 1 meeting

 

<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston</A>

 

Date - Wednesday December 1

 

Time - 6:30 p.m.

Main Topic - Application Architecture Security Assessment  - Second
session:

Presenter - Rob Cheyne, Safelight Security Advisors

In the December 1st session, Rob will conduct a sample architecture
assessment against a real-world system, and in the process, teach
participants how to conduct an architecture of their own.  Brave
volunteers will be welcome to share their own architectures and have
them reviewed. This is an opportunity to get free consulting that
typically costs thousands of dollars.  There is limited time, so not
every one will get chosen.  If you are interested in this, please
contact Rob Cheyne (<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-hartford">rcheyne at safelightsecurity.com</A>) directly.

Additional information:

Penetration testing is a common way to evaluate an application's
security.  Yet a comprehensive architecture and design assessment can
uncover critical security issues that often cost far less to resolve
early on in a project.  Many companies overlook this element of system
design.

Rob was one of a select few at security consulting company @stake who
regularly led and conducted full-blown enterprise-level architecture
assessments for Fortune 500 companies.  Drawing from his experience with
dozens of real-world architecture assessments over the past 12 years,
and his 20 years as a software developer, architect, and consultant, Rob
teaches students to challenge assumptions that frequently lead to
long-term security and reliability problems.
