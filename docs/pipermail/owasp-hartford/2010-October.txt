Subject: [OWASP Hartford] Free Event: Boston Application Security Conference
	(BASC)
Message-ID: <3D0018576183C3499481587FAE0BAAF808A9B270@ws-mailsvr.Virtusa.com>

Reserve on your calendars, Saturday November 20th for the Boston
Application Security Conference. While many of the presentations will
cover state-of-the-art application security concepts, the BASC is
intended to appeal to a wide-array of attendees. Application security
professionals, professional software developers, software quality
engineers, computer science students, and security software vendors
should be able to come to the BASC, learn, and hopefully enjoy
themselves at the same time.

 

This event will be held at the New England Research and Development
(NERD) campus in Cambridge (http://microsoftcambridge.com/Default.aspx).
This event is 100% free to attend and will have many great speakers. To
register, visit: http://basc2010.eventbrite.com/

 

Please consider sharing this event information with your coworkers....

 

Cheers

Subject: [OWASP Hartford] Thoughts for 2011
Message-ID: <3D0018576183C3499481587FAE0BAAF808BDDB69@ws-mailsvr.Virtusa.com>

I have failed in lining up a set of speakers for November, so it will be
quiet for the rest of the year. With that being said, I wanted to
brainstorm a few ideas with past OWASP attendees. Primarily, I am
thinking about a different format for next year. Over the last three
years, we have brought in a lot of great speakers who presented on a
variety of topics. This provided attendees with lots of breadth and
awareness but many are interested in exploring subjects much deeper.

 

So, for next year I am thinking about organizing an OWASP Training Day
(in the March timeframe) whereby we offer a full day's worth of training
at no additional costs for those that are current OWASP members (
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership). The focus of the training
would be the following:

 

1.       OWASP has many projects that I haven't had the opportunity to
discuss with others. The ability to learn how all of the OWASP projects
fits into an Enterprise's security ecosystem or in its Web Application
Development Lifecycle could be of immense benefit.

2.       Developers need to have a balanced view on both building secure
software as well as breaking insecure software. We will cover the
mandatory thought processes required of both audiences

3.       The ability to understand gaps in the current SDLC that each
member should be advocating being filled within their own organizations.
This will include throwing daggers at current practices around audit,
project management and compliance using a pragmatic approach. We need to
help others also appreciate not only the value of writing secure
applications, but to make the challenges we face "visible" to other
audiences

 

Of course, anything I put together will most certainly be more
information than could reasonably fit into a day, but it will allow us
all to collectively have both breadth and depth on the discipline of web
application security...
