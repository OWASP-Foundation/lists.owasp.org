<PRE>As you've likely heard, the AppSec DC CFP is winding down (closes 6/15)
and I have to say, we have not heard NEARLY enough from you OWASP
Project leaders!  AppSec Conferences are great places to get out the
word on the great OWASP project your working on.  AppSec DC is shaping
up to be a massive conference at the DC convention center with some
great talks submitted so far!

So what do you say leaders?  Lets show the world all the great work we
do and submit a CFP today!
Don't limit yourself to a 50 minute talk either.  We'll take submissions
for pannels or speed talks and will accept as the schedule permits!

There will be training courses on November 10th and 11th followed by
plenary sessions on the 12th and 13th with each day having at least
three tracks. AppSec DC may also have BOF, break out, or speed talks in
addition to the standard schedule depending on the submissions we
receive. 


To make a call for papers submission you must include : 

*	Presenter(s) name(s) 
*	Presenter(s) Email and Phone numbers 
*	Presenter(s) bio(s) 
*	Title 
*	Abstract 
*	Any supporting research/tools (will not be released outside of
CFP committee) 


Submission deadline is June 15th 2009 at 11:59 PM Eastern Standard Time.
Submit Proposals To mark.bristow(at)owasp.org with the subject line
APPSEC DC CFP SUBMISSION. It is very important you submit properly or
your proposal will not be considered (an automated filter is used). 


If you have additional questions about the CFP please read the FAQ
