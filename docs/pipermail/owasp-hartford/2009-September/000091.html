Program Speaker Agenda: 

8:25 &#8211; 9:45 &#8220;Software Security Requirements&#8221; by Paco Hope from Cigital, Inc. Security is one of those non-functional properties of software that is difficult to specify well in requirements or traditional use cases. If we're going to come full circle with software security, we must leverage the skills and processes in our QA department. In this engaging presentation, Paco discusses misuse/abuse cases, security best practices, architectural risk analysis, and attack patterns as techniques for exploring the security needs of a product. 

10:15 &#8211; 11:45 &#8220;The Top 25 Software Security Vulnerabilities&#8221; by Chris Wysopal from Veracode. In this presentation, Chris takes the QA test perspective on finding the top 25 application security vulnerabilities that are most likely to be exploited by attackers by combining static, dynamic and manual test techniques. By putting security vulnerabilities into context with other security issues, he will show what testing techniques are best suited for each category. The strengths and weaknesses of automated static and dynamic analysis as well as manual methods are examined. 

1:45 &#8211; 3:45 &#8220;Integrating Security Tools into the QA Test Process&#8221; by Danny Allen from IBM. An estimated 75 percent of applications are released with security vulnerabilities due largely to the absence of security processes in the quality assurance and development cycles. Compounding the problem is the difficulty of the coordination of security testing across multiple departments when QA is used as a hub. This presentation will expose some of the most common Web application security vulnerabilities and provide techniques and best practices to build application security testing into existing QA processes.&#160; In this presentation, you'll learn how to: 1) Understand common application vulnerabilities; 2) Select the most effective test tool for each type of vulnerability; 3) Address application security defects through dynamic and static analysis. 

More information regarding the speakers and directions can be found in the attached QAAC flyer.&#160;

We look forward to seeing you at the seminar.
