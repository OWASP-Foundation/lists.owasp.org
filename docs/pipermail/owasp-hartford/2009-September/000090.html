<PRE>Folks,

 

I have an acute need for Pen testers at my largest client.

 

These positions can be anywhere in the US, East coast preferred.  I've cut
and pasted the Job description.  For details to be shared I will only do so
over the phone once I've received a word version of your most current
resume,   THANKS 

 

Skills for a pen tester

1)      Written communication skills - they have to deliver very technical
findings to the end customer, being able to write distinctly, clearly and
comprehensively is an absolute requirement

2)      Being able to identify, describe and discuss how various security
threats in existence and how they may be identified. Specifically, be able
to discuss the OWASP top 10 web vulnerabilities.

3)      Be able to perform security assessments and penetration tests

4)      Able to develop solutions to remediate or prevent vulnerabilities.

5)      Be able to perform White (full knowledge of the system under test),
Black (no knowledge of the system), and Grey Box (some knowledge of the
system) testing 

6)      Be able to interface with clients in the pre-sales, preparation,
testing and information delivery phases

7)      Up to date knowledge of current environment for security threats,
solutions, security tools and network technologies. 

8)      Be able to do penetration testing across internal and public
networks 

9)      Be able to do network reconnaissance 

10)   Knowledge of security best practices and procedures

11)   Knows how to differentiate a penetration test (mile deep, inch wide)
from a vulnerability assessment (mile wide, inch deep)

12)   Can talk about using a tool and not simply running a tool and looking
at the results (difference between being able to do your own taxes and using
tax software, you'll use the software because it's a time saver, but if the
computer was down on April 15, you'd fill out the tax forms with confidence)

Needs to have

1)      College degree

2)      2-4 years practical pen testing/vulnerability assessment AND
remediation experience

3)      Experience and/or certifications with various vendor firewall, IDS,
proxy and other network security products

4)      Linux or Unix administration skills

5)      Scripting skills (Perl, Php, Ruby, shell, or other)

6)      Windows administration skills

Nice to have

1)      CISSP, GIAC, CISA, CISM, Ethical hacker or other security
certifications

2)      Background in specific compliance areas (PCI, HIPAA, Sarbanes-Oxley,
etc)

Must have DEPTH of practical usage and understanding of tools

13)   Nmap - network mapping and reconnaissance tool

14)   Nessus - vulnerability assessment tool

15)   Wireshark or TCPDump - network sniffer

16)   HPing - network probe tool

17)   Paros or webscarab (or other) - proxy 

18)   Ping/telnet/SSH/dig/traceroute/whois/netstat -network information
tools

They should have experience with a range other tools, some of which might
include:

1)      Nikto/Wikto - web scanner

2)      Amap - application scanner

3)      SuperScan - network scanner

4)      Cain and Abel  - vulnerability tool

5)      Dnsiff - network sniffer, pen test, auditing tool

6)      Scapy/Mausezahn - packet crafters

7)      Snort - Intrusion detection system

8)      Backtrack or similar - pen testing Linux distribution

9)      Google - ability to use Google to perform hacking/information
gathering

10)   Tripwire - file integrity monitoring

11)   Firewalk - firewall route trace tool

 

I look forward to hearing from you.
