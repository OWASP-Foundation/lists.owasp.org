Meeting Topic: Non-Relational Database Systems

As more web developers strive to make their applications scalable we see
a shift away from the traditional LAMP stack towards technologies built
with a focus on scaling. As part of this shift, a new approach to data
storage for the web is needed - the traditional RDBMS are not suited to
many of the problems that appear in large scale web applications.
Fortunately, a large number of alternatives to the RDBMS have sprung up,
each with different goals and approaches to the problem of scalability.

 

This talk provides a glimpse at some of the reasons that non- relational
database systems have become popular recently, and what that means for
web developers. It will focus on MongoDB, an open- source,
high-performance, schema-free, document-oriented database. The talk will
examine the problem domains that non-relational database systems (and
MongoDB in particular) excel at, as well as where MongoDB fits into the
overall architecture of a standard web application.

 

Presenter: Eliot Horowitz

 

As CTO of 10gen's innovative platform technology, Eliot has quickly
become one of Silicon Alley's up and coming entrepreneurs, recently
voted as one of &quot;Top 25 Entrepreneurs Under Age 25&quot; on BusinessWeek.com.
Eliot is also the chief scientist of ShopWiki's breakthrough crawling
technology. In January 2005, he began developing the crawling and data
extraction algorithm that is the core of ShopWiki's innovative
technology.

 

Prior to ShopWiki, Eliot was a software developer in the R&amp;D group at
DoubleClick. In 2004, Eliot won DoubleClick's employee coding tournament
that was designed to highlight the competitors' relative skills in the
analysis of complex algorithmic problems and the ability to write
software to solve those problems.

 

Eliot received a B.S. in Computer Science from Brown University. He
conducted research in artificial intelligence focusing on robotic
mapping and navigation. He developed a novel algorithm for mapping
spaces using a combination of support vector machines and adaboost that
allows more precise navigation of office environments.

 

IASA is the premier association focused on the IT architecture
profession through education, advocacy, events, and the development of
best practices.
