<PRE>I look forward to your participation in tonight's OWASP meeting and have
a few things to cover:

*	We have ordered lots of food and welcome attendees extending an
invite to tonight's meeting to other developers, architects and project
managers that would benefit in learning about web application security
or who just want to be part of a community that is interested in
networking and improving their skills.
*	Security has asked us to ensure that folks don't show up either
too early or too late. With this thought in mind, I ask that you not
show up earlier than 4:30 pm and no later than 5:15 pm.
*	Over the next week, I will be working on our 2010 agenda and
seek speakers from large enterprises to provide case studies along with
vendors such as Oracle, Microsoft, EMC, Accenture, McKinsey and
Cognizant to speak on practices they either use in-house or have seen
work for their clients related to making application security visible.
If you know of good speakers from these firms, please do not hesitate to
make an introduction.
*	The main OWASP site has a job board and therefore I ask that
recruiters who are subscribed to the list consider posting their job
opportunities there instead of the mailing list. I would like to reserve
the mailing list for job opportunities that are salaried in nature
(sorry to consulting assignments) and where the salary ranges are
included (the range should not vary more than 10%)
