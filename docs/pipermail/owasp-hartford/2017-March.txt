Message-ID: <9CDB4743A8E42A4DBBBF3CF91F3E17C278681CF0@TENX1MCG.prod.travp.net>

I know the NY State DFS is making its rounds for financial and insurance agencies. Is this causing angst in your respective organizations? Or do folks feel it's much ado about nothing?

http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1612281.htm
http://www.dfs.ny.gov/legal/regulations/adoptions/dfsrf500txt.pdf

"Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo today announced that the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) has updated its proposed first-in-the-nation cybersecurity regulation<http://www.dfs.ny.gov/legal/regulations/adoptions/dfsrf500txt.pdf> to protect New York State from the ever-growing threat of cyber-attacks. The proposed regulation, which will be effective March 1, 2017, will require banks, insurance companies, and other financial services institutions regulated by DFS to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of New York State's financial services industry."
