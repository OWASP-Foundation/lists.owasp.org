<PRE>My name is Jesus (not Jose, not Jorge!!!) Oquendo. Currently employed at 
a VoIP provider with multiple roles. My unofficial title &quot;network 
demolition specialist&quot; or &quot;network janitor of sorts&quot;. I've about 10 
years professional information security experience, 16 years 
professional computing experience, and overall too much time on 
computing experience beginning with the Coleco Vision Adam! (tape drives 
and all ;))

I'd like to think I'm versatile when it comes to security but a large 
portion of my focus is on the networking side of things. Network 
forensics, analysis, design, destruction, take your pick. My experience 
ranges to include most firewalls, Pix, Guantlet, Checkpoint, Stonegate, 
Sonicwall,  IPF (BSD, Solaris), IPTables too many to list. Systems 
experience includes anything under the Sun excluding z/OS. BSD, Linux, 
Solaris, QNX, Windoze, Mac System 6.0 ;) through MacOSX... Networking 
equipment too many to list, IPS/IDS ... same.

I enjoy studying the methods of intrusions and mechanisms used in order 
to understand how to protect against them. No one has ever given an 
officer a badge and told them &quot;Go catch badguys&quot; without giving them the 
training. Same should apply to security if you ask me. No security 
professional should lack in any of the OSI layers. Yes you should 
understand why FIN packets would affect you. Yes you should understand 
how to block an SQL injection. Yes you should know the difference 
between main and aggressive mode VPN's.

I could ramble on for daze(days) but most would likely want to choke me 
in person after forcing too many words to their inbox... So any other 
questions, feel free to shoot them. Some of my kooky little programs 
were included in printed works including the Certified Ethical Hacker 
guide and a couple of others. I think Lance Spitzner threw me in his 
first honeypot book unsure. Maybe I should speak to him one day ;)

So without further garblygook... Hello all.

And here is a question for some to kick off some conversation...

You have an attacker trying a typical sql insertion attack. Name three 
ways to stop them WITHOUT using an IDS/IPS ;)
