<PRE>I am of the belief that the Hartford CT area has some of the most
talented software developers on the planet, yet we are ignored by many
industry thought leaders for geographic reasons. I would like for our
chapter to be bigger than others, to have more frequent meetings of high
quality and to attract top notch speakers. Some of the folks I would
love to have present to us are:

- Window Synder, Chief Security Something of Mozilla
- Mary Ann Davidson, Chief Security Officer of Oracle
- Michael Howard, Program Manager of Security for Microsoft
- John Viega, Chief Security Architect for McAfee
- Tony Sager, Chief of Vulnerability Analysis for the National Security
Agency
- Bruce Schneier, CTO of Counterpane

For our April Meeting, we will have Anton Chuvakin of LogLogic and for
September, we will have Jeff Margolies of Accenture. I haven't yet
figured out the November event. Who else should be on our list for 2008?
