<PRE>One of the hardest things about starting a new users group is in figuring
out what makes attendees tick. Habitually, many folks in large enterprises
as well as software vendors tend to sit back and lurk which makes my job
even more difficult. I figured I would attempt to break old habits as part
of one of my News Years resolutions and ask that each person subscribed to
this list introduce themselves. Of course, I will get it started and hope
that others will chime in.

My name is James McGovern, I am an Enterprise Architect at the Hartford and
spend a lot of my day focused on enterprise security considerations. I have
been in IT for about twenty or so years and have enjoyed every moment. I am
passionate about open source and free software. I also am a blogger. In
fact, I have not missed posting a blog entry every single day for the past
two years. In 2001, I used the write the Ask Doctor Java column for Java
Developers Journal. I have co-authored six different books on various
information technology subjects. I speak at multiple industry conferences
throughout the year. I program in about a dozen languages with Java being
the most current. I am also dabbling in Ruby on Rails. Awhile back, I also
programmed in PowerBuilder and MFC.

Now, it is your turn...
