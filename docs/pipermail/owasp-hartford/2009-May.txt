Subject: [Owasp-hartford] TVA Cyber Security Tool Webinar developed by GMU
Message-ID: <92E3E380443004498826FD1FB70A4E0A01453402@be44.exg3.exghost.com>

We are hosting an online presentation on the TVA (Topological
Vulnerability Analysis) tool which was created by the Center for Secure
Information Systems (CSIS) department at George Mason University. 

 

Currently used by DHS, NSA, AFRL, FAA, DISA, NIST & US Strategic
Command, CAULDRON, allows for the transformation of raw security data
into road maps that allow users to proactively prepare for attacks,
manage vulnerability risks and have real-time situational awareness.
CAULDRON provides informed risk analysis, analyzes vulnerability
dependencies and shows all possible attack paths into a network. In this
way, it accounts for sophisticated attack strategies that may penetrate
an organization's layered defenses.
