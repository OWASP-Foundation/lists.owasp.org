Hello James:

Would  you mind sending the below to your OWASP mailing list?

There is a training (7 CPEs) being offered by ISACA-RI on September 13, 2012 at New England Institute of Technology, East Greenwich RI  - the topic is Software (In) Security - The Problem

Session Description: Software Security is integral component of an organizations overall security posture. Mr. Hannan will present real world concepts, methods, and techniques for analyzing the architecture and design of a software system for security flaws. Using this knowledge will help auditors ensure their organization is employing appropriate controls in all stages of the Software Development Life Cycle. Special attention will be given to analysis of security issues in existing applications; however, the principles and techniques are applicable to systems under development. This session will:

* Examine the techniques and methodologies to model threats, trust, and data sensitivity.
* Demonstrate how to build abuse cases and use them to explore how your software might be attacked.
* Detail three analyses foundational to architecture risk analysis as described in Gary McGraw's book, Software Security: Attack Resistance Analysis, Ambiguity Analysis, and Weakness Analysis.
* Show you how to integrate architecture risk analysis into the management of security knowledge in your organization. Software [In]Security: The Problem
* Trinity of Trouble
* Impact of Software Failure
* Trends in Security Misuse and Abuse Cases Architectural Risk Analysis
* Framework Weakness Analysis
* Attack Resistance Analysis
* Attack-Pattern Checklist
* Ambiguity Analysis
* Data, Threat and Trust Modeling Evaluating Security Controls
* Crypto Primer
* Authentication and Authorization
* Malicious Input
* State Management Recap and Review
