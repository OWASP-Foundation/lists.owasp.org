*** Hope you don't mind receiving information for other
security-relevant groups ***

A meeting December 8  is focused on IBM's implementation of SAML,
OpenID, and CardSpace, but in fact shops with competing implementations
(including Microsoft ADFS,  Oracle OIF, Siteminder FSS, or PingIdentity)
could benefit -- the promised 'Network Effect' of Identity Federation
will only be realized when standards-based interoperability is perceived
as a routine task. 
 
Please use the link below to register as a member of the group, then
sign up for the meeting on December 8.    (There are no charges
involved.)
