                        Welcome to OWASP
                        The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is
a worldwide free and open community focused on improving the security of
application software. Our mission is to make application security &quot;visible,&quot;
so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about
application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all
of our materials are available under an open source license. The OWASP
Foundation is a 501c3 not-for-profit charitable organization that ensures
the ongoing availability and support for our work.

                        Agenda: Thursday, Feb 28th 2008

                        Opening Remarks: 5:30 - 6:00 PM
                        James McGovern, Chapter Lead

                          a.. Overview of OWASP
                          b.. Survey Results
                          c.. Upcoming Speakers

                        How Web 2.0 has changed the landscape of Application
Security: 6:00 - 7:00 PM
                        Chenxi Wang, Principal Analyst at Forrester Research

                        Exploiting Online Games: 7:00 - 8:00 PM
                        Gary McGraw, CTO of Cigital



                        The talk, based on a book of the same title
(co-authored by Greg

                        Hoglund), exposes the inner workings of online game
security for all to see, drawing illustrations from MMORPGs such as World of
Warcraft to discuss:

                          a.. Why online games are a harbinger of software
security issues to come
                          b.. How millions of gamers have created billion
dollar virtual economies
                          c.. How game companies invade your privacy
                          d.. Why some gamers cheat
                          e.. Techniques for breaking onsite game security
                          f.. How to build a bot to play a game for you
                          g.. Methods for total conversion and advanced mods
                         Ultimately this talk is about security problems
associated with

                        advanced massively distributed software.  With
hundreds of thousands of interacting users, today's online games are a
bellwether of modern software yet to come.  The kinds of attack and defense
techniques described in this presentation are tomorrow's security techniques
on display today.
