<PRE>May not have to worry about it after all as we may have an entity
interested in sponsoring food and beverages...

I like the &quot;throw in $5 for pizza&quot; idea best.  Anyway, pizza would be a
bit more substantial then chips. 

Cheers,

	Whenever I attend user groups that occur during dinner time, I
tend to get very hungry and desire something to eat. Since, we haven't
had our first meeting yet, we have no budget to purchase snacks for
attendees. I was thinking that I would go out of pocket and purchase a
couple of cases of sodas and chips and have a donation jar where folks
could throw spare change to fund the next meeting. This would be left up
to the individual as to how much they would want to donate. 

	Other user group meetings that I have been to have charged $5
and included pizza. Which approach do you prefer?
