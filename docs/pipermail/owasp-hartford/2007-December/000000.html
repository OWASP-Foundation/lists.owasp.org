<PRE>I guess we should open this up for discussion. Since this is a new
chapter, we can be imaginative like an artist with a blank canvas. Any
creative mission statements? Ways to encourage more local participation?
Speakers you would like to see present? 

Our first meeting will have Dr. Gary McGraw, CTO of Cigital who is an
industry thought leader on software security. For those who aren't
familiar with this topic, check out one of his podcasts here:

p3

To appeal to both our crack app security experts and those in web
development with limited security knowledge, the goal is to have a mix
of
case studies that demonstrate app security best practices and processes
at local companies along with demonstrations of web hacking techniques.
Any suggestions prior to the meeting are certainly welcome.
