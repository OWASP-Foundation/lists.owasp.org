<PRE>Whenever I attend user groups that occur during dinner time, I tend to
get very hungry and desire something to eat. Since, we haven't had our
first meeting yet, we have no budget to purchase snacks for attendees. I
was thinking that I would go out of pocket and purchase a couple of
cases of sodas and chips and have a donation jar where folks could throw
spare change to fund the next meeting. This would be left up to the
individual as to how much they would want to donate.

Other user group meetings that I have been to have charged $5 and
included pizza. Which approach do you prefer?
