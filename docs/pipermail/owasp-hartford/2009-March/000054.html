<PRE>The Hartford Chapter of COOUG/OWASP is pleased to announce Scott Ambler
will be speaking on April 13th. This event is 100% free to attend.
Seating is limited and therefore you will need to RSVP using your work
email.

Agility and Security: Two Great Tastes Which Go Great Together

Security is usually an afterthought on software development projects,
regardless of the paradigm being followed, but it doesn't have to be
this way. Traditional approaches would have you add a lot of additional
bureaucracy to your process and the agile extremists will tell you to
write up some stories on index cards. Good luck with those strategies.
Disciplined agile teams, particularly those working at scale, have
discovered ways to address enterprise issues such as security in
effective manners which gets the job done without unnecessary
bureaucracy, albeit with more sophisticated tools than a stack of index
cards. This presentation overviews the Agile Process Maturity Model
(APMM), what it means to scale agile approaches to meet your real-world
needs, and strategies for addressing security concerns in a disciplined
agile manner.
