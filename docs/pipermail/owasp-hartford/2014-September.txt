The University of Connecticut will be hosting a two-day event bringing together all the security groups (i.e. OWASP, ISACA, ISSA, etc) along with 30 universities for a competition. Good opportunity to get out of the office and learn about security innovation. I will be on a few panels and my colleagues from HP will be talking about a new OWASP project we are starting: Internet of Things.
