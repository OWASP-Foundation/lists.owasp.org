<PRE>A new exposure is starting to circulate the security community known as
&quot;Online Binary Planting Exposure Test&quot; This test should make it easy for
users and administrators to assess their exposure to binary planting
attacks originating from the Internet.

URL: <A HREF="http://www.binaryplanting.com/test.htm">http://www.binaryplanting.com/test.htm</A>

Note that this test is NOT meant to answer whether you're vulnerable (at
this point where so many binary planting vulnerabilities exist out there
you
certainly are vulnerable if you're on a Windows system). Rather, the
test is meant to determine whether your computer or network can be
attacked from the
Internet (using any one of the known or unknown binary planting bugs).

You should also know that any network-based countermeasure (such as
blocking SMB and WebDAV at the perimeter) will stop protecting you when
you connect
your computer to another network, such as a hotel-provided or public
wireless network. Running the test in various setups you're using might
therefore be a good idea.
