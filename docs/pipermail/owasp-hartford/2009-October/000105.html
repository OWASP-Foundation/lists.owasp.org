<PRE>*	The economics of free events: The economy has had an impact on
many training budgets where the opportunity to attend paid conferences
has been reduced to almost zero, so IT employees who care about
networking and learning will gravitate towards local events that are low
cost or even free. Many IT professionals haven't put much thought into
the economics behind free conferences and need to understand the
importance of how these events happen. Enterprises provide meeting
facilities for events and sponsors cover the cost of food and beverages.
The reason they invest in free events is to gain exposure to an
audience. The more the attendees, the more vendors want to sponsor free
events. With this thought in mind, I am asking that you not only
consider attending OWASP meetings but also take time out of your busy
schedule and share the invites with others. This will go a long way to
helping bring even more free educational opportunities to you.

*	Membership: The OWASP model is like public television and
depends on the generous support of both organizations and individuals
alike. Please consider supporting the cause by joining.

*	Soda: Our chapter has partnered with a local soda manufacturer
to create our own unique flavor of soda. We will be featuring this at
our November 17th meeting.
