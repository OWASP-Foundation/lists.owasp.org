FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  


How do I respond to your postings?
The most effective way is to copy the job description and send an
updated resume- I mention &quot;updated&quot; because although you sent a resume
to me in the past, the newer version you are sending will reflect the
technologies and responsibilities specific to THAT PARTICULAR JOB. 
Hint: It doesn't hurt to paraphrase the job description into your
resume- make it obvious that you have done the work they are asking for.
Please go through the position description and job requirements item y
item to demonstrate the fit and email it back to me.
For example, if they say they want someone with two years of xyz and you
have three years, write it. If the job is to manage 6 people in the
development of such and such and you have three years doing it managing
a staff of 14, write it and send it back to me.


Since I just joined, Is there a way to access the job postings that are
currently open?
In addition to the emails that you are getting or starting to 
receive, you can access job postings by clicking on `messages&quot; on the
left side of the yahoo group page.
Job titles are in the subject line- please read them carefully.
TO FIND OUT ABOUT OTHER OPEN POSITIONS, CHECK THE MESSAGES SECTION - FOR
JOB POSTINGS THAT WERE DISTRIBUTED PRIOR TO YOU JOINING

How long should I wait to hear back after submitting my resume?
Every resume/every email gets my attention- it is not unusual to 
expect a 3-5-business day turnaround.

Do any of the other members have access to email address or my
information?
Absolutely not! This group was set up so that all members are 
anonymous to each other In addition there is no &quot;chat&quot; room for 
members. The group is designed so postings come from my desk. 

How do I unsubscribe?
To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:
<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-hartford">SEARCHQUEEN-unsubscribe at yahoogroups.com</A>
&lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-hartford">-unsubscribe at yahoogroups.com</A>&gt; 

Can my friends join your group?
Absolutely- they can log on the same way you did or just email me 
their address.
by the way,Referral fees are my way of saying thanks for your help.If
you know someone qualified for a position listed in my yahoo group,
please send me their contact information. 

** Referral fees are paid to you after a job offer is made and accepted.
When you give, you receive ten times more.
Here's to your success !
