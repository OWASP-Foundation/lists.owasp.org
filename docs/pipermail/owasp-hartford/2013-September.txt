We're less than an hour from Boston and we have a great talk coming up. Please consider coming on down to Lil Rhody and check out OWASP Rhode Island. The meeting is Monday, September 23, 6 pm at Swipely, 39 Pike St. Providence, RI.

Talk by Dr. Benjamin Lerner:

JavaScript Verification: From Browsers to Pages

Modern web browsers implement a "private browsing" mode that is intended to leave behind no traces of a user's browsing activity on their computer.  This feature is in direct tension with support for *extensions*, which let users add third-party functionality into their browser.  I will discuss the scope of this problem, present our approach to verifying extensions' compliance with private browsing mode, and sketch our findings on several real, third-party extensions.  I will then briefly describe the toolkit underlying our approach, and end with a sketch of a newer project, adapting this approach to the very different-seeming problem of statically catching errors when using the jQuery library.

Bio:  Benjamin Lerner is a post-doctoral researcher in the PLT group at Brown University, and soon to be a lecturer at Northeastern University.  His research examines the challenges of analyzing client-side web programming, from the behavior of web pages down through the semantics of the browser.  He received a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Washington in 2011, building a platform to analyze conflicts between browser extensions, and a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Yale University.
