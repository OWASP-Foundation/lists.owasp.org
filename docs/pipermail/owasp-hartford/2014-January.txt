Subject: [OWASP Hartford] OWASP Hartford: 2014 Agenda
Message-ID: <F0F009F1537F7948B0D9499C2FE5C5351C3650B0@G6W2478.americas.hpqcorp.net>

In 2014, we hope to improve our local chapter meetings by not just having technology presentations but rather to also include training on OWASP Security topics. I am thinking about leading the following:


*         June: Cross Site Request Forgery

*         September: Anti-automation

*         November: SQL Injection

The goal will be to explain in more detail what these types of attacks look like from three perspectives: builder, breaker and defender. If there are other topics you would like to get more training on, please do not hesitate to drop Narendra or I a note...

Cheers
