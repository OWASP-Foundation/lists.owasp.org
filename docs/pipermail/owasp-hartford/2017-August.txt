Sharing on behalf of Irene Markow @ UCONN:

I've attended CyberSEED together with James McGovern over the past couple
years and highly recommend attending. It's a great event and opportunity to
connect with and hear from security professionals in CT. Plus, the
conference is a giant hackathon attended by students from the nation's
leading universities!

Happy Friday,
Alvin Fong
