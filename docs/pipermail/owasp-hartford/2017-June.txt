Subject: [OWASP Hartford] Wireless security 101 - The 6/15,
	6PM @ MakeHartford
Message-ID: <CALvdwTvkfq162ABqjsBH1eBCh+9Z7DM=AXR86jXPA6X5rAOhGw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello CT OWASP-ers:

This session will take a departure from some of our recent OWASP sessions.
The hosts at MakeHartford have generously offered their classroom space for
this security lab session coming out of the OWASP pen-testing initiative
group. Jon Williams will be presenting and demonstrating some fundamental
wireless security concepts. Depending on time and if we get access to some
COTS routers, we may also try to do some hands-on wireless security
testing. Plan on bringing your laptop and spare wireless router if you can.
This session is oriented toward folks looking to learn about wireless
security and getting introduced to wireless security concepts for the first
time.

Note: Due to the classroom size, we're limiting this to the first 20
participants.

Hello Owasp-CT,


Update #1
We are happy to say that we have a Security Shephard instance up on the Virtual Village environment (many thanks to everyone involved in the setup!)  Security Shepard is a training environment for multiple types of mobile and web security testing.

You can register here:?https://173.228.153.245/register.jsp 

Check here: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Security_Shepherd for more infomation on the environment
?

Update #2
We're looking for companies / individuals that might have an interest in presenting various tools in a training/seminar environment.  Our first theme is shaping up to be appliction / code scanning tools.  

On that topic, if anyone has contacts at companies that provide app/code testing tools please send me a note off list, or leave a note on the slack training channel as we would like to start planning a session asap.

You can find our OWASP-CT Slack page here: https://owasp-ct.slack.com, if you'd like an invite please send me an email and I'll get one out asap.
 


Thanks,

*About our speaker:*

Jon Williams hails from Cheshire, CT, where he lives with his wife and
daughter and works from home as Security Administrator for IGG Software. A
taste for adventure has carried him far, from the islands of the Bahamas
where he worked towards building an eco-hostel, to the deserts of Egypt
where he taught children at environmental leadership camps, to the high
seas where he circumscribed the globe in a steamship. His passion for
technology led him into the security field, where he now spends an
unhealthy proportion of his time trying to break computer systems so that
others might improve them. He recently attained a CISSP certification and
actively contributes to projects at OWASP Hartford.

Cheers,
Alvin Fong

Thanks for everyone that attended the wireless security presentation last
week. Great run through and demos by Jon Williams on different wireless
attacks. For those of you that weren't able to make it out, we've posted
the presentation on our wiki: File:OWASP Wireless Security 101.pdf
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:OWASP_Wireless_Security_101.pdf>

Special thanks also to Steve Yanicke and all the organizers at the MakeHartford
<http://www.makehartford.com>space for hosting us.

I also wanted to share that we have our Security Shepard environment up
thanks to the help of OWASP NYC co-lead Evin Hernandez and Adam Haller, a
member of our Pen-test volunteer committee. Security Shepard
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Security_Shepherd> is a learning
platform for web, mobile security, and reverse engineering. You can
register and participate in the ongoing CTF here:
https://173.228.153.245/register.jsp

We have a recurring pen-test initiative call for those members looking to
get into the space and hear from other CT security professionals on web and
application security. We rotate through various topics, with dynamic and
static testing coming up. Ping me and I can add you to the invite.

Cheers and happy Friday,
