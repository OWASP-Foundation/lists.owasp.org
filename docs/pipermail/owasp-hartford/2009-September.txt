Subject: [Owasp-hartford] Pent tester needed ASAP
Message-ID: <F609143A85D5481BAA411F3308CF0A29@mrifranchise.local>

Folks,

 

I have an acute need for Pen testers at my largest client.

 

These positions can be anywhere in the US, East coast preferred.  I've cut
and pasted the Job description.  For details to be shared I will only do so
over the phone once I've received a word version of your most current
resume,   THANKS 

 

Skills for a pen tester

1)      Written communication skills - they have to deliver very technical
findings to the end customer, being able to write distinctly, clearly and
comprehensively is an absolute requirement

2)      Being able to identify, describe and discuss how various security
threats in existence and how they may be identified. Specifically, be able
to discuss the OWASP top 10 web vulnerabilities.

3)      Be able to perform security assessments and penetration tests

4)      Able to develop solutions to remediate or prevent vulnerabilities.

5)      Be able to perform White (full knowledge of the system under test),
Black (no knowledge of the system), and Grey Box (some knowledge of the
system) testing 

6)      Be able to interface with clients in the pre-sales, preparation,
testing and information delivery phases

7)      Up to date knowledge of current environment for security threats,
solutions, security tools and network technologies.

networks 

9)      Be able to do network reconnaissance 

10)   Knowledge of security best practices and procedures

11)   Knows how to differentiate a penetration test (mile deep, inch wide)
from a vulnerability assessment (mile wide, inch deep)

12)   Can talk about using a tool and not simply running a tool and looking
at the results (difference between being able to do your own taxes and using
tax software, you'll use the software because it's a time saver, but if the
computer was down on April 15, you'd fill out the tax forms with confidence)

Needs to have

1)      College degree

2)      2-4 years practical pen testing/vulnerability assessment AND
remediation experience

3)      Experience and/or certifications with various vendor firewall, IDS,

5)      Scripting skills (Perl, Php, Ruby, shell, or other)

6)      Windows administration skills

Nice to have

1)      CISSP, GIAC, CISA, CISM, Ethical hacker or other security
certifications

2)      Background in specific compliance areas (PCI, HIPAA, Sarbanes-Oxley,
etc)

Must have DEPTH of practical usage and understanding of tools

13)   Nmap - network mapping and reconnaissance tool

14)   Nessus - vulnerability assessment tool

15)   Wireshark or TCPDump - network sniffer

They should have experience with a range other tools, some of which might
include:

1)      Nikto/Wikto - web scanner

2)      Amap - application scanner

3)      SuperScan - network scanner

4)      Cain and Abel  - vulnerability tool

5)      Dnsiff - network sniffer, pen test, auditing tool

6)      Scapy/Mausezahn - packet crafters

7)      Snort - Intrusion detection system

8)      Backtrack or similar - pen testing Linux distribution

Subject: [Owasp-hartford] Local Seminar: Security Testing;
	How, When and Where
Message-ID: <478540.22971.qm@web81902.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

All, 

Just a quick reminder that the date for our QAAC Annual Seminar is quickly approaching.?

Please join us for a stimulating and informative day with three keynote speakers. Learn security testing strategies to apply to your projects. This is a full-day conference on Friday, September 18, 2009.

Topic: Security Testing; How, When and Where 

Location: Aetna Inc. (Lecture Hall) Middletown, CT. 

Fee: $100.00 (Includes lunch)

Plan to arrive between 7:30 ? 8:00 A.M. The conference activities will start promptly at 8:00 AM and end at 4:30 PM

Please use the ?Register Now? button on our Home Page at www.QAAC.org to make your reservation as soon as possible. Seating is limited. Reservations fill up quickly! 

Program Speaker Agenda: 

8:25 ? 9:45 ?Software Security Requirements? by Paco Hope from Cigital, Inc. Security is one of those non-functional properties of software that is difficult to specify well in requirements or traditional use cases. If we're going to come full circle with software security, we must leverage the skills and processes in our QA department. In this engaging presentation, Paco discusses misuse/abuse cases, security best practices, architectural risk analysis, and attack patterns as techniques for exploring the security needs of a product. 

10:15 ? 11:45 ?The Top 25 Software Security Vulnerabilities? by Chris Wysopal from Veracode. In this presentation, Chris takes the QA test perspective on finding the top 25 application security vulnerabilities that are most likely to be exploited by attackers by combining static, dynamic and manual test techniques. By putting security vulnerabilities into context with other security issues, he will show what testing techniques are best suited for each category. The strengths and weaknesses of automated static and dynamic analysis as well as manual methods are examined. 

1:45 ? 3:45 ?Integrating Security Tools into the QA Test Process? by Danny Allen from IBM. An estimated 75 percent of applications are released with security vulnerabilities due largely to the absence of security processes in the quality assurance and development cycles. Compounding the problem is the difficulty of the coordination of security testing across multiple departments when QA is used as a hub. This presentation will expose some of the most common Web application security vulnerabilities and provide techniques and best practices to build application security testing into existing QA processes.? In this presentation, you'll learn how to: 1) Understand common application vulnerabilities; 2) Select the most effective test tool for each type of vulnerability; 3) Address application security defects through dynamic and static analysis. 

More information regarding the speakers and directions can be found in the attached QAAC flyer.?

We look forward to seeing you at the seminar.

Meeting Topic: Non-Relational Database Systems

As more web developers strive to make their applications scalable we see
a shift away from the traditional LAMP stack towards technologies built
with a focus on scaling. As part of this shift, a new approach to data
storage for the web is needed - the traditional RDBMS are not suited to
many of the problems that appear in large scale web applications.
Fortunately, a large number of alternatives to the RDBMS have sprung up,
each with different goals and approaches to the problem of scalability.

 

This talk provides a glimpse at some of the reasons that non- relational
database systems have become popular recently, and what that means for
web developers. It will focus on MongoDB, an open- source,
high-performance, schema-free, document-oriented database. The talk will
examine the problem domains that non-relational database systems (and
MongoDB in particular) excel at, as well as where MongoDB fits into the
overall architecture of a standard web application.

 

Presenter: Eliot Horowitz

 

As CTO of 10gen's innovative platform technology, Eliot has quickly
become one of Silicon Alley's up and coming entrepreneurs, recently
voted as one of "Top 25 Entrepreneurs Under Age 25" on BusinessWeek.com.
Eliot is also the chief scientist of ShopWiki's breakthrough crawling
technology. In January 2005, he began developing the crawling and data
extraction algorithm that is the core of ShopWiki's innovative
technology.

 

Prior to ShopWiki, Eliot was a software developer in the R&D group at
DoubleClick. In 2004, Eliot won DoubleClick's employee coding tournament
that was designed to highlight the competitors' relative skills in the
analysis of complex algorithmic problems and the ability to write
software to solve those problems.

 

Eliot received a B.S. in Computer Science from Brown University. He
conducted research in artificial intelligence focusing on robotic
mapping and navigation. He developed a novel algorithm for mapping
spaces using a combination of support vector machines and adaboost that
allows more precise navigation of office environments.

Message-ID: <BFD50E79FBE23A4FB6BE93572A6FE287A6717E@AD1HFDEXC312.ad1.prod>

I look forward to your participation in tonight's OWASP meeting and have
a few things to cover:

*	We have ordered lots of food and welcome attendees extending an
invite to tonight's meeting to other developers, architects and project
managers that would benefit in learning about web application security
or who just want to be part of a community that is interested in
networking and improving their skills.
*	Security has asked us to ensure that folks don't show up either
too early or too late. With this thought in mind, I ask that you not
show up earlier than 4:30 pm and no later than 5:15 pm.
*	Over the next week, I will be working on our 2010 agenda and
seek speakers from large enterprises to provide case studies along with
vendors such as Oracle, Microsoft, EMC, Accenture, McKinsey and
Cognizant to speak on practices they either use in-house or have seen
work for their clients related to making application security visible.
If you know of good speakers from these firms, please do not hesitate to
make an introduction.
*	The main OWASP site has a job board and therefore I ask that
recruiters who are subscribed to the list consider posting their job
opportunities there instead of the mailing list. I would like to reserve
the mailing list for job opportunities that are salaried in nature
(sorry to consulting assignments) and where the salary ranges are
included (the range should not vary more than 10%)
