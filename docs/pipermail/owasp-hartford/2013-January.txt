Message-ID: <F0F009F1537F7948B0D9499C2FE5C5351B6F5EDE@G5W2725.americas.hpqcorp.net>

On February 13th, AIIM which is a non-profit organization focused on the ECM space and their New England chapter will be hosting a user group meeting on Security and other Scary Stuff. The event will focus on security and will feature two great speakers. The first will be an agent from the FBI's Information Technology Branch<http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/itb> in New Haven, CT who will talk about the threats we face online. Our second speaker will be Michelle Syc, an information security specialist at CohnReznick LLP<http://www.cohnreznick.com/>. Michelle has over 10 years of experience managing security audits, conducting security reviews including tests involving ethical hacking and social engineering in addition to being involved with systems design efforts.

The event will be hosted by our friends at ADNET Technologies<http://twitter.com/ADNETTech> at their educational facilities in Farmington, CT. The event will begin at 8:30 with a light breakfast, and there will be opportunities to talk to the speakers and the other Information Professionals in the room before the event wraps up around 11:30.

Connecting communities with otherwise disparate agendas is the best way I see in helping make application security visible...
