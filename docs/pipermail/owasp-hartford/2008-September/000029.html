	The Role of Sun, Transparency, and the OpenSolaris User Groups


	OpenSolaris user groups are independently run, but they are
hosted on opensolaris.org with open projects and/or discussion lists.
Sun participates in the OSUGs by contributing website infrastructure and
other materials from time to time. But Sun doesn't run the user groups
or the Advocacy CG, and there has never been a formal Sun program to
create and manage OSUGs. Instead, it's always been an organic, community
effort from the very beginning. Decisions about the Advocacy CG and the
user groups are made openly on advocacy-discuss and based on community
consensus. If something didn't happen on list, it didn't happen.
Everyone is encouraged to participate and share ideas, connections, and
resources.
