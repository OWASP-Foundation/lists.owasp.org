In 2015, The Hartford Chapter of OWASP is planning a strong return. Some of the topics we are considering include:


*         The Internet of Things (IoT) and new security challenges

*         Threat Modeling using Poirot

*         Incorporating Security into DevOps

*         Hacking cloud infrastructure

*         Ways to hijack applications running in Public Cloud

*         The anatomy of an attack on automobiles and medical devices

Of course we welcome any suggestions you have for upcoming topics. Please do not hesitate to share your thoughts. In the meantime, if you want to learn more about the basics of Web Application Security, I encourage you to check out these videos on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZOToVAK85MqYHbkAVK-ViD-Xb7pF6RKq
