Subject: [OWASP Hartford] May update - OWASP Pen-test initiative
Message-ID: <CALvdwTtKOgYzYUOg52y-GXAxSej4Teg2rBbDBwn6Qzs96aHsww@mail.gmail.com>

Hello follow CT OWASP-ers:

To give you guys an update on where we're at so far:


   - MakeHartford - The nice folks in the MakeHartford
   <http://www.makehartford.com>space let us use a bunch of servers they
   had racked. A bunch of us (Darren, Ty, Jon, Renie) were able to get
   together and turn it into an ESXi server. We'll be hosting some penetration
   testing/ethical hacking tools and intentionally vulnerable VMs for folks to
   cut their teeth on network and application security in a safe environment.
   Thanks again to Steve Yanicke @ MakeHartford for making the connection!


   - Virtual Village - Security Shepard: Some of you may have heard about
   the OWASP Security Shepard
   <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Security_Shepherd> project; a
   teaching tool focusing on web and mobile application security. Adam Haller
   is helping us pilot our inaugural OWASP CT class as we work to make it
   available for all our OWASP CT members. Evin Hernandez from the OWASP NYC
   chapter helped us set it up. Thanks Evin!


   - OWASP UCONN - *SUPER TOP SEKRET PROJECT* - we continue to work with
   the Cybersecurity club to build on our academic connection. If you have
   contacts in other local universities please let us know so we can connect
   with them as well to strengthen our academic partnerships.

Interested in getting involved on any of these initiatives? shoot me an
email and I'll connect you with the volunteers.

Cheers,
Alvin Fong
OWASP CT co-lead
