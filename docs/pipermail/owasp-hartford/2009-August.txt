Program Speaker Agenda: 

8:25 - 9:45 "Software Security Requirements" by Paco Hope from Cigital,
Inc. Security is one of those non-functional properties of software that
is difficult to specify well in requirements or traditional use cases.
If we're going to come full circle with software security, we must
leverage the skills and processes in our QA department. In this engaging
presentation, Paco discusses misuse/abuse cases, security best
practices, architectural risk analysis, and attack patterns as
techniques for exploring the security needs of a product. 

10:15 - 11:45 "The Top 25 Software Security Vulnerabilities" by Chris
Wysopal from Veracode. In this presentation, Chris takes the QA test
perspective on finding the top 25 application security vulnerabilities
that are most likely to be exploited by attackers by combining static,
dynamic and manual test techniques. By putting security vulnerabilities
into context with other security issues, he will show what testing
techniques are best suited for each category. The strengths and
weaknesses of automated static and dynamic analysis as well as manual
methods are examined. 

1:45 - 3:45 "Integrating Security Tools into the QA Test Process" by
Danny Allen from IBM. An estimated 75 percent of applications are
released with security vulnerabilities due largely to the absence of
security processes in the quality assurance and development cycles.
Compounding the problem is the difficulty of the coordination of
security testing across multiple departments when QA is used as a hub.
This presentation will expose some of the most common Web application
security vulnerabilities and provide techniques and best practices to
build application security testing into existing QA processes.  In this
presentation, you'll learn how to: 1) Understand common application
vulnerabilities; 2) Select the most effective test tool for each type of
vulnerability; 3) Address application security defects through dynamic
and static analysis.
