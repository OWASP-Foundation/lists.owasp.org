Subject: [OWASP Hartford] Static Analysis and Dynamic Analysis security
	testing
Message-ID: <CALvdwTvdOyk+wg-7oQeT-Q4pOtvkev_b=uBxXVcU7WbNw2HcJw@mail.gmail.com>

The OWASP CT volunteer committee was discussing doing a session on static
and dynamic analysis security testing (SAST and DAST). If you'd like to
hear more about this topic, hit reply, and let us know so we can see if
there is enough interest to form a session around it.

If you are a user of SAST and DAST tools in your environment, let us know
too as we'd like to hear from your experiences.

Cheers,
Alvin Fong

Hi folks -

This is another reminder about the local BSides Security conference in CT
is taking place Sat, Oct 7, 2017 in Southington, Ct. Their CFP is out, and
I would encourage everyone to submit a talk.

Anxious about or never given a conference talk before? Feel free to reach
out and I would be more than happy to brainstorm ideas or refine a topic
you might have. BSidesCT is as much about the local CT community of
security professionals as it is the latest and greatest in the security
industry.

Specific instructions for submitting a talk for the CFP are below and of
course additional information is available at http://www.securitybsides.
com/w/page/114611590/BSidesCT2017

*Call For Papers:*


*E-mail CFP at BSidesCT.org <CFP at BSidesCT.org>In the BODY of the email, in
order, please include:*

   - *Speaker name(s) and contact information*
   - Bio limited to 100 words for presenter or whole team

   - Presentation Title


   - Abstract of the presentation topic, limited to 200 words or less for
   use in the printed program and for the website.
   - Detailed outline or description of the topic. Get into the meat of
   what the presentation is about in detail. This really shouldn't be skipped.
   - List of other conferences at which submission has been presented or
   submitted.

Are you a potential first time presenter? Have you spoken at any other
conferences? If yes, which ones?


Good luck and looking forward to hearing from the CT security community!

Alvin Fong
OWASP CT Co-Lead
