For our last meeting in 2009, I commited to making our chapter even more
open than before. One of the things that I wanted to do in 2010 was to
give members of the chapter a say in future speakers. I have enabled our
chapter homepage (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hartford) with a
feature that will allow interested parties to propose speaking topics.
Likewise, I will also require a few participants to help govern
submissions.

Subject: [OWASP-Hartford] A massive change at DARPA
Message-ID: <BFD50E79FBE23A4FB6BE93572A6FE28702E4F690@AD1HFDEXC312.ad1.prod>

OK, many of you don't care about DARPA, but here's something that
happened there you *should* care about.  DARPA funds research, and has
historically drawn its program managers from the ranks of academia and
occasionally the military.  This is a massive change in outlook....


http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10450552-245.html

 Peiter Zatko--a respected hacker known as "Mudge"--has been tapped to
be a program manager at DARPA, where he will be in charge of funding
research designed to help give the U.S. government tools needed to
protect against cyberattacks, CNET has learned.

Zatko will become a program manager in mid-March within the Strategic
Technologies Office at DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency), which is the research and development office for the Department
of Defense. His focus will be cybersecurity, he said in an interview
with CNET on Tuesday.

One of his main goals will be to fund researchers at hacker spaces,
start-ups, and boutiques who are most likely to develop technologies
that can leapfrog what comes out of large corporations. "I want
revolutionary changes. I don't want evolutionary ones," he said.

He's also hoping that giving a big push to research and development will
do more to advance the progress of cybersecurity than public policy
decisions have been able to do over the past few decades.

many months of planning and preparation, the OWASP Development Guide
project announced today that it is ready to begin work on the next
revision of the Guide, and that that the project is looking for
volunteers to do the work, both individuals and organizations. 
 
The OWASP Development Guide is aimed at architects, developers,
consultants and auditors and is a comprehensive manual for designing,
developing and deploying secure web applications. The original OWASP
Development Guide has become a staple diet for many web security
professionals. Since 2002, the initial version was downloaded over 2
million times. Today, the Development Guide is referenced by many
leading government, financial, and corporate standards and is the Gold
standard for Web Application and Web Service security.
 
The next version of the OWASP Development Guide will be in effect the
detailed design guide for the requirements of the OWASP Application
Security Verification Standard (ASVS), which can be found here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS> . Key features of the next Guide
will include use of the new OWASP common numbering scheme. The new
numbering scheme will be common across OWASP Guides and References, more
information can be found here:
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Common_OWASP_Numbering> . Additional key
features will be the inclusion of worksheets and checklists, such as the
sample input validation worksheet which can be found here:
http://code.google.com/p/owasp-development-guide/wiki/WebAppSecDesignGui
de_D5_2_1_1
 
For more information, and for more information if you are interested in
volunteering, please see:

ntributing.pdf  Please forward this email as you think appropriate. Got
buddies and want to work on a section or two as a team? Professional
project management will be a key feature of the next release of the
Guide and can help to facilitate such arrangements. Here is what the
work streams will look like:

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Data fuels 21st century business and society.  Thanks to the rapid pace of innovation and widespread adoption of information technologies, data has become both a strategic asset and a potentially crippling liability.  As consumers grow increasingly concerned about the stewardship of their data, policymakers, academics and advocates around the world are questioning boundaries and considering risks: What is private and what is not?  How should organizations explain what they're doing with data?  What should happen when data is stolen or misused?  And, in an era of globalization, how do we manage the diverse social and legal expectations? 

 These questions are urgent in the current business climate where trust in our most basic institutions has been eroded.  As organizations growing tension between innovation, privacy and security, they are discovering that appropriate use and protection of data has broad impact on their reputations and bottom lines-a new, holistic ethos of data environmentalism is necessary.  

Earlier this year, the International Association of Privacy Professionals undertook the first benchmark study of the profession it represents-over 95% of respondents identified collaboration with information security professionals as critical to their success.  The viability of data environmentalism hinges heavily on human capital.  The time is right for a robust conversation about how the privacy and security professions can better collaborate and assure trust in our data-driven world.

J. Trevor Hughes is the Executive Director of the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP).  In this role, Hughes leads the world's largest association of privacy professionals.  

Hughes has provided testimony before the US House Commerce Committee, the US Senate Commerce Committee, the FTC, the Home Affairs Committee of the British Parliament, and the EU Parliament on issues of privacy, surveillance, spam and privacy sensitive technologies.  He is a member of the first class of Certified Information Privacy Professionals (CIPP) and recently completed, with co-author Reed Freeman, "Privacy Law in Marketing", published by Wolters Kluwer.

Hughes is an adjunct professor at the University of Maine School of Law and has lectured at Boston College, Georgetown University, and Northeastern University.  A native of Canada, Hughes holds a BA in political science from the University of Massachusetts and a Juris Doctorate from the University of Maine.
