*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*


&gt;<i> Web applications are frequently the Achilles heel of a network. A Web application has to be accessible to all of your customers and business partners. Ports 80 and 443 have to be open to the world to provide ubiquitous access to the Web application and therefore traditional protection mechanisms such as firewalls and SSL provide little security protection. On the other hand, a full-featured Web application is connected to a corporation's database storing customer information. In short: A Web application is the shortest path for an attacker to take to reach the organization's crown jewels. Securing Web applications is critical and not easy. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This joint meeting will introduce the challenges faced in developing secure web applications and how to discover from an audit perspective, any deficiencies found. You will learn about a set of process that can be put into place to allow an auditor to focus on the risk proposition and to validate defenses through automation of audit checklists.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ISACA is a leading global provider of knowledge, certifications, community, advocacy and education on information systems (IS) assurance and security, enterprise governance of IT, and IT-related risk and compliance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a worldwide free and open community focused on improving the security of application software. Our mission is to make application security &quot;visible,&quot; so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available under a free and open software license.
