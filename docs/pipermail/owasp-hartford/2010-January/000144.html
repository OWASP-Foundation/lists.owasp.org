Data fuels 21st century business and society.  Thanks to the rapid pace of innovation and widespread adoption of information technologies, data has become both a strategic asset and a potentially crippling liability.  As consumers grow increasingly concerned about the stewardship of their data, policymakers, academics and advocates around the world are questioning boundaries and considering risks: What is private and what is not?  How should organizations explain what they're doing with data?  What should happen when data is stolen or misused?  And, in an era of globalization, how do we manage the diverse social and legal expectations? 

 These questions are urgent in the current business climate where trust in our most basic institutions has been eroded.  As organizations growing tension between innovation, privacy and security, they are discovering that appropriate use and protection of data has broad impact on their reputations and bottom lines-a new, holistic ethos of data environmentalism is necessary.  

Earlier this year, the International Association of Privacy Professionals undertook the first benchmark study of the profession it represents-over 95% of respondents identified collaboration with information security professionals as critical to their success.  The viability of data environmentalism hinges heavily on human capital.  The time is right for a robust conversation about how the privacy and security professions can better collaborate and assure trust in our data-driven world.

J. Trevor Hughes is the Executive Director of the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP).  In this role, Hughes leads the world's largest association of privacy professionals.  

Hughes has provided testimony before the US House Commerce Committee, the US Senate Commerce Committee, the FTC, the Home Affairs Committee of the British Parliament, and the EU Parliament on issues of privacy, surveillance, spam and privacy sensitive technologies.  He is a member of the first class of Certified Information Privacy Professionals (CIPP) and recently completed, with co-author Reed Freeman, &quot;Privacy Law in Marketing&quot;, published by Wolters Kluwer.

Hughes is an adjunct professor at the University of Maine School of Law and has lectured at Boston College, Georgetown University, and Northeastern University.  A native of Canada, Hughes holds a BA in political science from the University of Massachusetts and a Juris Doctorate from the University of Maine.

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a worldwide free and open community focused on improving the security of application software. Our mission is to make application security &quot;visible,&quot; so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available under a free and open software license.
