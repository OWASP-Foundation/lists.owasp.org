	The Role of Sun, Transparency, and the OpenSolaris User Groups


	OpenSolaris user groups are independently run, but they are
hosted on opensolaris.org with open projects and/or discussion lists.
Sun participates in the OSUGs by contributing website infrastructure and
other materials from time to time. But Sun doesn't run the user groups
or the Advocacy CG, and there has never been a formal Sun program to
create and manage OSUGs. Instead, it's always been an organic, community
effort from the very beginning. Decisions about the Advocacy CG and the
user groups are made openly on advocacy-discuss and based on community
consensus. If something didn't happen on list, it didn't happen.
Everyone is encouraged to participate and share ideas, connections, and
resources.

> 
> Andy will be speaking on the topic of: Improve Security by Removing It from Applications

> The next evolutionary advancement in securing custom applications will involve removing security code from the application package. Application security has evolved from almost nonexistent to include security focused coding practices and functions.  Although applications will continue to need secure coding practices such as failing to a
> secure mode and secure defaults, security functions such as authentication and authorization have no place in the application package.  Abstraction of these functions can result in improved security and reduced cost of application development.

Our mission is to make application security "visible," so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about application security risks.
