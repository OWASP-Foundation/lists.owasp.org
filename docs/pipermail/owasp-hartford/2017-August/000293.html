<PRE>Sharing on behalf of Irene Markow @ UCONN:

I've attended CyberSEED together with James McGovern over the past couple
years and highly recommend attending. It's a great event and opportunity to
connect with and hear from security professionals in CT. Plus, the
conference is a giant hackathon attended by students from the nation's
leading universities!

Happy Friday,
Alvin Fong



*CyberSEED Registration Now Open*
The Comcast Center of Excellence for Security Innovation (CSI) will host
its fourth annual CyberSEED Conference and Hackathon at the University of
Connecticut on October 19-20. Student and general registration is

CyberSEED brings together industry leaders, academic researchers and
government officials to discuss emerging cybersecurity trends and formulate
best strategies for tackling current and future threats. Over 20 featured
speakers will speak, participate in panels or conduct keynote addresses at
CyberSEED 2017.

This year, the keynote speaker will be Rabia Chaudry, fellow at the U.S.
Institute of Peace, attorney and author of the *New York Times Best Seller,
Adnan&#8217;s Story: The Search for Truth and Justice after Serial. *Former

CyberSEED also brings together students from universities and colleges all
over the country to compete in unique cybersecurity competitions. The
Comcast Center of Excellence for Security Innovation offers thousands of
dollars in cash prizes for winning student teams. The competitions are
designed to test skill and efficiency in cybersecurity and teamwork. In
2016, CyberSEED brought together more than 400 participants with over 50
