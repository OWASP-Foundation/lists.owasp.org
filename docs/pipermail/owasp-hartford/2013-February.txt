Subject: [OWASP Hartford] FW: OWASP Hartford: Why We Need DevOps Now: A
 Fourteen Year Study Of High Performing IT Organizations
Message-ID: <F0F009F1537F7948B0D9499C2FE5C5351B74DFE3@G5W2725.americas.hpqcorp.net>

Gene Kim has been studying high-performing IT organizations since 1999.  He is the author of the highly acclaimed ?Visible Ops Handbook,? ?The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win,? and founder of Tripwire, Inc.

He will be presenting his findings from an ongoing study of how high-performing IT organizations simultaneously deliver stellar service levels and deliver fast flow of new features into the production environment.  To successfully deliver against what on the surface appear to be conflicting objectives, (i.e. preserving service levels while introducing significant amounts of change into production), requires creating a highly-coordinated collection of teams where Development, QA, IT Operations, as well as Product Management and Information Security genuinely work together to solve business objectives.

Gene will describe what successful transformations look like, and how those transformations were achieved from a software development and service operations perspective.  He will draw upon fourteen years of research of high-performing IT organizations, as well as work he's done since 2008 to help some of the largest Internet companies increase feature flow and production stability through applications of DevOps principles.


Biography

Gene Kim is a multiple award winning CTO, researcher and author.  He was founder and CTO of Tripwire for 13 years. He has written three books, including ?The Visible Ops Handbook? and ?The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win."  Gene is a huge fan of IT operations, and how it can enable developers to maximize throughput of features from ?code complete? to ?in production,? without causing chaos and disruption to the IT environment.  He has worked with some of the top Internet companies on improving deployment flow and increasing the rigor around IT operational processes. In 2007, ComputerWorld added Gene to the ?40 Innovative IT People Under The Age Of 40? list, and was given the Outstanding Alumnus Award by the Department of Computer Sciences at Purdue University for achievement and leadership in the profession.

Raffle

We will be raffling off two copies of Gene?s books along with other prizes (TBD). One copy of his book will automatically go to the person who forwards this calendar invite to the most individuals that generate the most attendance ?
