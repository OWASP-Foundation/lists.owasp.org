At AppSec DC, on behalf of Department of Homeland Security
National Cyber Security Division's Software Assurance program, Edmund
Wotring presented an aggregated cross-reference of:

- SAMM (http://www.opensamm.org/)
- CMMI for Acquisition (CMMI-ACQ)
- Process Reference Model For Assurance
- CERT Resilience Management Model

focusing on the overlaps, rather than the differences.  He
demonstrated an Excel tool which lets users create a status overview
against 5 domains:

- Governance
- Knowledge
- Verification
- Deployment
- Supplier management

each with 3 categories and 3 practices.

Subject: [OWASP Hartford] Token specification
Message-ID: <3D0018576183C3499481587FAE0BAAF808C5ED80@ws-mailsvr.Virtusa.com>

Have you ever attempted to integrate via custom code a Federated Identity Solution with a Web Access Management solution and ran into challenges were standards were an impediment? Please see http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/40220/draft-saml-session-token-01.odt Oracle is proposing a new standard (with some encouragement from a loudmouth who runs the Hartford chapter) to get over the hurdles of this type of integration and is very applicable to sites that use CA Siteminder, Yale CAS or equivalents. 

 

Would be great if others could provide feedback on the security, functionality, etc on this specification?

Subject: [OWASP Hartford] Update: OWASP Projects
Message-ID: <3D0018576183C3499481587FAE0BAAF808C5EFA4@ws-mailsvr.Virtusa.com>

The OWASP community at large has been very busy on a variety of open
source security related projects. Wanted to highlight a few of my
personal favorites:

 

1.       The OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide: 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Coding_Practices_-_Quick_Ref
erence_Guide

2.       The OWASP AppSensor Project: 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSensor_Project This
project is useful if you want to understand how to make your apps defend
against automated attacks.

3.       The OWASP Alchemist Project: 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Alchemist_Project This project
enables a software development team in the realization of highly secure
and defensible application with built-in defense/controls against
security-related design, coding and implementation flaws.

4.       The OWASP Secure Web Application Framework Manifesto: 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Web_Application_Framework_Ma
nifesto This project is a document detailing a specific set of security
requirements for developers of web application frameworks to adhere to
.Some of the things in it may feel familiar J

5.       The OWASP Application Security Skills Assessment: 
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Application_Security_Skills_Assessm
ent This is an online multiple-choice quiz built to help individuals
understand their strengths and weaknesses in specific application
security skills. My personal interest in this effort is to encourage
PCI/DSS auditors to find a simple way of telling when enterprises who
need to comply to PCI/DSS aren't fudging the truth and have people who
know what they are doing J

 

I encourage everyone to check out these projects and see if they add
value to your organization. If your organization finds value in OWASP,
maybe it will also consider becoming a member (
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership). Please also consider
forwarding the above information to those who could benefit. 

 

I thank you in advance for doing your part to help make web application
security "visible"...

On several occasions, this lowly chapter leader has given out advice

Jim;

Our ADC team has been monitoring this for quite awhile.  It?s only certain Regular Expressions that are vulnerable, not the full set.
I have done some work creating signatures to block specific ReDOS attacks with our WAF.

The OWASP article on this is quite good, it?s not linked to in the MS article:

The OWASP article seems more helpful and more general in nature. The 
MSDN article is Microsoft-centric (what a surprise). Thanks for the link.

Have you ever had a security question that you needed answered quickly
but couldn't find your local neighborhood security architect to provide
a perspective? There is now an online forum for solving this challenge.
Many of the members of the OWASP community at large worldwide will be
available to answer your questions. You may notice that this particular
site eschews fugly registration and avoids the whole debacle around
using IDs and passwords. 

 

Even if you don't have a question yourself, but want to make yourself
smarter regarding what others are asking, it is worthy of checking out.

I periodically circulate meeting notices from other chapters, but this
one deserves special attention. I cannot think of any future
opportunities better than this one in order to learn how to assess an
enterprise application than this one (paid or free). If anyone from the
Hartford area is interested in carpooling, please let me know...

Subject: [Owasp-boston] OWASP Boston Dec. 1 meeting

 

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Boston

 

Date - Wednesday December 1

 

Time - 6:30 p.m.

Main Topic - Application Architecture Security Assessment  - Second
session:

Presenter - Rob Cheyne, Safelight Security Advisors

In the December 1st session, Rob will conduct a sample architecture
assessment against a real-world system, and in the process, teach
participants how to conduct an architecture of their own.  Brave
volunteers will be welcome to share their own architectures and have
them reviewed. This is an opportunity to get free consulting that
typically costs thousands of dollars.  There is limited time, so not
every one will get chosen.  If you are interested in this, please
contact Rob Cheyne (rcheyne at safelightsecurity.com) directly.

Additional information:

Penetration testing is a common way to evaluate an application's
security.  Yet a comprehensive architecture and design assessment can
uncover critical security issues that often cost far less to resolve
early on in a project.  Many companies overlook this element of system
design.

Rob was one of a select few at security consulting company @stake who
regularly led and conducted full-blown enterprise-level architecture
assessments for Fortune 500 companies.  Drawing from his experience with
dozens of real-world architecture assessments over the past 12 years,
and his 20 years as a software developer, architect, and consultant, Rob
teaches students to challenge assumptions that frequently lead to
long-term security and reliability problems.
