What's it like to write a real Windows Phone 7 application? How similar 
is it to writing a regular Silverlight app? For that matter, how similar

is it to writing any standard .NET application? How do you layer your 
code? What kind of things do you unit test? Any hidden gotchas getting 
your app listed in the Marketplace? Well, Ben's written an application 
-- NPR Listener -- and it allows you to access National Public Radio 
from your Windows Phone 7 device. In this session, he'll give you a tour

of the code for NPR Listener and also share some of his thoughts on 
Silverlight and Silverlight for WP7 development.
