I profusely apologize for my negligence in not providing a chapter update in 2012. Being too busy at work is no excuse. As security becomes increasingly more important to enterprises that are regulated, when combined with industry trends ranging from Cloud Computing to the demand of consumers to respect individual privacy, OWASP is at the front and center helping enterprises understand the value proposition of making security visible.

OWASP has acknowledged the importance in not just helping enterprises learn about security but equally believe that we need to do a better job in providing the right tools to tomorrows IT professionals. With this thought in mind, I want to share with you the launch of the OWASP University chapter at Sacred Heart University. The first meeting will be held this Wednesday at 5pm Eastern in the HC 106 Humanities Center where I will be kicking it off with a discussion around SOA and Cloud security from a business and application perspective. As usual, all OWASP meetings are 100% free to attend.

An additional value in working with universities is that employers will no longer have to struggle with getting their software development teams to understand security as they will be well-prepared for the challenges that face them. If you are an employer seeking IT college students, you need to look no further than Sacred Heart University for students that are setting the example in Connecticut. Please feel free to invite IT professionals you may know to this event. It is an opportunity to network, get answers to questions that have always been top of mind and to simply help yourself understand security in the new world...

Best Wishes

James McGovern
OWASP Hartford Chapter Leader

PS. Our Hartford chapter meetings will resume in the Fall as we have lined up sponsorship. Stay tuned for more information on upcoming presentations related to mobile security, privacy, hacking RACF and other perspectives from both builders and breakers. In the meantime, I have been separating blogging on security with Gerry Gebel and insurance context.
