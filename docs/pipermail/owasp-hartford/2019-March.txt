Subject: [OWASP Hartford] List deprecating and moving to Google Groups
Message-ID: <CALvdwTtLXfdkoC8ow3rtUyxOdAvLoGhU1ACSM2NNU4ALeg0K7Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello OWASP CT:

As you've probably already received notifications of, OWASP is deprecating
the mailman list, and directing folks to move over to the Google Groups.
This list has been pretty dead for some time, so I would encourage folks to
sign up for our meetup, which is the primarily way we schedule and
coordinate events:
https://www.meetup.com/CT-Cyber-Security-Meetup-OWASP-Hartford.

We're thinking about putting together a chapter planning session for 2019,
and if you'd like to be involved, please shoot me an email about what and
where you'd like to see our chapter going as we progress through the year.

Cheers,
Alvin Fong
OWASP CT
