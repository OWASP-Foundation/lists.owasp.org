Do we have any bloggers here? If so, may I ask that you post details of
our upcoming meeting in your blog to help get the word out?

Message-ID: <7E17878DC3BD7640949FBBE9F7FCABC67950C5@AD1HFDEXC306.ad1.prod>

Figured I would give you a peak into our upcoming speakers who have
confirmed. In April, we will have Anton Chuvakin, Product Manager at
LogLogic and Jack Danahy, CTO of Ounce Labs. In September, we will have
Steven M. Christey of Mitre and Jeff Margolies of Accenture. For our
November event, we will have Jim Routh, CISO of the Depository Trust
Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and Nick Selby, Industry Analyst at the 451
Group.

We are also working on an all day event (TBD) to coincide with OWASP day
where we will have Grady Summers, CISO of GE as the keynote along with
speakers from Microsoft, BEA, EMC and the Hartford. We will be seeking
additional sponsorship for this event. We hope that area corporations
will be willing to send 10 to 20 IT employees each to this event. We are
even noodling making part of the event, more BarCamp style. For those
who are unfamiliar with BarCamps, see:
http://www.barcamp.org/TheRulesOfBarCamp

Help us make the Hartford CT chapter the best attended event on the
planet...

Cheers

Message-ID: <7E17878DC3BD7640949FBBE9F7FCABC67950BD@AD1HFDEXC306.ad1.prod>

I am of the belief that the Hartford CT area has some of the most
talented software developers on the planet, yet we are ignored by many
industry thought leaders for geographic reasons. I would like for our
chapter to be bigger than others, to have more frequent meetings of high
quality and to attract top notch speakers. Some of the folks I would
love to have present to us are:

- Window Synder, Chief Security Something of Mozilla
- Mary Ann Davidson, Chief Security Officer of Oracle
- Michael Howard, Program Manager of Security for Microsoft
- John Viega, Chief Security Architect for McAfee
- Tony Sager, Chief of Vulnerability Analysis for the National Security
Agency
- Bruce Schneier, CTO of Counterpane

For our April Meeting, we will have Anton Chuvakin of LogLogic and for
September, we will have Jeff Margolies of Accenture. I haven't yet
figured out the November event. Who else should be on our list for 2008?

One of the hardest things about starting a new users group is in figuring
out what makes attendees tick. Habitually, many folks in large enterprises
as well as software vendors tend to sit back and lurk which makes my job
even more difficult. I figured I would attempt to break old habits as part
of one of my News Years resolutions and ask that each person subscribed to
this list introduce themselves. Of course, I will get it started and hope
that others will chime in.

My name is James McGovern, I am an Enterprise Architect at the Hartford and
spend a lot of my day focused on enterprise security considerations. I have
been in IT for about twenty or so years and have enjoyed every moment. I am
passionate about open source and free software. I also am a blogger. In
fact, I have not missed posting a blog entry every single day for the past
two years. In 2001, I used the write the Ask Doctor Java column for Java
Developers Journal. I have co-authored six different books on various
information technology subjects. I speak at multiple industry conferences
throughout the year. I program in about a dozen languages with Java being
the most current. I am also dabbling in Ruby on Rails. Awhile back, I also
programmed in PowerBuilder and MFC.

Now, it is your turn...

Subject: [Owasp-hartford] Please Introduce Yourself
Message-ID: <478E5E31.4090609@infiltrated.net>

My name is Jesus (not Jose, not Jorge!!!) Oquendo. Currently employed at 
a VoIP provider with multiple roles. My unofficial title "network 
demolition specialist" or "network janitor of sorts". I've about 10 
years professional information security experience, 16 years 
professional computing experience, and overall too much time on 
computing experience beginning with the Coleco Vision Adam! (tape drives 
and all ;))

I'd like to think I'm versatile when it comes to security but a large 
portion of my focus is on the networking side of things. Network 
forensics, analysis, design, destruction, take your pick. My experience 
ranges to include most firewalls, Pix, Guantlet, Checkpoint, Stonegate, 
Sonicwall,  IPF (BSD, Solaris), IPTables too many to list. Systems 
experience includes anything under the Sun excluding z/OS. BSD, Linux, 
Solaris, QNX, Windoze, Mac System 6.0 ;) through MacOSX... Networking 
equipment too many to list, IPS/IDS ... same.

I enjoy studying the methods of intrusions and mechanisms used in order 
to understand how to protect against them. No one has ever given an 
officer a badge and told them "Go catch badguys" without giving them the 
training. Same should apply to security if you ask me. No security 
professional should lack in any of the OSI layers. Yes you should 
understand why FIN packets would affect you. Yes you should understand 
how to block an SQL injection. Yes you should know the difference 
between main and aggressive mode VPN's.

I could ramble on for daze(days) but most would likely want to choke me 
in person after forcing too many words to their inbox... So any other 
questions, feel free to shoot them. Some of my kooky little programs 
were included in printed works including the Certified Ethical Hacker 
guide and a couple of others. I think Lance Spitzner threw me in his 
first honeypot book unsure. Maybe I should speak to him one day ;)

So without further garblygook... Hello all.

And here is a question for some to kick off some conversation...

You have an attacker trying a typical sql insertion attack. Name three 
ways to stop them WITHOUT using an IDS/IPS ;)

My name is Charles Hooper. I'm a young Network Engineer for a local
ISP in New London. We deal primarily with small to medium businesses
and specialize in providing managed ISP services as well as provide
SPAM filtering to all of our customers. I used to do web development
primarily as a hobby yet still catch myself auditing software that I
use on a random basis. I used to want to be a DBA and my favorite type
of web vulnerability is SQL injection.
