CTDOTNET Event April 12th 2011 Tuesday 5:30pm -8PM at Microsoft 
Farmington CT Office.

Benjamin Day presents -
Developing a real Windows Phone 7 application

Details & registration (required) at: 
http://www.clicktoattend.com/?id=154802

What's it like to write a real Windows Phone 7 application? How similar 
is it to writing a regular Silverlight app? For that matter, how similar

is it to writing any standard .NET application? How do you layer your 
code? What kind of things do you unit test? Any hidden gotchas getting 
your app listed in the Marketplace? Well, Ben's written an application 
-- NPR Listener -- and it allows you to access National Public Radio 
from your Windows Phone 7 device. In this session, he'll give you a tour

of the code for NPR Listener and also share some of his thoughts on 
Silverlight and Silverlight for WP7 development.

Bio:
Benjamin Day is a consultant and trainer specializing in software 
development best practices using Microsoft's development tools with an 
emphasis on Silverlight, Team Foundation Server, Windows Azure, and 
Scrum. He is a Microsoft Visual Studio ALM MVP and a certified trainer 
for the new Professional Scrum Developer course from Scrum.org. When not

developing software, Ben likes to hang out with his wife and cats, play 
jazz piano, and geek out on all things food. He can be contacted via 
http://www.benday.com and http://blog.benday.com.
