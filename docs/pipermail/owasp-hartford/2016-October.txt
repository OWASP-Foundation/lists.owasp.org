The BSIMM is a measuring stick for software security. The best way to use the BSIMM is to compare and contrast your own initiative with the data about what other organizations are doing contained in the model. You can then identify goals and objectives of your own and refer to the BSIMM to determine which additional activities make sense for you.

The BSIMM data show that high maturity initiatives are well-rounded-carrying out numerous activities in all 12 of the practices described by the model. The model also describes how mature software security initiatives evolve, change, and improve over time.

Less familiar with BSIMM, but we had used OWASP OpenSAMM http://www.opensamm.org/ to do an initial review of software assurance maturity model for application security, and Forrester maturity for a broader information security maturity assessment. If there is interest, I'm wondering if there would be value in pulling together local Hartford benchmarking information so we could compare apples to apples with an industry overlay (insurance, healthcare, manufacturing, finance, technology etc).

In comparing/contrasting SAMM vs BSIMM, you will conclude:


-        SAMM is open and community driven. BSIMM is driven by a single vendor

-        SAMM is better in addressing the qualitative aspects of application security and connected to the OWASP body of knowledge whereas BSIMM is more quantitative and connected to the consulting model of the particular vendor that drives it

-        For organizations that are starting off, they may need prescriptive guidance which is anti-agile. For organizations that are capable of doing own understanding then SAMM is available at a lower total cost.

Subject: RE: BSIMM: Application Security Maturity Models

Less familiar with BSIMM, but we had used OWASP OpenSAMM http://www.opensamm.org/ to do an initial review of software assurance maturity model for application security, and Forrester maturity for a broader information security maturity assessment. If there is interest, I'm wondering if there would be value in pulling together local Hartford benchmarking information so we could compare apples to apples with an industry overlay (insurance, healthcare, manufacturing, finance, technology etc).

Subject: [OWASP Hartford] BSIMM: Application Security Maturity Models

The BSIMM is a measuring stick for software security. The best way to use the BSIMM is to compare and contrast your own initiative with the data about what other organizations are doing contained in the model. You can then identify goals and objectives of your own and refer to the BSIMM to determine which additional activities make sense for you.

The BSIMM data show that high maturity initiatives are well-rounded-carrying out numerous activities in all 12 of the practices described by the model. The model also describes how mature software security initiatives evolve, change, and improve over time.
