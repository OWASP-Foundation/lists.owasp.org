Traveling?
We've negotiated a discount rate on block of rooms at a local hotel. If you will be travelling in from out of town and looking for a decent rate, please let us know (by sending a message to bsides at nesit.net<mailto:bsides at nesit.net>)  so that we can work with the hotels to get the best rate.

What to expect?
BSidesCT is being hosted at the 290 Pratt ST industrial complex.  The space we're hosting our event in was formally used for industrial purposes, as such we suggest attendees dress appropriately (jeans, t-shirt ect...) See http://www.thehackerspace.com/The_HackerSpace/Gallery_Archives__1/Pages/Building_Workspace.html#11

<http://www.thehackerspace.com/The_HackerSpace/Gallery_Archives__1/Pages/Building_Workspace.html#11>
The conference area is a large cavernous space (nearly 8,000 SQ Feet) which is conducive to an event like BSides and where conversations for the next big thing are sure to start.

FOOD and drink!
We will have a limited supply of complimentary coffee and bottled water for attendees. We'll also have a vending machine available. For actual real food the Panino Eatery is be open during the day which is located within the 290 Pratt ST facility. Or there are a number of other local eateries http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=food&aq=&sll=41.540964,-72.78863&sspn=0.013459,0.027874&ie=UTF8&hq=food&hnear=&t=h&z=16

O.K I found the building how do I get in?
Great question - As you can see from this youtube video this is a pretty big facility, and it's rather easy to get lost

We recommend you follow the signs we have posted and enter the building via the east entrance which is directly behind the CLUB 24 on the right side of the building.
