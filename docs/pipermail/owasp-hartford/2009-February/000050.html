<PRE>So, here are some of the questions.
 
1. The notion of a relationship card seems applicable to consumer
scenarios such as AARP issuing cards to the eldery or AAA to automobile
drivers. Who within Higgins is making this technology known?
 
2. Usage of cards seems to be coupled to an otherwise disconnected
conversation. For example, I could see value in using cards within my
own industry vertical but don't know enough of my IT peers to make it
happen. Software vendors such as Sun, PingIdentity, IBM, Oracle, RSA do
however yet they have no incentive to wire any of us together to have a
conversation. Much of the technology in this space is sold point to
point where vendors would like introductions to others but don't think
they have a part in community formation. They are quick to point out in
handwaving fashion the notion of the NDA but if you really think about
it, what enterprise would have a strategy around cards, federated
identity, etc and want to not let the outside world know about it?
Federation is the antithesis to NDA so how do vendors get a clue?
 
3. Even if either of you don't know how to make the vendor breakthrough,
could you ask this question of others in industry forums such as at Sun
conferences on identity, Project Concordia, Liberty Alliance meetings,
etc?
 
4. What is the intersection between biometrics and cardspace? Anyone
noodling wiring biometrics into an identity selector?
 
5. Sun has shown leadership in terms of XACML where the ability to
represent more than just simple name/value pairs is possible within an
assertion. How should Cards involve to support XACML?
 
6. How should Information Cards in its various forms along with
Biometrics look like when stored in LDAP? Are there specific OIDs that
should be considered?
 
7. What should OWASP be noodling when it comes to incorporating Cards
into web applications? They already have guidance on passwords?
 
8. What should OWASP be noodling when it comes to incorporating
biometrics into web applications? Could Ramesh contribute a top ten
list?
