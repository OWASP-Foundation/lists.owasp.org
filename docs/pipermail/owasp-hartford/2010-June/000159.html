<PRE>The Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., a property and casualty insurer,
said Wednesday that despite a drop in its stock price the company has strong
liquidity.
Since the beginning of the week, the stock has fallen 28 percent. It fell
another $3.71, or 9 percent, to $37.28 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the entire market has been volatile, as the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 777 on Monday and then climbed nearly 500 points on Tuesday,
amid turmoil in the financial sector and a government bailout plan that was
voted down.

&quot;We are disappointed with our recent stock performance but recognize we are
living through a period of unprecedented market conditions,&quot; the company
said in a statement. &quot;The Hartford's core operating businesses are
performing well and our liquidity remains strong.&quot;

The company added it is confident in its ability to meet its commitments to
customers.
