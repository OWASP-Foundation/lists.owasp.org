The Hartford chapter of OWASP was intentionally quiet during the summer
months, but now that summer is coming to an end, I hope to change that.
One of my commitments that I made at the beginning of the year was that
I would attempt to choose speakers/topics that are of interest to the
larger community and not just topics of personal interest. Please keep
me honest in this regard and provide a few suggestions.

In the meantime, we are planning our next meeting in the October
timeframe. I hope to share details in the next two weeks. For those who
will be attending the annual OWASP conference next week in California
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSec_US_2010,_CA) , drop me a note and
let's figure out how to hookup. 

I am declaring a preemptive strike on my 2011 chapter goals which will
include embracing social media as a way for all of us to collaborate.
Increasingly, our day jobs are taking much more of our time, robbing us
of our opportunity to learn and grow. While we cannot always attend
chapter events in person, we can still connect to each other. If you
leverage social media sites such as LinkedIn and/or Twitter, let's start
connecting with each other. My Twitter handle is
http://twitter.com/McGovernTheory and I would like to build a list of
other members of our chapter.

For chapter members who either are unemployed or know other talented IT
professionals who are unemployed or simply looking for a better
opportunity, please contact me off list as I know of several
opportunities for Architects, Project Managers and Business Analysts.

Hopefully, everyone enjoyed their Summer and will have a fruitful Labor
Day...

Cheers

Subject: [OWASP Hartford] Online Binary Planting Exposure Test
Message-ID: <3D0018576183C3499481587FAE0BAAF8085B1F56@ws-mailsvr.Virtusa.com>

A new exposure is starting to circulate the security community known as
"Online Binary Planting Exposure Test" This test should make it easy for
users and administrators to assess their exposure to binary planting
attacks originating from the Internet.

URL: http://www.binaryplanting.com/test.htm

Note that this test is NOT meant to answer whether you're vulnerable (at
this point where so many binary planting vulnerabilities exist out there
you
certainly are vulnerable if you're on a Windows system). Rather, the
test is meant to determine whether your computer or network can be
attacked from the
Internet (using any one of the known or unknown binary planting bugs).

You should also know that any network-based countermeasure (such as
blocking SMB and WebDAV at the perimeter) will stop protecting you when
you connect
your computer to another network, such as a hotel-provided or public
wireless network. Running the test in various setups you're using might
therefore be a good idea.
