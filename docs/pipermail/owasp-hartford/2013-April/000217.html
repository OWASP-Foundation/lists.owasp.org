Agenda: 

Start

Item

8:30

Coffee - courtesy IBM, Ilantus

8:50

Business Meeting:  Is a rename in order?

IBM has reorganized and moved the security products out of the Tivoli
brand.  The new brand is IBM Security.

Identity Brokerage: beyond point-to-point.  Ilantus Technologies

Anurag Rai, Vice President - Consulting &amp; Advisory Services and 

Kevin McNally- Director of Sales 

Anurag is an advisor in Information Security, Compliance, Audit and Risk
Management space working with clients in architecture, design, and
implementation.  He is responsible for all the consulting and advisory
activities in the North American region. 

Kevin has twenty plus years of enterprise software experience at both
industry-leading enterprise software companies and several early stage
start-ups.

This presentation is about scaling up federation.  If a company wants to
federate with many customers and the customers in turn want to federate
with other companies, the default point-to-point pattern becomes an N2
scaling problem.  Are there ways to make the management of federation
more scalable?  

 

10:00

Provisioning strategies for Cloud Applications, IBM

Brian Matthiesen, manager of the Identity Adapter development team and
the Identity Architects team

Robin Cohan, Product Manager for IBM's Identity Management Portfolio

This is about the cloud space, where the service vendor has an identity
store and corporate security needs to keep track of who is enrolled.
What are the ways that the accounts can be enrolled, periodically
certified and eventually disabled or un-enrolled? We will discuss a
maturity model approach to help enterprises govern their cloud-based
applications, spanning user lifecycle management, access governance,
federation and risk-based authentication.

10:50

Break (20 minutes)

11:10

NSTIC &amp; Identity Ecosystem Overview 

George Dobbs, Enterprise Architect, Mass Mutual Financial Group

George is currently working on customer facing identity and access
control solutions and is a member of the Identity Ecosystem Steering
Group.

This presentation is about the United States' effort to encourage the
development of the national strategy for trusted identities in
cyberspace.  George will provide a short introduction and suggest a
picture of a possible future state.
