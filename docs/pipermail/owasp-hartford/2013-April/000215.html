Agenda:


8:30    Coffee &#8211; courtesy IBM, Ilantus

8:50    Business Meeting:  Is a rename in order?
IBM has reorganized and moved the security products out of the Tivoli brand.  The new brand is IBM Security.

9:10    NSTIC &amp; Identity Ecosystem Overview
George Dobbs, Enterprise Architect, Mass Mutual Financial Group
George is currently working on customer facing identity and access control solutions and is a member of the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group.
This presentation is about the United States&#8217; effort to encourage the development of the national strategy for trusted identities in cyberspace.  George will provide a short introduction and suggest a picture of a possible future state.

10:00   Identity Brokerage: beyond point-to-point.  Ilantus Technologies
Anurag Rai, Vice President - Consulting &amp; Advisory Services and
Kevin McNally- Director of Sales
Anurag is an advisor in Information Security, Compliance, Audit and Risk Management space working with clients in architecture, design, implementation.  He is responsible for all the consulting and advisory activities in the North American region.
Kevin has twenty plus years of enterprise software experience at both industry-leading enterprise software companies and several early stage start-ups.
This presentation is about scaling up federation.  If a company wants to federate with many customers and the customers in turn want to federate with other companies, the default point-to-point pattern becomes an N2 scaling problem.  Are there ways to make the management of federation more scalable?


10:50   Break (20 minutes)

11:10   Provisioning strategies for Cloud Applications
Sridhar Muppidi, Chief Architect, IBM Security Solutions
Sridhar Muppidi is a Senior Security Architect with IBM Security Systems. Sridhar has been covering identity and access management, fined grained authorization, web services security, SOA, Data and Endpoint security for over a decade.
This is about the cloud space, where the service vendor has an identity store and corporate security needs to keep track of who is enrolled.   What are the ways that the accounts can be enrolled, periodically certified and eventually disabled or un-enrolled? We will discuss a maturity model approach to help enterprises govern their cloud-based applications, spanning user lifecycle management, access governance, federation and risk-based authentication.
